    appellant, Norman Baker, was convicted by a judge and jury of criminal negligence
    causing bodily harm contrary to s. 221 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C.
    1985, c.&nbsp;C-46, and of failing to remain at the scene of a boating accident
    and offer assistance to persons injured or appearing to require assistance
    contrary to s. 252(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Mr. Baker appeals his
    convictions on both counts.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.

    remain to be followed by a conditional sentence of fifteen months less a
    day on the criminal negligence count.</p>

line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly
    after 11:30 p.m. on August 5, 2000, the boat that Mr. Baker was driving on
    Pigeon Lake collided with another boat occupied by an elderly couple, Mr.
    and Mrs. Peat.  Mr. Baker left the scene and returned to his cottage.  The
    Peats’ vintage wooden boat was damaged beyond repair.  It quickly filled
    with water and sank.  Both the Peats were rendered unconscious.  Mr. Peat,
    who soon regained consciousness, attempted to swim to shore while struggling
    to keep his unconscious wife from drowning.  They were rescued by cottagers
    who were investigating the noise made by the collision.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Baker testified that after the collision, he looked around in the dark briefly,
    saw that his boat was extensively damaged and quickly returned to his cottage
    as he was concerned that his boat might sink.  He testified that he did not
    see another boat before the collision and thought he had hit either a rock
    or the western edge of Snake Island.  He did not call out to see if anyone
    needed help because he did not think he had struck another boat.  Once he
    was back in his cottage, Mr. Baker checked himself for injuries and went
    to bed.</p>

    support of his convictions appeal, Mr. Baker submits that the trial judge
    erred in a number of ways in his charge to the jury, namely:</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber3 style='text-align:justify'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>by
    failing to meaningfully define the extent of the departure from the standard

    negligence;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber3 style='text-align:justify'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>by

    an accident;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber3 style='text-align:justify'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>by
    using the phrase “good reason to know” in his instructions regarding the
    knowledge components of the fail to remain charge, thus permitting conviction
    without proof of subjective knowledge on the part of Mr. Baker;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber3 style='text-align:justify'>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in
    explaining the standard for Mr. Baker to rebut, with evidence to the contrary,
    the presumption in s. 252(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> that he intended
    to escape civil or criminal liability; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber3 style='text-align:justify'>5.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>by
    placing the issue of Mr. Baker’s “post offence conduct” before the jury as
    evidence of consciousness of guilt, and by failing to relate that conduct
    to particular issues in the trial adequately.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    Baker submits that the trial judge erred by failing to meaningfully define
    the extent of the departure from the standard of a reasonable boat operator
    necessary to permit a conviction for criminal negligence.  In particular,
    he submits that the trial judge did not marshal the evidence relevant to
    determining the manner in which a reasonable boat operator would have proceeded.  Mr.
    Baker submits that the trial judge also erred by failing to distinguish the
    criminal negligence standard (a marked and substantial departure from the
    conduct expected of a reasonable person) from that of mere civil negligence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Baker objects to the trial judge’s instruction that the Crown may prove a
    marked and substantial departure from what a reasonably prudent person would
    do in the same circumstances “in either of two ways: by proving that the
    defendant was aware of a danger or risk to the lives or safety of others
    but went ahead anyway, or, by proving that Mr. Baker simply gave no thought
    to the possibility that any such risk existed.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Baker submits that both these formulations could only have the effect of
    diluting the extent of the departure from the norm required for criminal
    negligence.  He submits that both fail to gauge, in any way, the level of
    risk that is contemplated.  As a consequence, both could easily capture conduct
    that was mere civil negligence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not give effect to this ground of appeal.  The charge was clear that
    the Crown must prove that the impugned conduct was more than carelessness
    and amounted to a marked and substantial departure from that of a reasonably
    prudent boater in the circumstances.  The trial judge thoroughly reviewed
    the evidence that might assist the jury in making that determination.  After
    that review, he reminded the jury that the test was whether it was proved
    that Mr. Baker had shown a wanton and reckless disregard for the lives and
    safety of others.  Read as a whole, therefore, the trial judge’s instructions
    could not have misled or confused the jury regarding either the standard
    against which Mr. Baker’s conduct was to be judged, or the mental element
    required for a conviction for criminal negligence causing bodily harm.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown conceded that the trial judge may have erred by instructing the jury
    that the boat’s speed could be inferred from the level of damage without
    expert evidence.  If this is error, its inclusion with the several other
    factors left to the jury in relation to the speed Mr. Baker was driving did
    not occasion prejudice or result in a miscarriage of justice.</p>

    Baker also argues that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury in regard
    to the failure to remain charge.  Mr. Baker was convicted under s. 252 of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i>, which reads:</p>

    trial judge began his instructions regarding this count by listing the essential
    elements that the Crown had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>Number one, that Mr. Baker had care, charge or control of a
    vessel.  Number two, that the vessel was involved in an accident.  Number

    four, that someone involved in the accident was injured or, apparently, in
    need of assistance.  Number five, that Mr. Baker knew that someone involved
    in the accident was injured or required assistance.  Number six, that Mr.
    Baker failed to stop and identify himself after the accident.  Number seven,
    that Mr. Baker failed to offer assistance to [the Peats] who were injured
    or required assistance and, number eight, that Mr. Baker intended to escape

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='

line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Baker objects to the trial judge’s observation to the jury that: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>A vessel is involved in an accident when it is operated in such a way that
    it comes into contact intentionally or unintentionally with a person, [or]
    another vessel.  There is really no issue that Mr. Baker’s vessel was involved
    in an accident because he admitted to [the investigating police officer]
    that his boat was in an accident that night and, therefore, you can go on
    to question number three.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Baker submits that this instruction deprived him of the frontline of his
    defence to this count, because it implied to the jury that he knew he had
    been involved in an accident to which s. 252(1) applies.  Section 252(1)
    only applies to an accident with another person or a vehicle, vessel or aircraft.  Mr.
    Baker’s defence was that, while he knew he had been in a collision, he had
    no knowledge it was with a person or another vessel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Considering
    this passage in the context of the charge as a whole, I conclude that the
    jury could not have been misled into thinking that Mr. Baker had conceded
    that he knew he had collided with a person or another vessel.  First, the
    passage is part of the trial judge’s instruction on the second question that
    he had identified at the outset.  This question concerned a purely factual
    matter: whether Mr. Baker’s vessel had been in an accident.  The third question
    listed by the trial judge related to whether Mr. Baker had subjective knowledge
    that his vessel had been involved in an accident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Immediately
    following the impugned passage relating to the second question, the trial
    judge instructed the jury concerning the third question that the Crown had
    to prove: whether Mr. Baker knew that his vessel was involved in an accident.  In
    doing so, the trial judge repeatedly told the jury that Mr. Baker testified
    that he thought he had hit a rock and not a boat.  In this context, the jury
    would have understood that the trial judge used the word “accident” during
    the discussion of the second question to mean merely a collision.  Mr. Baker
    himself used the word “accident” in the same sense in his statement to the
    police.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:
normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    question asked by the jury demonstrates that it understood that Mr. Baker
    had not conceded his involvement in an accident to which s. 252(1) applies.  The
    jury asked, “At which point does leaving happen? – i.e. if Baker doesn’t
    realize he’s been in an accident until he gets home, does doing nothing at
    home constitute
    ‘leaving’?”  This shows that the jury appreciated that the Crown had to prove
    that Mr. Baker knew he had been in an accident to which s. 252(1) applies.</p>

line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    primary ground of appeal advanced by Mr. Baker relates to the trial judge’s
    instructions regarding the circumstances of which the Crown had to prove
    that Mr. Baker had knowledge when he engaged in the prohibited conduct of
    leaving the scene of the accident.  These are that Mr. Baker had knowledge
    that he was involved in an accident with another vessel and that he had knowledge
    that someone was injured or appeared to need assistance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    regard to these components, the trial judge instructed the jury on the doctrine
    of wilful blindness.  In doing so, he repeatedly used the phrase “good reason
    to believe”.  Mr. Baker argues that the judge erred by using this phrase.  He
    points out that wilful blindness rests on a finding of subjective deliberate
    ignorance and submits that this phrase indicates an objective standard of
    what a reasonable person would believe in the circumstances.  He argues that
    the instruction could have misled the jury into convicting upon the objective
    standard for civil negligence.</p>

    Baker relies on this court’s decision in <i>R. v. Phillips</i>, [2005] O.J.
    No. 155. The appellant in that case was convicted of failing to stop at the
    scene of a traffic accident.  While driving a truck, he struck and killed
    a pedestrian and left the scene.  Though the appellant had not testified,
    he had said to a tow truck driver that he thought he had struck a dog.  In
    its brief endorsement dismissing the appeal, this court said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The trial judge’s
    use of the expression “good reason to believe” in relation to the knowledge
    required of the appellant was in error because the essential element of the
    offence requires actual knowledge or willful blindness and should have been
    described as such for the jury.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Baker submits that this court in <i>Phillips</i> disapproved of the use of
    the phrase “good reason to believe” as part of an instruction on wilful blindness.  I
    do not accept that contention.  The court’s entire discussion of the phrase
    is contained in the passage above.  It is not clear how and in what context
    the phrase was used in the <i>Phillips</i> charge to the jury.  It seems
    to me that this court would not so casually disapprove of what is a significant
    component of the standard jury charge on a count of failing to remain.  I
    do not regard <i>Phillips</i> as rejecting any use of the phrase “good reason
    to believe” in an instruction to the jury on a fail to remain count.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, whether the phrase “good reason to believe” is improper depends
    on the context in which it is used.  The phrase can be used to indicate an
    objective standard.  However, it can also be used to address the accused’s
    subjective belief.  The trier of fact cannot directly determine what actually
    went on in the mind of the accused and must infer that state of mind from
    the accepted facts.  The phrase can quite properly be used to identify the
    basis for inferring the accused’s state of mind.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the trial judge began his instructions regarding whether Mr. Baker
    knew that his vessel was involved in an accident as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>This element
    has to do with Mr. Baker’s state of mind, his knowledge that the vessel he
    was operating was involved in an accident.  Several times with respect to
    this count, I am going to be speaking to you about the element having to
    do with Mr. Baker’s “state of mind”.  This is a different test than what
    I spoke to you earlier about with respect to criminal negligence and dangerous
    driving when I was speaking to you about what a reasonable person’s state
    of mind might be.  With respect to this charge, with respect to the elements
    that I am speaking to you about, we are dealing here with Mr. Baker’s state
    of mind, his knowledge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    instruction clearly directed the jury that it was to consider Mr. Baker’s
    own state of mind.  The judge took care expressly to distinguish a reasonable
    person’s state of mind from the question to be decided.  The trial judge
    then continued:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Knowledge includes
    not only sure knowledge, in this case, that the accident occurred, but also
    good reason to believe that it might have occurred.  You may, for example,
    be persuaded that Mr. Baker knew for sure that his vessel was involved in
    an accident or you may be persuaded that, even though Mr. Baker did not know
    for sure, he had good reason to believe that he might have been involved
    in an accident but kept on going without bothering to check or you may be
    persuaded that Mr. Baker knew he should have checked to see if he had been
    involved in an accident, but deliberately failed to do so because he did
    not want to know the truth.  In any case, if you are satisfied beyond a reasonable
    that Mr. Baker knew about the accident or had good reason to believe it might
    have occurred, this essential element has been proved.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    instructions could not mislead the jury into thinking that the issue was
    whether a reasonable person had “good reason to believe”
    there had been an accident.  Rather, the instructions were clear that the
    jury had to consider whether Mr. Baker had
    “good reason to believe” he might have been involved in an accident.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge used the phrase “good reason to believe” in the same way in his
    instructions regarding the issue whether Mr. Baker knew that someone involved
    in the accident was injured or apparently in need of assistance.  However,
    in regard to whether someone appeared “to require assistance” he added that
    it was enough if
    “a reasonable person would think that that person seemed to require assistance”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is unnecessary to decide if the reference to a reasonable person in this
    context was proper, as it was irrelevant to this case and could not prejudice
    Mr. Baker.  Mr. Baker’s testimony was clear that he did not see anyone involved
    in the accident at all.  The trial judge told the jury unambiguously that
    Mr. Baker’s position was that he saw nobody at the site of the accident.  Therefore,
    the standard to be used to determine whether a person involved in the accident
    may have seemed to require assistance did not arise.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    conclude that the trial judge’s repeated use of the phrase
    “good reason to believe” in the manner in which it was employed in this case
    did not give rise to the possibility that Mr. Baker might have been convicted
    on a standard of what would be expected of a reasonable person.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, the evidence overwhelmingly supported the inference, beyond a
    reasonable doubt, that Mr. Baker knew that he had been involved in an accident
    with another boat or that he had a real suspicion that he had been so involved
    and chose not to make an inquiry.  Most pertinent is Mr. Baker’s admission
    in cross-examination that he noticed pieces of wood in his boat when it came
    to a brief stop after the collision.  He testified that he thought that the
    wood was debris from his own boat.  His own fibreglass boat, which did have
    wood underpinning, was damaged at the top of the hull in that the rub rail
    was completely ripped off.  His awareness of wood pieces in his boat, and
    the fact that his boat suffered damage well above the place where an impact
    with a rock would have occurred, compels the inference that Mr. Baker knew
    or suspected that he had collided with another boat.  </p>

    failed to stop his vessel and offer assistance to the Peats is, in the absence
    of evidence to the contrary, proof of intent to escape civil or criminal
    liability.  In his instructions to the jury, the trial judge said, “evidence

    means “evidence that you do not reject that leads you to believe or have
    a reasonable doubt that Mr. Baker intended to escape civil or criminal liability

    the contrary” in that way.  He says that “evidence to the contrary” is merely
    evidence that has not been rejected and that tends away from the presumed
    intent, and that, where there is such evidence on the record, the jury is
    required to determine guilt or innocence in the absence of the presumption.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the trial judge put the matter properly.  There is no lower standard
    of proof, below reasonable doubt, that can be relied upon to rebut a presumption.
    In <i>R. v.</i> <i>Boucher</i>, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 499, at para. 21, the Supreme
    Court said of a different but similar presumption:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Evidence to
    the contrary that is adduced to rebut the presumption of accuracy in s. 258(1)(<i>g</i>) <i>Cr.
    C.</i> must tend to show that the certificate does not in fact correctly
    reflect the blood alcohol level at the time of the breathalyzer test. This
    evidence must raise a reasonable doubt about the accuracy of the breathalyzer
    result.</p>

      there is nothing in the evidence adduced by the Crown from which a reasonable
      doubt can arise, then the accused will necessarily have the burden of adducing
      evidence if he is to escape conviction.  However, he will not have the
      burden of proving his innocence, it will be sufficient if, at the conclusion
      of the case on both sides, the trier of fact has a reasonable doubt.</span></p>

    for Mr. Baker submits that the trial judge erred by instructing the jury
    that Mr. Baker’s conduct and statements after the collision could be considered
    as “post-offence conduct” that might constitute evidence of consciousness
    of guilt.  He contends that, in this case, Mr. Baker’s conduct after the
    event was as consistent with the defence position as it was with the Crown’s
    position.  As such, he says, there was no evidentiary foundation for a post-offence
    conduct charge in this case.  Moreover, he submits, the trial judge failed
    to assist the jury by relating the alleged post-offence conduct to particular
    issues in the trial.</p>

    counsel at trial relied on Mr. Baker’s conduct after the collision to show
    that he behaved throughout as a person who had nothing to hide and believed
    he was involved in a collision with a rock, not another vessel.  The Crown
    relied on his conduct after the event to show consciousness of guilt.  The
    trial judge reviewed the positions of both parties and left it to the jury
    to consider whether Mr. Baker’s conduct after the accident should be interpreted
    favourably or unfavourably to him.  He properly presented it as merely some
    evidence that the jury could consider, and which they may or may not find
    helpful.  He reviewed the evidence and related it to the question of “whether
    the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt whether Mr. Baker intended
    to escape civil or criminal liability for the accident”. </p>
