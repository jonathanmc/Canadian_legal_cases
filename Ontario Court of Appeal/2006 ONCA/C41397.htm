  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the sentence imposed by
    Justice Arthur C. Whealy of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury,
    on April 16, 2003</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>.</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted after a trial before a
    judge and jury of 16 counts of acts of violence and sexual aggression and
    related offences against his former wife, which occurred between 1992 and
    1994.  The appellant was designated as a
    dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate period of
    imprisonment.  He appeals that
    designation and the related sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During the four years that the appellant and his former
    wife lived together, he perpetrated vicious attacks against her, including
    rapes, beatings and cruel threats.  The
    relationship ended when the appellant was sentenced to five years in the
    penitentiary for similar conduct of violence and sexually violent crimes
    involving another former spouse.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge essentially accepted the evidence of
    the Crown’s expert.  The appellant
    suffers from anti-social personality disorder, with additional co-morbid,
    prominent borderline and narcissistic personality traits.  He is deceitful, impulsive, irritable and
    assaultive.  He has a poor record in
    terms of counselling and treatment.  He
    failed to abide by earlier parole conditions specifically related to these
    offences and has refused to accept responsibility for the offences.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge rejected the appellant’s evidence.  More specifically the trial judge rejected
    the appellant’s evidence that he had cured himself of his addiction to drugs
    and alcohol.  The trial judge took this
    assertion as a sham meant only to persuade the court that he is a likely
    candidate for the long-term offender status and the treatment being
    recommended. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the appellant submits that the trial judge’s
    decision was unreasonable, we disagree.  In comprehensive reasons, the trial judge found that the evidence
    demonstrated that the appellant is in the very highest risk classification to
    re-offend violently in relationships with women.  He also found that there was no reasonable
    possibility of eventual control of risk in the community.  He declared that the appellant was a
    dangerous offender and sentenced him to a mandatory sentence of indeterminate
    imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the trial judge gave meaningful and proper
    consideration to all of the evidence and his conclusion is well supported by
    the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is dismissed.</p>
