    appellant argues that the trial judge misapprehended the appellant’s evidence
    when in the trial judge’s reasons he indicated that the appellant did not
    testify that he asked the complainant if she was “okay” with the sexual activity
    at any stage while that activity was going on.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge accurately summarized the appellant’s evidence during his examination-in-chief.  The
    appellant testified that no such question had been put to him by the complainant.  In
    cross-examination, the appellant gave different answers to what was essentially
    the same question.  At one stage in his cross-examination, he repeated what
    he had said during examination-in-chief.  On two occasions in cross-examination,
    he indicated that he had in fact asked the complainant whether she was “okay” and
    that she had not given any response.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not agree that the trial judge’s reasons demonstrate any misapprehension
    of this part of the evidence.  At most, it could be said that the trial judge
    did not separately articulate each and every response given by the appellant
    in the course of his evidence to what was essentially the same question.  The
    trial judge’s failure to recite all of the various answers given by the appellant
    was, in our view, of no moment. The trial judge’s review of the evidence
    on this issue was significant for two reasons.  First, it demonstrated that
    the appellant’s evidence as to the complainant’s reaction during the activity
    was very different in his evidence than it had been in the two statements
    he gave to the police.  In the statements, he indicated that the complainant
    was a willing and enthusiastic participant in the event.  In his evidence,
    the appellant portrayed the complainant as someone who was initially willing
    but by the end of the events had come very much to regret what was going
    on.  Second, parts of the cross-examination not referred to by the trial
    judge hardly assisted the appellant.  At their highest, they suggested a
    callous disregard for the complainant during the sexual activity.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also argued that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence of
    the co-accused.  The co-accused was tried separately and was called as a
    witness at the appellant’s trial by the Crown.  We were referred to one misstatement
    of fact by the trial judge.  The trial judge indicated that the co-accused’s
    evidence differed from the appellant’s in that the co-accused testified that
    he had removed the complainant’s pants whereas the appellant testified that
    it was the appellant who did so.  In fact, both testified that the appellant
    had removed the pants and the trial judge misstated this part of the co-accused’s
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    misstatement was, in our view, minor.  Indeed, it was clearly irrelevant
    to the trial judge’s overall analysis of the evidence and her credibility
    assessment.  Certainly, the error does not come close to the kind of material
    misapprehension of the evidence that would warrant appellate intervention
    within the trial judge’s findings of fact.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    other arguments were advanced on behalf of the appellant in counsel’s factum.  Counsel
    did not present oral argument on those issues.  We have considered them and
    are satisfied that there is no merit to them.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
