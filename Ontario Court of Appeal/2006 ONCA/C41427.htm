      a Saturday night in November 2002, a man driving a stolen Chrysler Intrepid
      ran into a van at an Ontario Provincial Police RIDE program checkpoint
      in Peterborough. Constable Blackman rushed over to the Intrepid and opened
      the driver’s door. He was hit by the door, and then dragged along by the
      car as it reversed. He fell and the car drove over his leg.</span></p>

      because of the lost evidence (the two cars). The trial judge dismissed
      the motion. The jury found the appellant guilty on all six counts. The

      to the fourteen and a half months of pre-trial custody that he had already

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1. The trial judge erred in refusing to grant a
    stay of proceedings because of the lost evidence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2. The trial judge erred in instructing the jury
    on how to evaluate Constable Blackman’s eyewitness identification.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3. The Crown’s closing jury address was improper.</p>
  <p>The appellant also submitted that his sentence, which effectively amounted
    to five years’ imprisonment, was excessive. I would dismiss both the conviction
    appeal and the sentence appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>B. OVERVIEW OF THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>a. Theft of the Chrysler Intrepid</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      Saturday morning, November 16, 2002, Terry Huffman, a retired teacher,
      left his car running outside Tim Horton’s in Peterborough. The car was
      stolen. Mr. Huffman reported the theft to the police. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>b. The RIDE Program</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>That
      evening, the O.P.P. set up a RIDE (Reduce Impaired Drivers Everywhere)
      program on the ramp of the Peterborough bypass leading to Highway 7 eastbound.
      The area was well lit. The weather was cold and windy. At the RIDE stop
      were four unmarked police cars, each with its emergency rear lights on.
      One of the police cars belonged to Constable Blackman.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      police were stopping all cars. Just after 10 p.m. a Dodge Caravan approached
      the RIDE stop, followed by a Chrysler Intrepid. The van stopped, and another
      officer went to deal with the driver. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Constable
      Blackman went to direct the Intrepid. He was wearing an orange reflective
      vest with the word “Police” on its front and back. As the Intrepid approached
      the RIDE checkpoint, it slowed to 10 to 15 kilometres per hour. But it
      did not stop. Constable Blackman yelled, “Stop” but the Intrepid drove
      into the back of the van.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Because
      of the driver’s dazed appearance and his conduct, Constable Blackman thought
      he might be alcohol-impaired. He rushed over to the Intrepid, opened the
      driver’s door, and was immediately hit by the door as the car reversed.
      Constable Blackman tried to hang onto the door but he lost his footing.
      As he hit the ground, the Intrepid drove over his left leg, and he fell
      into the ditch. The Intrepid accelerated down the ramp, going backwards
      to the west on the eastbound ramp. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>c. Constable Blackman’s identification
      of the appellant</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Constable
      Blackman estimated that the entire incident – from the time he first saw
      the driver until he lost his balance and fell into the ditch – took ten
      seconds. He testified that when the Intrepid came about five metres away
      from him, the overhead lighting allowed him to see into the car and he
      got a “good look” at the driver. He got a second look at the driver when
      he opened the door and the interior light came on. As the car moved backwards,
      he and the driver were looking directly at each other. Constable Blackman
      noticed that the driver was wearing jeans. When arrested later that night,
      the appellant was wearing faded tan green pants made of a jean material.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although
      Constable Blackman did not know the appellant before the incident, he testified
      that his memories of what occurred were very good, and that he had no doubt
      the appellant was the driver of the Intrepid.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>d. The police chase</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Two
      other officers pursued the Intrepid right away with lights and sirens on.
      A few minutes later, Constable Blackman joined the chase. One of the other
      officers got the licence plate number of the car, which matched that of
      Mr. Huffman’s stolen Chrysler Intrepid. Constable Blackman radioed in a
      description of the driver.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      cars reached speeds of 150 to 160 kilometres an hour on Highway 115. The
      Intrepid was being driven erratically. When the chase went south, road
      conditions worsened as the weather turned into a combination of snow, rain
      and freezing rain.  The car speeds eventually dropped to about 80 kilometres
      an hour. Constable Blackman overtook the Intrepid to attempt a “rolling
      block.” However, the Intrepid drove into the left rear corner of Constable
      Blackman’s cruiser so powerfully that the cruiser spun around and eventually
      skidded into the ditch. After hitting Constable Blackman’s car, the driver
      of the Intrepid accelerated to 180 kilometres an hour and turned off the
      car lights. The police immediately terminated the chase as it had become
      too dangerous. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>e. The appellant’s arrest</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Seven
      minutes later, near where the police stopped their chase, they found the
      Intrepid facing the wrong way in a ditch. No one was in or around the car. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>About
      ten minutes later, in a farm field about 300 metres away from where the
      Intrepid was found in a ditch, two officers saw a man, who turned out to
      be the appellant, peeking out from behind a garage. When one of the officers
      yelled “Stop, police”, the appellant started running. Within a few minutes,
      the two officers caught up with the appellant and arrested him. No one
      else was in the vicinity. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      appellant was placed in a police cruiser. Constable Blackman went over
      to the cruiser and smelled a strong odour of marijuana. The appellant appeared
      to be under the influence of a drug. Constable Blackman said to him, “I’m
      the officer you ran over in Peterborough.”
    The appellant replied, “I don’t know what you’re talking about. I seen all
    the cop cars around so I ran because of the drugs.” The police seized eight
    grams of marijuana from the appellant.</span></p>

      the appellant was fingerprinted, the Intrepid was not tested for fingerprints.
      Constable Blackman testified that fingerprinting the Intrepid would have
      been redundant because he was satisfied that the appellant was the driver.
      He said that he would have fingerprinted the car had he not been one hundred
      per cent sure of his identification.</span></p>

      morning after the incident, Constable Blackman was told that the Intrepid
      had been towed to a towing compound. He never went to look at the car.
      Two days later, however, Mr. Huffman went to retrieve his personal items
      from the car. By then, the Intrepid was at an Oshawa auto-wrecker’s yard.
      Mr. Huffman noticed a number of items in the car that did not belong to
      him or to his family. Eventually, the Intrepid was destroyed.</span></p>

      photographs of Constable Blackman’s police cruiser were entered into evidence.
      Some of the photographs showed damage to the cruiser. However, the cruiser
      itself was never forensically examined and, by the time of trial, it had
      been repaired and replaced.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>C. CONVICTION APPEAL</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>First Issue: Did the trial

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>     The
      appellant submits that the trial judge should have stayed the charges against
      him because two pieces of evidence, potentially useful to the defence,
      were destroyed or lost. One piece of evidence was the stolen Intrepid,
      which was destroyed by the auto-wreckers before it was forensically tested
      for fingerprints or other evidence that may have pointed to the identity
      of the driver. The other piece of evidence was Constable Blackman’s police
      cruiser, which was repaired and replaced before being examined for damage.
      The trial record is silent on when the Intrepid was destroyed, and on when
      the police cruiser was replaced.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>     The
      appellant brought a motion for a stay at the beginning of the trial, and
      the trial judge ruled on the motion immediately. He dismissed it. He concluded
      that the defence had not diligently pursued disclosure of the evidence
      concerning the cars; indeed, it had not sought to examine either car until
      after the first trial ended. The trial judge also concluded that the missing
      evidence did not prejudice the accused and therefore did not impair his
      right to make full answer and defence:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, in this case, the police did not destroy
    or lose the applicant’s vehicle<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a>.
    Mr. Knox was in a position from day one, in November of 2002, to have the
    inspection performed. This is his Application and his onus. Only now, at
    the start of the second trial, assisted with the same counsel as at trial
    number one does he first bring an Application for a stay. Only now, after
    trial number one is completed and a hung jury resulted on the same issue
    of identification, that I am told by defence counsel that it is asserted
    by a defence at this trial was this Application be brought. There is no admissible
    evidence, I hold, as to what happened to the Chrysler Intrepid vehicle and
    no evidence as to when it was dismantled. The police and the Crown are not
    entitled to guess at which evidence may be relevant to the defence. The Crown
    must err on the side of inclusion but need not produce clearly irrelevant
    evidence. Here, counsel remained passive on the issue for tactical reasons
    and did not, I find, exercise reasonable diligence in pursuing disclosure.
    At no time until almost one year later after the hung jury trial ended did
    Mr. Knox first seek the disclosure and bring the potential relevance of this
    evidence to the attention of, first the Crown, and now the court. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>No prejudice to the accused, I find, has been established.
    There is no air of reality to the assertion now made by counsel for the accused

    result in the impairment of his right to make full answer and defence. The

      substance. The Crown has fairly conceded that the police’s failure to preserve
      the cars for the defence’s examination breached the appellant’s constitutional
      right to make full answer and defence. I accept that concession. Thus,
      the trial judge erred in holding that the accused’s right to make full

      116 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at 107 (S.C.C.). The Crown had an obligation to disclose
      all relevant evidence in its possession to the defence. Where the Crown
      has an obligation to disclose evidence to the defence, it has an obligation
      to preserve that evidence. If the evidence is later lost because of the
      Crown’s “unacceptable negligence”, or the Crown cannot satisfactorily explain
      why the evidence was not preserved, then the Crown has breached its disclosure
      obligation; and correspondingly, it has breached the accused’s constitutional
      right under s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> to make full answer and defence. </span></p>

      cases may arise where, to paraphrase the words of Doherty J.A. in <i>Bero</i>, <i>supra</i> at
      para. 29, the defence’s failure to pursue disclosure with reasonable diligence
      may weigh against a claim that the Crown’s failure to preserve evidence
      resulted in a breach of an accused’s <i>Charter</i> rights. In this case,
      however, as I have said, the Crown has conceded a s. 7 breach. The lost
      cars, especially the Intrepid, were relevant and potentially useful to
      the defence. Sopinka J. commented in <i>La</i>, <i>supra</i> at 107, that, “as
      the relevance of the evidence increases, so does the degree of care for
      its preservation that is expected of the police.” Here, the evidence was
      highly relevant</span></p>

      Crown and its agents, therefore, were obliged to take reasonable steps
      to preserve the cars for a reasonable time and to make them available for
      the defence’s examination. At a minimum, before permitting the Intrepid
      to be destroyed and the police cruiser to be repaired, the Crown had an
      obligation to so notify the defence. The Crown breached these obligations
      and its explanation for doing so was unsatisfactory. Constable Blackman
      did not try to preserve the evidence because he was “one hundred percent” certain
      that the appellant was the driver. In his mind, testing the Intrepid was
      unnecessary. The Constable’s explanation, unfortunately, not only reflects
      tunnel vision, but as well, a failure to appreciate the Crown’s disclosure
      obligation under <i>R. v.</i> <i>Stinchcombe</i> <i>(No. 1),</i> [1991]

      was an abuse of process. Quite properly, the appellant has not suggested
      that the Crown deliberately permitted the destruction of the evidence.
      However, the Crown has not given a satisfactory explanation for its failure
      to take reasonable steps to preserve the evidence. Contrary to the ruling
      of the trial judge, the appellant has established a breach of his s. 7

      on this ground of appeal, the crucial question is the appropriate remedy
      under s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>. The appellant does not ask for a
      new trial; he asks for a stay. A stay, of course, is rarely granted because
      of the societal interest in a verdict on the merits. To warrant a stay,
      the appellant must meet the “clearest of cases”
    standard. Ordinarily a stay because of the Crown’s failure to disclose relevant
    evidence is justified only if the non-disclosure either irreparably prejudiced
    the accused’s ability to make full answer and defence or irreparably harmed
    the integrity of the administration of justice. See <i>R. v. Dulude</i> (2004),

      this case, the integrity of the justice system has not been irreparably
      harmed. The Crown did not intentionally permit the cars to be destroyed,
      and nothing in the record suggests that Constable Blackman’s explanation
      reflected a “systemic disregard for the prosecution’s obligation to preserve
      relevant evidence.” See <i>Bero</i>, <i>supra</i> at para. 45.</span></p>

      in my view, did the destruction of the evidence irreparably prejudice the
      appellant’s ability to defend himself. I say that for two reasons. First,
      as the trial judge pointed out, the appellant did not act with reasonable
      diligence in seeking to examine the cars. Quite the opposite. He appears
      to have made a deliberate decision at his first trial not to examine either
      car. Second, defence counsel’s cross-examination on the lost evidence,
      her closing comments to the jury and the trial judge’s instruction to the
      jury went a long way towards offsetting any prejudice to the defence flowing
      from the Crown’s failure to preserve the evidence.</span></p>

      appellant did not ask to examine either of the lost cars until nearly a
      year after the incident leading to his arrest. Yet the appellant retained
      counsel the night of the incident, November 16, 2002, and that counsel
      has acted for him throughout both trials. Thus, the appellant knew from
      the beginning that forensic testing of the Intrepid might shed light on
      the identity of the driver on the night in question. But he did not ask
      to examine the car until after the first trial had ended in a hung jury.
      Instead, during the first trial, the appellant apparently decided not to
      raise the issue of the lost evidence. In her submission on the stay application,
      the appellant’s counsel seemed to concede that the decision was deliberate:</span></p>

      might reasonably infer that the appellant did not really want to examine
      the Intrepid. He preferred to be able to say to the jury that, because
      it was missing and had not been tested for fingerprints, the Crown could
      not prove the identity of the driver beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      defence then changed strategy. In October 2003, after the first trial had
      ended, and eleven months after the incident, the appellant asked to examine
      the cars. By then, the Intrepid had been destroyed, although, as I have
      said, the date that happened is not disclosed in the record. By then, as
      well, Blackman’s police cruiser had been repaired and replaced. </span></p>

      seems to me that the trial judge was correct in finding that the defence
      had not exercised reasonable diligence and had not done so for tactical
      reasons. A tactical decision not to seek disclosure will generally make
      a court unsympathetic to a plea that the Crown’s failure to disclose caused
      irreparable prejudice. Here, the defence’s lack of diligence and its tactics
      refute any notion that the Crown’s failure to preserve the evidence irreparably
      prejudiced the accused. See <i>R. v. Dixon</i> (1998), 122 C.C.C. (3d)
      1 at paras. 37-39 (S.C.C.). The appellant must shoulder the consequences
      of his own conduct. As Ms. Wheeler fairly pointed out, to grant a stay

      the accused was charged with dangerous driving. Soon after the accident,
      the Crown decided it no longer needed the car involved in the incident
      for its purposes and allowed it to be destroyed. As in this case, the principal
      issue at trial was the identity of the driver. The lost car had been photographed
      but never tested for fingerprints. Unlike this case, in <i>Bero</i> the
      defence had pursued disclosure with reasonable diligence and the Crown’s
      conduct amounted to an abuse of process. Nonetheless, this court refused
      a stay. Doherty J.A., writing for the panel, concluded that a new trial
      at which the defence could raise the effect of the lost evidence was an
      adequate remedy. If a stay was not an appropriate remedy in <i>Bero</i>,

      a stay was not needed in this case because the trial judge’s conduct of

      testing of the Intrepid might have shown is not known. Fingerprinting may
      well have been inculpatory, not exculpatory. This much the defence conceded.
      Therefore, this was not a case where one could say that forensic testing
      would likely have led to an acquittal. We simply do not know where, if
      anywhere, it would have led.</span></p>

      before the jury as favourable a gloss as he could on the missing evidence.
      His counsel was permitted to cross-examine the police officers on their
      failure to preserve the evidence. In her closing jury address, she encouraged
      the jury to conclude that the police’s failure to test the Intrepid for
      fingerprints raised a reasonable doubt on the issue of identification. </span></p>

      the trial judge instructed the jury that in weighing the evidence, and
      deciding whether the Crown had proved its case, the jury was entitled to
      consider the effect of the lost evidence and Constable Blackman’s explanation
      for not preserving that evidence:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If you find that the defence inability to fingerprint
    the car has, in fact, been lost or the defence ability has been lost and
    that the explanation for that unavailability is inadequate, you may find
    that this evidence would not support the case for the Crown. The effect of
    the unavailability of this evidence may have on the obligation of Crown counsel
    to prove the case against Mr. Knox beyond a reasonable doubt will be for
    the 11 of you to say. Officer Blackman told the court emphatically that he
    was a hundred percent sure that Kevin Knox was the driver of the Intrepid
    vehicle throughout and that it would have been redundant to subject the vehicle
    to a full fingerprint examination. He saw no reason to photograph. </p>

      recommended by Doherty J.A. in <i>Bero</i> at para. 67:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where the failure to preserve evidence results
    in a breach of an accused’s s. 7 rights and where the defence has exercised
    reasonable diligence in attempting to preserve the evidence. I think the
    trial judge should also instruct the jury that the Crown was under an obligation
    to preserve the evidence, and failed to do so, and that the defence cannot
    be faulted for not gaining access to the evidence before it was destroyed. </p>

      as I have said, in <i>Bero</i> the defence had acted with reasonable diligence.
      Therefore, Doherty J.A.’s recommended instruction included both reference
      to the Crown’s obligation to preserve the evidence and the caution “the
      defence cannot be faulted for not gaining access to the evidence before
      it was destroyed.” Here, the trial judge could not tell the jury that the
      defence could not be faulted for failing to examine the cars. And if he
      had told the jury about the Crown’s obligation to preserve the evidence,
      he also would have been obliged to tell the jury about the defence’s failure
      to act diligently in seeking to examine this evidence. Not surprisingly,
      the defence did not object to the trial judge’s charge on the lost evidence.
      I expect the defence, like myself, considered that a reasonably intelligent
      jury could properly assess for itself the police officer’s self-serving

      s. 4(6) of the <i>Canada Evidence Act, </i>R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5; and the
      Crown improperly referred to the appellant’s failure to give a statement

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant did not testify. Section 4(6) of the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i> precludes
      a Crown from commenting on an accused’s failure to testify. Crown counsel
      appeared to run afoul of this statutory prohibition. In the course of telling
      the jurors that even if they rejected Constable Blackman’s identification
      evidence, they could still convict on the  circumstantial evidence of the
      appellant’s arrest, he said:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><br>
    The first question is why is Kevin Knox in this field at eleven o’clock at
    night on this lousy November evening alone? Ladies and gentlemen, this is
    where the issue of inferences versus wild speculation has to come into play.
    Well, let’s look at the evidence first and we’ll talk about that. Kevin Knox
    told Gary Blackman that at that time he was living at the Brock Mission on
    Brock Street, just right here in this neighbourhood, okay, yet here he is,
    eleven o’clock at night, he’s in this field by himself and not only is he
    in this field, but he just happens to be there at the same time within a
    few hundred metres of the place where this car is ditched. What a coincidence.
    Now, you might be thinking, “well, gee, how do I know somebody wasn’t around
    or how do I know a bus didn’t stop and pick up the real driver or how do
    I know this.”
    Ladies and gentlemen, any reasonable doubt you have has to be based on the
    evidence. You’re not allowed to wonder about buses or helicopters or whether
    he had a house down there. There’s no evidence on it.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><u>Obviously, Mr. Knox has a constitutional right
      not to testify. He has to prove nothing here. The onus is on the Crown
      the whole time, but having said that, if he chooses not to testify, then
      the Crown’s case stands or falls on its own two feet</u>. That is to say,
      you’re not entitled to speculate. You’re not entitled to speculate on things
      which would help convict Mr. Knox, but you’re also not allowed to speculate
      about things that would help acquit him.  A reasonable doubt has to be  based
      on the evidence, so what I mean by that is if we took an example of where
      somebody –
    let’s say someone hit a pedestrian in a car and they call evidence and they
    end the case and the defence were to pop up and say, ‘well, Your Honour,
    you can’t convict because we don’t know. Maybe, a deer ran out in front of
    the driver and maybe that’s what caused the accident.’ The law is clear that
    you can’t do that. The Crown is not – see it’s impossible for the Crown to
    disprove negatives. I don’t have to disprove beyond a reasonable doubt every
    possibility that could have happened because <u>while the defence doesn’t
    have to call evidence, it’s entitled to</u> [emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge ruled that the Crown’s remarks did not breach s. 4(6):</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It was strictly and exclusively a comment dealing
    with the Crown’s urging the jury to deal  not with speculation, but with
    evidence. It did not seek to turn the accused’s silence against him, nor
    did it breach the real purpose of s. 4(6) which I articulated earlier from <i>Potvin
    and the Queen</i>. That is that it
    “was enacted for the protection of an accused against the danger of having
    his right to testify presented to the jury in such a fashion as to suggest
    his silence is being used as a cloak for his guilt.” There was no such suggestion
    made by the Crown in the context that the Crown made the utterance that it
    did.</p>
  <p>The trial judge did not instruct the jury on the Crown’s comments about
    the appellant’s right not to testify.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      agree with the trial judge’s ruling. Although stated in absolute terms,
      the prohibition in s. 4(6) has been interpreted in the light of its purpose
      - to preclude a Crown from suggesting to the jury that an accused’s silence
      can be used as evidence of guilt. Although close to the line, the Crown’s
      remarks did not go so far as to suggest this impermissible use. These remarks
      certainly would have been better left unsaid, but they did not encourage
      the jury to use the accused’s failure to testify as a “cloak for his guilt.” See <i>R.
      v. Potvin</i> (1989), 47 C.C.C. (3d) 289 at 312-313 (S.C.C.).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      her closing, defence counsel argued that the police’s failure to show what
      had happened to the Intrepid between the time it was stolen in the morning
      and crashed into the RIDE program in the evening, should raise a reasonable
      doubt about the appellant’s guilt on the charge of possession of stolen
      property. The Crown responded to this argument by referring to the appellant’s
      failure to give a statement to the police:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Count number six, possession of property obtained
    by crime. As I said, Mr. Knox was not charged with stealing this car and,
    obviously, Mr. Knox had a constitutional right not to give a statement so,
    obviously, even if the police had been interested in finding who actually
    stole it, they had no basis to go on. They couldn’t force Mr. Knox to cooperate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Again,
      these remarks would have been better left unsaid. However, the trial judge
      eliminated any concern that the jury might improperly rely on the accused’s
      silence by his instruction to the jury. He cautioned them:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>You are not, in any way, to infer any guilt for
    Mr. Knox’s electing not to speak further to police than that, that he did,
    in the Durham police car that evening and again to Officer Blackman on Blackman’s
    evidence back at the Peterborough Police Station. There was no onus or duty
    on Mr. Knox to do so and you will not infer guilt or draw any adverse inference
    against Mr. Knox as a result of anything which he did not say to police on
    being questioned by Officer Blackman. </p>

      appellant raised other grounds of appeal. In the panel’s view, none had
      enough merit to warrant calling on the Crown. I will, however, deal with
      them very briefly.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(i) Denial of bail and change
      of venue</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      trial, the appellant sought bail for the purpose of bringing a change of
      venue motion. The trial judge denied bail. No change of venue motion was
      ever filed. On appeal, the appellant challenged the trial judge’s bail
      ruling. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      record amply supported the denial of bail. Flight from the police was at
      the heart of the appellant’s alleged conduct. Moreover, the appellant has
      a lengthy criminal record, including several convictions for failing to
      comply with a recognizance. He was on probation at the time the offences
      occurred, and in the past had violated the terms of a statutory release.
      He simply did not meet the criteria for bail.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(ii) Instruction on specific
      offences</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      aspects of the evidence</span></h4>

      evidence.</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant sought to file as fresh evidence a newspaper article that appeared
      in the local paper on the morning the trial judge completed his charge
      and the case went to the jury. The Crown consented to the admission of
      the fresh evidence because it was potentially relevant to the validity
      of the trial process.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      article did not affect the fairness of the appellant’s trial. It was a
      fair summary of the evidence that was before the jury. The trial judge
      had already instructed the jury to ignore media reports. And, most telling
      of all, the defence did not even raise before the trial judge the article’s
      potential to affect the fairness of the trial. </span></p>

      appellant had served fourteen and a half months’ pre-trial custody. At
      trial, the Crown submitted that the appellant should serve an additional
      two to four years, but argued for the upper end of that range. The defence
      argued for a sentence of time served, or for a very short period in addition
      to time served. The trial judge held that a sentence of five years was
      appropriate. He gave the appellant two for one credit for the fourteen
      and a half months he had spent in pre-trial custody (twenty-nine months).
      He therefore sentenced the appellant to thirty-one months’ imprisonment.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      appellant is an Aboriginal, and had lived on a Blackfoot reserve for a
      considerable period of time. Although unfortunately, no pre-sentence report
      was filed, and thus no material on the appellant’s upbringing was before
      the court, the trial judge did take into account the appellant’s aboriginal
      status.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>What
      mainly supports the sentence is the appellant’s lengthy criminal record
      and the need to deter and denounce this kind of conduct toward the police.
      The appellant had over thirty previous convictions. He was forty-two years
      of age when he was sentenced, and apart from a gap between 1980 and 1986,
      he had continuously been in trouble with the law. Nothing on the record
      explains his persistent criminality.</span></p>
