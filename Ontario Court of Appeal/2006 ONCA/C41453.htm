    appellant appeals against conviction and sentence. She was convicted of fraud
    over $5,000 on the CIBC between August 17 and September 20, 2001, and of
    uttering a forged driver’s licence on August 17, 2001.</p>

    counsel raised two specific legal issues: (1) the failure of the trial judge
    to address the frailty of the eyewitness identification; and (2) the reliance
    by the trial judge on a handwriting comparison without the assistance of
    expert evidence. The appellant also pointed out certain features of the evidence
    on her own behalf. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    The trial judge was alive to the fact that the eyewitness evidence had some
    inconsistencies. He found that on that evidence alone there was a reasonable
    doubt  about the identity of the person who opened the account on August
    17, 2001.  However, he then turned to the other evidence, in particular the
    fact that the appellant was arrested with several identification documents
    of Daisy Reid including the same false driver’s licence that the person who
    presented herself as Daisy Reid on August 17 used.  The trial judge rejected
    as totally incredible the appellant’s explanation for possession of the identification.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(2)
    The trial judge was entitled to compare the appellant’s signature as Daisy
    Reid on the amendment to the cheque on September 28, 2001 to other signatures
    of Daisy Reid on other documents presented to the bank without expert handwriting
    evidence. Although it would have been preferable for him to explicitly caution
    himself about the care to be taken when making such comparisons unassisted,
    his conclusion that the handwriting was done by the same person was a reasonable
    one. It was not reversible error for him to use the hand-writing comparison
    as one piece of evidence that, taken together with all of the other evidence,
    satisfied him beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant who came to the
    bank to negotiate a cheque on September 28, 2001 was the same person who
    opened the account on August 17, 2001 and who came to the branch to sign
    the indemnity agreement for the allegedly lost $25,000 bank draft. As only
    $500 was deposited on August 17 into the account and all the other money
    in the account came from the CIBC, the indemnity agreement links the appellant
    to knowledge of the fraud on the CIBC, even though the evidence was that
    only men came in to withdraw funds up to September 20, 2001.  As the trial
    judge found, the appellant was at least a party to the fraud.</p>

    appellant also appeals the sentence of four months conditional with two years
    probation. She wanted a conditional discharge in order to be able to travel
    to the United States. The trial judge rejected that request and adverted
    to the public interest in imposing a sentence that includes a criminal record.
    There is no basis for this court to interfere with that disposition. </p>
