      Justice D.J. Gordon of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>MOLDAVER J.A.:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Pamela Bonn was
    murdered on the night of May 23, 1995. Within a week of her death, the appellant
    was arrested and charged with second-degree murder. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      On December 6,
    2003, some eight and one-half years later, the appellant was found guilty
    as charged following his trial before the Honourable Mr. Justice D.J. Gordon
    and a jury. The lengthy delay is explained by the fact that this was the
    appellant’s third trial. At his first trial, the jury could not agree and
    a mistrial was declared; at his second trial, the jury found him guilty as
    charged but on appeal, this court set aside the conviction and ordered a
    new trial. Hence, the third trial and the ensuing conviction from which the
    appellant now appeals. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The appellant
    seeks to have his conviction set aside on the basis of three alleged errors
    at trial. Specifically, he contends that:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;'>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    trial judge erred in permitting the Crown to lead evidence of his general
    disposition for violence;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;'>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    trial judge erred in permitting the Crown to lead inadmissible opinion evidence
    from the officer in charge of the case; and</p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;'>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    trial judge erred in failing to give the jury a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning in
    respect of two witnesses who gave important evidence for the Crown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    reasons that follow, I am satisfied that there is merit in the first two
    grounds of appeal. As between the two, the second ground causes me little
    concern. Had it stood alone, I would have applied the curative proviso in
    s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> to sustain the conviction. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first ground, however, is another matter. It resulted in the wrongful admission
    of bad character evidence that portrayed the appellant as a man of violence.
    As such, it was highly prejudicial and likely to have been used by the jury
    as a basis for rejecting the appellant’s “alternate suspect” defence. (The
    appellant’s defence was that Ms. Bonn was killed by her boyfriend Jeffrey
    Hertel.)  In a case as close as this one, where the evidence going to the
    identity of Ms. Bonn’s killer was finely balanced and where the verdict could
    realistically have gone either way, there was unfortunately no room for an
    error of this nature. I say
    “unfortunately” because the trial was a difficult one and, apart from the
    one error of substance, the trial judge conducted the proceedings in an exemplary
    fashion. His charge to the jury was a model of clarity and balance and he
    made every effort to ensure that both sides received a fair trial. Ironically,
    it was in that context – ensuring fairness to the Crown – that he admitted
    the impugned bad character evidence. With respect, I believe that he erred
    in doing so and that the error does not lend itself to the application of
    the curative proviso. Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, set aside the
    conviction and order a new trial. </p>

    I have determined that there must be a new trial, I do not propose to detail
    the evidence except where necessary to flesh out a particular ground of appeal.
    The salient facts will become apparent as I review the positions of the parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pamela
    Bonn was beaten to death sometime between the hours of 9:00 p.m. on Tuesday,
    May&nbsp;23 and 2:00 a.m. on Wednesday May 24, 1995. She was killed in apartment
    13 at 105 Mausser Avenue in the City of Kitchener. That was the appellant’s
    apartment and it is where he lived in the several months leading up to the
    homicide.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Bonn’s body was found in Mausser Park on Thursday, May 25. The park is located
    a short distance from the appellant’s apartment building. In the early morning
    hours of May 25, several witnesses observed a man pushing a recycling bin
    to and from the direction of the park. After the appellant’s arrest on May
    26, a recycling bin belonging to his apartment building was searched and
    various items containing his fingerprints were found in it. The Crown took
    the position at trial that the appellant was the man seen pushing the bin
    and that he used it to transport Ms. Bonn’s body from his apartment to the
    park where she was eventually found.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    no one disputed that Ms. Bonn was killed in the appellant’s apartment, the
    appellant claimed that he was not at his apartment on the night of the murder.
    He testified instead that earlier that evening, he turned his apartment over
    to a prospective new tenant by the name of Lou De Paepe. He did so because
    he was in the process of being evicted and De Paepe mentioned that he would
    be interested in taking over the unit. As a result, De Paepe made arrangements
    to meet with the appellant’s landlady later that evening and the appellant
    decided to leave to avoid a confrontation with her. According to the appellant,
    he spent the night of May 23 and the following night at 78 Waterloo Street
    with some friends and he did not return to his apartment until the morning
    of Thursday, May 25. Hence, he denied having anything to do with Ms.&nbsp;Bonn’s
    murder. Indeed, he claimed that as of May 23, he did not even know Ms. Bonn. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    same could not be said for Jeffrey Hertel. He was Ms Bonn’s boyfriend in
    the year or so preceding her death and there was evidence that their relationship
    was a stormy one and that he regularly threatened and beat her. As such,
    he was the one who had a motive to kill Ms. Bonn, not the appellant. In the
    several weeks before her death, Ms.&nbsp;Bonn confided to some of her friends
    that she was afraid of Hertel and that he had threatened to kill her once
    he was released from prison. On the day of her murder, she told a friend
    that Hertel (who by now was out of prison) was “after her” and she asked
    her friend not to disclose her whereabouts to him. In the same conversation,
    she told her friend that she was on her way to see the appellant at his apartment
    on Mausser Avenue. (As will be seen, despite the appellant’s evidence to
    the contrary, five Crown witnesses testified that the appellant did know
    Ms. Bonn.)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    indicated, it was the appellant’s position that Ms. Bonn was killed by Hertel.
    In addition to evidence of motive, he also relied on the fact that De Paepe
    and Hertel were close friends and that he had left De Paepe alone in his
    apartment on the night of Ms.&nbsp;Bonn’s murder. Further support for his
    position came from a witness who observed two men in the early morning hours
    of Thursday, May 25, “carrying something heavy wrapped in a blanket” on a
    path leading to the park where Ms. Bonn’s body was discovered later that
    day. That, of course, fit with the appellant’s position that Hertel had killed
    Ms. Bonn, either alone or in the company of the De Paepe, and that De Paepe
    had assisted him in disposing of the body and then removing from the apartment
    any evidence that might link them to the scene.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant gained added support for his position from several witnesses who
    overheard Hertel saying that he [Hertel] had killed Ms. Bonn and that the
    police had “got the wrong guy”. Hertel’s attempt to set up a false alibi
    for the night of the murder and his “disappearance” for two weeks after the
    event provided the appellant with further evidence implicating Hertel as
    the killer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    sum, without wishing to overstate the appellant’s case, there was a credible
    body of evidence that pointed towards Hertel (and away from the appellant)
    as the person responsible for killing Ms. Bonn. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    acknowledged the legitimacy of the appellant’s
    “alternate suspect” defence, the strength of the Crown’s case against him
    must also be considered. In that regard, while the case for the Crown was
    not overwhelming, it was potentially quite strong depending on the jury’s
    assessment of certain of the Crown witnesses. (I include Hertel in this category
    even though he was called by the defence.)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    way of example, five Crown witnesses testified that the appellant knew Ms.&nbsp;Bonn.
    Some gave evidence from which it could be inferred that she and the appellant
    were involved in a relationship at the time of her death. Other evidence
    suggested that they may have been planning to live together. That body of
    evidence stood in stark contrast to the appellant’s assertion that he did
    not know Ms. Bonn. A finding against him on that issue would have been highly
    damaging to his position.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several
    other examples come to mind. De Paepe and Hertel testified and denied having
    anything to do with Ms. Bonn’s death. De Paepe insisted that he had never
    been at the appellant’s apartment on Mausser Avenue. If believed, their evidence
    effectively nullified the appellant’s “alternate suspect” defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another
    example comes from the evidence of Police Constable Vicki MacDonald. She
    spoke to the appellant at his apartment on the morning of Thursday, May 25,
    in the course of investigating an incident, reported earlier that morning,
    of a man wheeling a recycling bin to and from the direction of Mausser Park.
    According to the officer, when she asked the appellant whether he had been
    walking with the bin that morning, he replied “no, I just got up”. The appellant
    denied saying those words. He claimed, instead, that he replied “no, I just
    got back”. It was his evidence that he had returned to his apartment that
    morning to retrieve some medication. That of course, coincided with his position
    that he had not slept at his apartment on either Tuesday night or Wednesday
    night of that week, the time frame within which Ms. Bonn was killed. The
    officer’s evidence of the conversation belied the appellant’s version. If
    accepted, it severely weakened his defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    final example comes from the forensic evidence located at the appellant’s
    apartment and on the body of Ms. Bonn. Of particular note, the appellant’s
    DNA was located on a pink, white and grey ladies’ shirt that almost certainly
    belonged to Ms. Bonn. The shirt was found on the kitchen table of the appellant’s
    apartment. A further “partial incomplete” DNA profile was obtained from a
    saliva deposit located on Ms. Bonn’s left nipple. Although consistent with
    the appellant’s profile, a determinative match could not be made due to the
    minimal amount of DNA obtainable from the sample. Another item located at
    the scene was a pair of men’s underwear. On examination, they revealed blood
    from Ms. Bonn and DNA from the appellant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other
    items that tended to link the appellant to the murder were found in the apartment
    and in the recycling bin belonging to the apartment, as well as on Ms. Bonn’s
    body.  The Crown of course relied on these items to identify the appellant
    as Ms Bonn’s killer. Although not determinative, they were problematic for
    the appellant, especially since there was virtually no forensic evidence
    linking De Paepe or Hertel to the scene.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    examples that I have used to demonstrate the strength of the Crown’s case
    are not exhaustive. They simply illustrate that the case against the appellant,
    though not overwhelming, was potentially quite strong depending on the jury’s
    assessment of the forensic evidence and the evidence of certain of the Crown
    witnesses and Hertel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    sum, this was a case with a lot of twists and turns. Many of the critical
    witnesses for both sides came from difficult and troubled backgrounds and
    their credibility and reliability were very much matters for the jury. The
    case was uniquely suited for a jury but given the conflicting evidence as
    to the identity of Ms. Bonn’s killer, there was little room for error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is against that backdrop that I turn to the grounds of appeal.</p>

line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    indicated, the appellant defended the charge on the basis that he did not
    kill Ms. Bonn; rather, she was murdered by Jeffrey Hertel. That defence,
    commonly referred to as the “alternate suspect” defence, was certainly available
    to the appellant on the evidence that implicated Hertel as Ms. Bonn’s killer.
    That being so, in order to convict the appellant, the jury initially had
    to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Hertel did not kill Ms. Bonn.
    If they believed or had a reasonable doubt that he did, then the appellant
    was entitled to be acquitted. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    reality, as Mr. Campbell for the appellant submitted, the outcome of the
    case hinged on the jury’s determination of that issue. If the jury was satisfied
    beyond a reasonable doubt that Hertel was not the killer, then viewed realistically,
    the appellant’s fate was sealed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    Hertel and the appellant had serious criminal records for offences involving
    drugs, dishonesty and violence. Hertel’s record contained fifty-nine convictions
    from 1975 to 2002. Most of his convictions involved crimes of dishonesty,
    while others related to violence and drugs. The appellant’s criminal record
    consisted of forty-five convictions from 1983 to 2002. Like Hertel, most
    of his convictions involved crimes of dishonesty while others related to
    violence and alcohol. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the subject of violence, apart from their criminal convictions for violence,
    both sides had witnesses who were prepared to testify to other acts and threats
    of violence committed by Hertel and the appellant against third parties.
    Unquestionably, both Hertel and the appellant were predisposed to violence
    and had the appellant chosen to do so, he could have put Hertel’s general
    disposition and propensity for violence in issue before the jury. That, however,
    is not the strategy he wished to pursue. He knew that if he did, it would
    likely open the door for the Crown to lead evidence of his general disposition
    and propensity for violence and that is something he wanted to avoid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the same time, it was essential to his defence that he be able to lead evidence
    of Hertel’s prior threats and acts of violence towards Ms. Bonn. There was
    a considerable body of such evidence and it formed one of the mainstays of
    his “alternate suspect” defence. Specifically, it showed that Hertel had
    a motive to kill Ms.&nbsp;Bonn and motive was a factor that the jury could
    consider in determining the identity of her killer. In that regard, as between
    the appellant and Hertel, the appellant came out ahead. The Crown had no
    similar evidence to offer in relation to the appellant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    is the backdrop against which defence counsel, Ms. Tuck-Jackson, sought a
    ruling from the trial judge that would have permitted her to lead evidence
    from&nbsp;Hertel of his threats and acts of violence towards Ms. Bonn but
    no one else. In other words, even though Hertel had assaulted and threatened
    other people and even though the details of those threats and assaults could
    be brought out in cross-examination, defence counsel undertook that she would
    refrain from doing so. (As indicated, Hertel was called as a defence witness

    him at large.)</p>

    approaching the matter that way, defence counsel made it clear that it was
    not her intention to show that Mr. Hertel was “the kind of person” likely
    to kill Ms.&nbsp;Bonn but that he was “in fact” the person who did so. The
    essence of her submissions are captured in the following passages from her
    argument:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>So assuming
    then that Mr. Hertel qualifies in law as an alternate suspect, <i>I am seeking
    to tender evidence of Mr.&nbsp;Hertel’s acts of violence and threats of violence
    towards only, and I want to underline triplicate, only, Pamela Bonn</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>As your Honour
    heard in the pre-trial applications, there is other evidence out there that
    Mr. Hertel has engaged in acts of violence, even similar to the manner in
    which Ms. Bonn met her untimely death. And that’s in relation to third parties.
    Your Honour may recall a gentleman by the name of Leo Gagliano in relation
    to which I filed an occurrence report. I’m not seeking to tender any of that
    evidence. <i>I am only seeking to tender evidence in relation to acts of
    violence and threats of violence relating solely to Pamela Bonn</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>THE COURT: I
    hate to interrupt. Just so I do not lose this thought. Does that mean that
    you would not be questioning Mr. Hertel about those other alleged acts?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>MS. TUCK-JACKSON:
    Most definitely, I would not.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>THE COURT: <i>And
      what does that mean if you seek to question him about his criminal record</i>?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>MS. TUCK-JACKSON:
    I … and I’ll address it with Your Honour now, as a matter of fact. If I wasn’t
    alleging that Mr.&nbsp;Hertel was an alternate suspect, as Your Honour well
    knows, I would be entitled to cross-examine Mr. Hertel on the underlying
    acts of all of his convictions. And as Your Honour knows, he does have convictions
    for violence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>I would be
      undertaking to my friend and to the court that I would not be questioning
      him about any of the convictions, the underlying acts for convictions of
      violence</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In my respectful
    submission, I would still be entitled to cross-examine him about the underlying
    acts of his convictions for dishonesty because that goes purely to the … the
    issue of credibility.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>Now my respectful
      submission, if I tender evidence of his acts of violence and threats of … of
      violence towards Ms.&nbsp;Bonn, in the context of this case, that does
      not amount to evidence of propensity</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>And it doesn’t
      amount to evidence of propensity because I am not tendering it for the
      purpose of showing that he is the kind of person who would kill Pamela
      Bonn. I am tendering it for the purpose of showing that he was the person
      who killed Pamela Bonn and, of course, the flip side of that is that I
      am tendering it for the purpose of raising a doubt that Mr.&nbsp;Vanezis
      killed Pamela Bonn</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>And that’s a
    very important distinction, in my respectful submission, because clearly
    if I was tendering it to show that he was the kind of person to kill Pamela
    Bonn, then clearly that would be propensity evidence and the decisions of
    our Court of Appeal in <i>McMillan</i> [(1975), 23 C.C.C. (2d) 160 (Ont.
    C.A.)] and <i>Scopelliti</i> [(1981), 63 C.C.C. (2d) 48, (Ont. C.A.)] tell
    us that that creates the potential for an unbalanced impression with the
    jury.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>And I entirely
      agree that if Your Honour concludes that what I’m trying to tender here
      is propensity evidence, then indeed I have opened up my client’s character
      at large and the Crown would be entitled to tender evidence in reply and … and
      I don’t mean in reply in a legal sense of the word, but … but in my respectful
      submission, this isn’t propensity evidence.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>Clearly,
      the identity of the killer in this case is a material issue and the evidence
      that I’m seeking to tender is probative of that material issue</i>. [Emphasis

      support of her position, defence counsel referred the trial judge to a
      number of authorities that drew a distinction between bad character evidence
      that was relevant to a material issue in the case and bad character evidence
      that merely showed a general propensity to engage in certain types of conduct.
      In particular, she focused on the distinction between bad character evidence
      that showed a specific propensity to do a particular criminal act and bad
      character evidence that showed a general propensity to act in a certain
      way. (See <i>R. v. S.G.G.</i> (1997), 116 C.C.C. (3d) 193 per Cory J. at
      217 (S.C.C.); <i>R. v. D.S.F.</i> (1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at 103-108

      v. MacDonald</i> (1974), 20 C.C.C. (2d) 144 at 150-153 (Ont. C.A.)). Counsel
      also referred the trial judge to the case of <i>R. v. J. C</i>., [2002]
      O.J. No. 5263 (S.C.J.) in which Archibald J., in circumstances similar
      to those in the case at hand, ruled that the defence could lead evidence
      of an alternate suspect’s motive to kill the deceased, consisting of prior
      acts of violence towards the deceased, without putting the defendant’s
      general disposition for violence into play.</span></p>

      counsel [not Ms. Klukach] balked at the approach suggested by the defence.
      In his view, while it was fine for defence counsel to undertake not to
      cross-examine Hertel on the details of his violent conduct towards third
      parties, he  [Crown counsel] wanted to be able to do so. Why? Because the
      appellant, as part of his “alternate suspect” defence, was going to rely
      on Hertel’s “confessions” to other people that he [Hertel] had killed Ms.
      Bonn. That being so, Crown counsel wanted to be able to explore Hertel’s
      entire past, including the details of his violent conduct towards third
      parties, to show that he was a disreputable character and that the jury
      should give no credence to his confessions. On that approach, Hertel’s
      general propensity for violence would be exposed to the jury. It followed,
      according to Crown counsel, that the appellant’s general propensity for
      violence should also be before the jury; otherwise, the jury would be left
      with a lop-sided view of the case. In other words, to level the playing
      field, the Crown should be permitted to lead evidence of the appellant’s
      violent conduct towards third parties. </span></p>

      a similar vein, i.e. that the jury would inevitably be exposed to Hertel’s
      general propensity for violence, Crown counsel referred to one of Hertel’s “confessions”,
      allegedly made to his ex-girlfriend Gayle Snow. According to Ms. Snow,
      in September 1996, Hertel threatened to kill her just like he had killed
      his last “old lady” Pam. Specifically, he told her that “he was going to
      rape and strangle [her] … and kill [her] and put [her] in a bin”. According
      to Crown counsel, Hertel’s threat to Ms. Snow opened the door to his general
      propensity for violence and entitled the Crown to respond in kind. Moreover,
      Crown counsel made it known that he intended to challenge Ms.&nbsp;Snow’s
      credibility on the basis that she disliked Hertel because he had regularly
      beaten and threatened her during their relationship. Hence, the jury would
      be exposed to even more of Hertel’s general propensity for violence. </span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span

      avoid propensity evidence. Mr. Hertel’s record alone demonstrates a criminal
      pattern of violence. Ms. Snow’s evidence as to Mr. Hertel’s confession
      is tied into his violence towards her. No matter how skilful counsel will
      be in the examination of the witnesses, the jury will be presented with
      a picture of Mr. Hertel which involves considerable violence. Can my instructions
      to them overcome any obstacles created by such evidence or impressions?
      I have great difficulty in expecting such instructions to be successful
      on this issue.</span></p>

      respect of both Hertel and the appellant. As against the appellant, Crown
      counsel tendered a highly emotive body of bad character evidence from his
      former common law spouse, Heather Moorehead. Among other things, Ms. Moorehead
      testified about the appellant’s drug use, his unprovoked attack on an elderly
      woman with a heart condition and his acts of violence and threats of violence
      towards her (including threats to kill her), sometimes carried out in the
      presence of their distraught infant children. As well, Crown counsel was

      as it related to Hertel and the appellant and he explained its limited
      use. In particular, he cautioned the jury that the evidence had been permitted “for
      the sole purpose of allowing [the jurors] as the judges of the facts, to
      determine who is more likely to have killed Ms.&nbsp;Bonn, Mr. Vanezis
      or Mr. Hertel”. He further told the jury that they could not use the propensity
      evidence “as evidence of Mr. Vanezis’s guilt of the offence charged” or “as
      evidence that Mr. Vanezis is a bad person”, nor could they use it to “punish

      Hertel’s motive to kill Ms.&nbsp;Bonn and his confessions to others that
      he had in fact done so. If the defence had any chance of success, it was
      essential that those two items of evidence be presented to the jury. That

      for violence arose only in the context of his confession to Ms. Snow; it
      did not arise on the evidence pertinent to his motive to kill Ms. Bonn.
      As defence counsel quite properly pointed out, Hertel’s previous threats
      and act of violence towards Ms. Bonn were not being led to show that he
      was the kind of person likely to have killed her but that he was in fact
      the person who killed her.</span></p>

      for Hertel’s criminal record and his prior convictions for violence against
      third parties, defence counsel’s undertaking that she would not question
      him on the details of those convictions was significant. It meant that
      in instructing the jury on the use they could make of Hertel’s prior convictions
      for violence, the trial judge was free to treat Hertel as though he were
      an accused who had not put his character in issue. In other words, he could
      have instructed the jury that they were only entitled to use Hertel’s prior
      convictions for violence against third parties to assess his credibility
      and for no other purpose. That instruction would have prevented the jury
      from using them as evidence of his general propensity for violence.</span></p>

      to recapitulate, apart from any inference that might arise from Hertel’s
      confession to Ms. Snow, his general propensity for violence formed no part
      of the appellant’s case. As for the confession, it involved a single isolated
      threat of violence towards Ms. Snow. In my respectful view, standing alone,
      it did not justify opening the door to evidence of the appellant’s general
      propensity for violence. To the extent that it posed a concern, the trial
      judge could have told the jury that Hertel’s threat to Ms. Snow was something
      that they could consider in assessing her credibility (i.e. she disliked
      him and therefore had a motive to harm him), and for no other reason. </span></p>

      of this is to say that on the approach proposed by the defence, Hertel’s

      reasons already mentioned, it was the Crown who wished to expose the jury
      to Hertel’s prior acts of violence towards third parties. In that regard,
      while it is not for me to say, it is difficult to understand how Hertel’s
      violence towards third parties was likely to assist the jury in deciding
      whether his confessions were true or not. To the extent that Hertel’s credibility
      mattered, the Crown was of course at liberty to cross-examine him in detail
      on all of his prior convictions for dishonesty. In that regard, there was
      no shortage of ammunition. Hertel had no less than thirty-seven such convictions.
      In the end, Crown counsel did not seek to discredit Hertel. Instead, he
      invited the jury to accept, as truthful, Hertel’s denial that he had made
      the confessions attributed to him.</span></p>

      that as it may, it hardly seems fair that the defence should be called
      to account for a strategy pursued by the Crown that placed Hertel’s general
      propensity for violence squarely before the jury when the defence sought
      to keep that evidence away from the jury. By any measure, the effect of
      the Crown’s strategy was insidious and unfair to the appellant. It enabled
      the Crown to lead evidence of Hertel’s general propensity for violence
      and then cry foul because the jury did not have comparable evidence in
      respect of the appellant. </span></p>

      contained within the confession itself, I can well understand why Crown
      counsel would want to expose other threats or acts of violence towards
      her by Hertel. Arguably, such conduct would provide her with a motive to
      give false evidence against him. Accepting that, as I have already pointed
      out, the trial judge could have told the jury that Hertel’s prior acts
      of violence towards her could only be used to assess her credibility and
      for no other reason. Indeed, although somewhat unorthodox, he could have
      gone further and told the jury that they were not to use the evidence of
      Hertel’s violence towards third parties to infer that he was the sort of
      person likely to have murdered Ms.&nbsp;Bonn. Unorthodox or not, defence
      counsel invited the trial judge to give just such a limiting instruction

      defence counsel a chance to pursue the strategy that she proposed i.e.
      one that would have steered clear of Hertel’s general propensity for violence.

      that it was their opinion, not Detective Tout’s that mattered.</span></p>

      trial judge opted for the Crown’s suggestion. In his charge to the jury,
      under the heading “Presumption of Innocence”, he admonished the jury as
      follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
class=MsoPageNumber>The fact that Mr. Vanezis was arrested and charged with an
      offence in 1995, or that Detective Sergeant Tout has caused an investigation
      and pursued this prosecution, is in no way an indication of guilt.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

class=MsoPageNumber>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The
      trial judge then reminded the jury that the appellant was presumed to be
      innocent, that there was no burden on him to prove anything and that the
      onus rested with the Crown throughout to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable
      doubt. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>On
      appeal, the appellant renews his submission that Detective Sergeant Tout’s
      evidence concerning the five suspects and his reasons for excluding all
      of them, except the appellant, was improper opinion evidence. I agree.
      The defence made no attack on the police investigation. Accordingly, there
      was no basis for the kind of evidence given by Detective Sergeant Tout.
      In my view, the impugned evidence was inadmissible for two reasons: first,
      it was irrelevant; second, it constituted impermissible opinion evidence.
      The Crown should not have led it and the jury should not have heard it.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      the circumstances, I am not persuaded that the trial judge’s “curative” instruction
      was adequate. In my respectful view, he should have told the jury to ignore
      Detective Sergeant Tout’s evidence, as defence counsel had requested.</span></p>

      that as it may, had this error stood alone, I would have applied the curative
      proviso and upheld the conviction. The Detective Sergeant’s belief that
      the Crown was prosecuting the right man would have come as no surprise
      to the jury and I doubt that this would have influenced the jury in its
      decision-making process. Those who believe otherwise have less faith in
      the jury system than I.</span></p>

      appellant submits that the trial judge erred in failing to warn the jury
      to proceed with caution before acting on the evidence of De Paepe and Hertel,
      without more, to convict him. (See <i>R. v. Vetrovec</i> (1982), 67 C.C.C.
      (2d) 1 (S.C.C.)). In support of his submission, he stresses the importance
      of their evidence to the Crown’s case and the several factors that served
      to undermine their credibility, including their lengthy criminal records,
      their unsavoury lifestyles, their motive to save themselves at his expense
      and the internal and external inconsistencies in their testimony.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      give effect to it. By that, I do not mean to suggest that it would have
      been improper had the trial judge given a warning along the lines requested;
      he could have done so. In my view however, it was not essential. </span></p>

      trial judge provided the jury with thorough and detailed instructions on
      the factors they should consider in assessing the worth of De Paepe and
      Hertel’s evidence. In particular, he alerted the jury to their extensive
      criminal records and the use the jury could make of them in assessing credibility;
      he instructed the jury on the impeachment value of their prior inconsistent
      statements; and, he told the jury, albeit in general terms, to consider
      whether a witness had “an interest in the outcome of the case, or any reason
      to give evidence that is more favourable to one side than to the other”.
      Here, the incentive for Hertel and De Paepe to falsely implicate the appellant
      was obvious and the jury would have intuitively understood the need to
      assess their evidence with care before acting on it, without more, to reject
      the appellant’s “alternate suspect”
    defence.</span></p>

      Paepe and Hertel’s evidence, including the absence of noticeable facial
      hair on the man pushing the recycling bin (Hertel had a very long beard
      at the time) and the virtual absence of any evidence connecting De Paepe
      or Hertel to the crime scene in the appellant’s apartment. This instruction
