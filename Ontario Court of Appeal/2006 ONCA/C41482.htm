style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Carole
    Little, Gerald Little and Neil Brillenger were charged with fraud over $5,000.  Carole
    Little and Neil were also charged with
    public mischief.  The Crown’s case was that they participated in a joint
    enterprise to defraud Carole Little’s insurer by falsely reporting the theft
    of her truck.  They were tried jointly by a trial composed of a judge and
    jury.  The Crown’s main witness against the accused was Randy Lowe.  At the
    conclusion of the trial Carole Little and Gerald Little were found guilty
    of fraud.  Carole Little was also found guilty of public mischief.  Neil
    Brillenger was acquitted of both charges.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Carole
    Little and Gerald Little appeal on the ground that the jury’s verdicts were
    inconsistent between the co-accused and therefore their conviction was unreasonable.  The
    respondent’s position is that the verdicts were not inconsistent, the evidence
    against each co-accused was not the same, the convictions against the appellants
    were reasonable and the acquittal of one accused while the appellants were
    convicted does not mean that the appellants are entitled to acquittals.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the position of the Crown is correct.  On the entirety of the evidence
    admissible against Neil Brillenger, including his own evidence, the jury
    must have been left with a reasonable doubt that he had participated in the
    fraudulent scheme to defraud Carole Little’s insurer which the evidence indicated
    had been developed by Carole Little, Gerald Little and Randy Lowe.  On the
    other hand, the jury was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Carole
    Little and Gerald Little had participated in the scheme to defraud the insurer
    as they were convicted of that offence.  In addition Carole Little was convicted
    of the offence of public mischief.  These were verdicts that were available
    to the jury on the evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    test to be applied is this: the issue is not whether Neil Brillenger’s acquittal
    was reasonable, but whether the convictions of Carole Little and Gerald Little
    were not reasonable.  Stated differently, the critical question is not whether
    Neil Brillenger was properly acquitted, but whether Carole Little and Gerald
    Little were properly convicted.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the convictions were reasonable.  The jury, in convicting Carole
    Little and Gerald Little, must have rejected their attempt to provide an
    exculpatory explanation.  In addition, the jury must have accepted the evidence
    of Randy Lowe and his former wife that clearly supported the existence of
    the fraudulent scheme and the commission of the offence of public mischief.  Moreover,
    the evidence against the Littles was much stronger than the evidence against
    Neil Brillenger.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    in our view the convictions were reasonable.  We would dismiss the appeal.</p>
