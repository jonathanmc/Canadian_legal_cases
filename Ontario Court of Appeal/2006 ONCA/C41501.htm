    </span> Speaking generally about the nature of a letter of credit, Lovekin 
    J. said, at p. 545: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>The offer or proposal, put forward in the letter of credit, once 
    accepted by a third party by way of the advance of goods or money, becomes 
    an irrevocable pledge of money which the maker is bound to honour.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>In the case of an irrevocable letter of credit the author of the letter 
    of credit is left without any right of retraction or other means of avoiding 
    his obligation of meeting the fiscal promise given, for he has irrevocably 
    committed the specified dollar value to honour a payment generated upon the 
    happening of certain specific events.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>That a letter 
    of credit has inherent value is clear from the fact that the irrevocable pledge 
    to pay up to a face amount is sufficient to induce a third party to advance 
    goods or services upon being made aware of the existence of the letter.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the commercial world of today it is common 
    practice to use letters of credit to guarantee a specific amount of ready 
    cash to initiate and carry a specific project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>To give a mortgage against the asset that will ultimately benefit from 
    those funds, namely, the realty concerned, is again common practice.<span

    to cash to its full face value at the moment it is given</i> [emphasis added].<u></u></p>

    &#8220;money&#8217;s worth actually advanced or supplied&#8221; within the meaning of s. 72 
    of the <i>Registry Act</i>, Lovekin J. observed, at p. 546 that: &#8220;The face 
    value of the irrevocable letter of credit is money or money&#8217;s worth put at 
    risk forthwith&#8221;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Therefore, Lovekin

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>An order, other

    </span> I have read the reasons of my colleague Juriansz J.A. in which he 
    would allow Dr. Dickie&#8217;s appeal. My colleague has concluded first, that although 
    Dr. Dickie continues to flout the support order made by Kiteley J. and the 
    orders for security made by Greer J., this court has no discretion to refuse 
    to entertain and decide his appeal; and second, that the contempt power cannot 
    be used to enforce the orders of Greer J., because each order was an order 
    for &#8220;the payment of money&#8221; under r. 60.11(1) of the <i>Rules of Civil</i> 
    <i>Procedure</i>. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> I have reached a different conclusion on both issues. First, in my 
    view, this court has discretion to refuse to entertain Dr. Dickie&#8217;s appeal 
    and, on the record before us, it should exercise that discretion. The court 
    should adjourn the appeal until Dr. Dickie complies with the orders of Greer 
    J. Second, assuming that the court entertains the appeal, the orders of Greer 
    J. requiring Dr. Dickie to secure his support obligations by an irrevocable 
    letter of credit and to post security for costs are not orders for the payment 
    of money under r. 60.11(1), because neither order amounts to a fixed debt 
    obligation requiring Dr. Dickie to pay money to the Respondent Leaka Dickie. 
    Thus, the court can use its contempt power for a breach of these orders. Finally, 
    on the other issue argued by Dr. Dickie &#8211; that he was denied a fair hearing 
    in the contempt proceedings before Stewart J. &#8211; I am satisfied that he was 
    afforded adequate procedural fairness. I would therefore dismiss his appeal.

    two boys, Mark, now 23 years old, and Scott, 18 years old, and a 21-year-old

    practised medicine in Sarnia, Ontario. Mrs. Dickie and the children have been 
    almost entirely dependent on him for support. After the parties separated, 
    Dr. Dickie paid support under the terms of a separation agreement made in

    of his children. When support lapsed under the parties&#8217; agreement, Dr. Dickie 
    stopped paying support altogether, despite Mrs. Dickie&#8217;s obvious need. She

    </span> In late June 2002, nearly a year after Kiteley J.&#8217;s order, Mrs. Dickie 
    received an anonymous letter that said: &#8220;Ken Dickie is secretly preparing 
    to flee the country within a couple of weeks, to the Bahamas, where he chooses

    an undertaking that he gave on a discovery to advise Mrs. Dickie&#8217;s solicitors

    </span> On discovering his move, Mrs. Dickie brought an urgent motion to restrain 
    Dr. Dickie from dealing with his RRSPs. She was too late. Wright J. granted 
    the relief she sought, but by then Dr. Dickie had already cashed most of his 
    RRSPs. He cashed the remainder after Wright J.&#8217;s order. In all, he recouped 
    over $300,000. He has never disclosed what he did with the money. </p>

    </span> By November 2002, Dr. Dickie was already behind in his support obligations. 
    Mrs. Dickie applied to the court for an order that the support owing to her 
    be paid from the proceeds of the sale of Dr. Dickie&#8217;s home in Sarnia, which 
    were being held by his real estate solicitor. In November 2002, LaForme J. 
    made the order. It did not help. Dr. Dickie had put a mortgage on his home 
    and the mortgagee, the Bank of Montreal, had priority over the proceeds. All 
    Mrs. Dickie received was support for one month: November 2002. Since then, 
    until the date of the final hearing of the contempt motion in January 2004, 
    Dr. Dickie paid no support at all &#8211; neither child support nor spousal support. 
    He never sought to vary or appeal Kiteley J.&#8217;s order. He simply refused to 
    comply with it. During the argument of this appeal, his counsel advised the 
    court that Dr. Dickie is now paying some support. We were not told how much. 
    Apparently, however, his support arrears exceed $100,000.</p>

    </span> Unfortunately, but hardly coincidentally, Bahamas does not have legislation 
    permitting reciprocal enforcement of judgments. Therefore, Mrs. Dickie is 
    powerless to enforce Kiteley J.&#8217;s support order in the Bahamas. On the record 
    before this court, the inference that Dr. Dickie moved to the Bahamas to frustrate 
    Kiteley J.&#8217;s order, and to avoid his obligation to support his children and 
    his former wife, is overwhelming. His current wife admitted as much in a letter 
    to the children in which she said, &#8220;Though we will not continue to pay you 
    the unbelievable amounts of money your mother has not so graciously received 
    in the past we do expect to work hard in our new environment in the Bahamas.&#8221;</p>

    </span> Dr. Dickie&#8217;s refusal to pay the court-ordered support has had disastrous 
    consequences for his children and for his former wife. The two older children 
    stopped their education because they could not afford it. Mark, the eldest, 
    dropped out of university because he could not both do his studies and work 
    full-time. Erin could not get her high school diploma without a special needs 
    tutor, which her mother could not afford. Scott, the youngest, also needs 
    a tutor to help him finish high school. His mother cannot afford that expense 
    either. Nor does she have any money for the children&#8217;s extra-curricular activities. 
    She has depleted all of her RRSPs and has no savings. She is even at risk 
    of losing the family home. </p>

    J.&#8217;s order. The motion was adjourned twice, once for a case conference and 
    once at Dr. Dickie&#8217;s request. It was heard on January 13, 2004. Dr. Dickie 
    did not attend. Instead, he filed a written &#8220;unsworn&#8221; submission, which Stewart 
    J. considered, despite the objection of Mrs. Dickie&#8217;s counsel. Stewart J. 
    found Dr. Dickie in contempt. She concluded that Dr. Dickie had wilfully refused 
    to comply with Greer J.&#8217;s orders that he post a letter of credit and security 
    for costs. She gave him a further month to purge his contempt. He did not 
    do so.</p>

    that Dr. Dickie be jailed for forty-five days, refused to stay her order, 
    and ordered that Dr. Dickie pay costs in excess of $16,000. Dr. Dickie served

    </span> I begin with these two points. First, I propose to adjourn Dr. Dickie&#8217;s 
    appeal, not to dismiss it. Second, this is not a case where an appellant is 
    being deprived of his right to appeal because of impecuniosity. On the record 
    before us, Dr. Dickie has the means to satisfy the orders of Greer J. Certainly, 
    he has filed no evidence to suggest otherwise. He has chosen not to comply. 
    Once he does comply, he will have his day in this court.</p>

    </span> Juriansz J.A. recognizes the general rule that a court will not hear 
    a litigant who has wilfully breached a court order until the litigant has 
    cured the breach. However, my colleague says that the rule is subject to an 
    exception where, as in this case, &#8220;the appellant seeks to attack the jurisdiction 
    of the court below to make the contempt order and impose a sentence against 
    him.&#8221;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In my view, neither principle nor precedent supports this limitation 
    or exception. First, principle. The general rule against granting an audience 
    to a contemnor who has failed to purge the contempt reflects the exercise 
    of the court&#8217;s discretion. That discretion is grounded in the inherent jurisdiction 
    of the court to control its own processes and, in Ontario, in s. 140(5) of 
    the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, which gives the court express power to stay 
    or dismiss a proceeding as an abuse of process. The rationale underlying this 
    exercise of discretion is that a court will not allow a litigant to abuse 
    the court&#8217;s processes, or to impede the course of justice, or to undermine 
    the court&#8217;s ability to enforce its own orders. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> This rationale argues not for carving out categorical exceptions to 
    the exercise of the court&#8217;s discretion, but for a flexible approach to the 
    exercise of this discretion. If needed to meet its underlying rationale, the 
    court will exercise its discretion, apply the general rule, and refuse to 
    entertain an appeal until the wilful breach is cured. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The exercise of the court&#8217;s discretion to refuse to hear the appeal 
    of a litigant who has not cured a wilful breach of a court order obviously 
    applies when the order appealed is the very order the litigant has refused 
    to obey. But the court&#8217;s discretion may also be invoked when the order appealed 
    is closely connected to an order or orders wilfully breached. See <i>Innovation 
    and Development Partners/IDP Inc. v. Canada</i> (1994), 114 D.L.R. (4th) 326 
    at 330 (F.C.A.). And, similarly, the court&#8217;s discretion may also be invoked 
    where an appellant seeks to attack a contempt order on the ground that the 
    trial court had no jurisdiction to make it. To preclude altogether the exercise 
    of the court&#8217;s discretion in such a case would make a mockery of the rationale 
    for the general rule. Instead, in each case the court must consider whether 
    hearing the appeal before the breach is cured would abuse the court&#8217;s process 
    or impede the course of justice.</p>

    </span> Second, precedent. My colleague finds support for his position in 
    various English authorities, beginning with the judgment of Rohmer L.J. in 
    <i>Hadkinson v.</i> <i>Hadkinson</i>, [1952] 2 All E.R. 567 (C.A.), and in 
    the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in <i>Apple Computer, Inc. v. 
    MacKintosh Computers Ltd</i>., [1988] 1 F.C. 191 (F.C.A.). In my respectful 
    view, this case law does not support Juriansz J.A.&#8217;s position. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In <i>Hadkinson</i>, Rohmer L.J. suggested various exceptions to the 
    general rule against hearing a litigant who has failed to cure a wilful breach 
    of a court order, including the exception my colleague relies upon. However, 
    in <i>Hadkinson</i>, Lord Denning wrote concurring reasons and took a more 
    flexible approach, the approach I argue for. He wrote at 575: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I am of the opinion 
    that the fact that a party to a cause has disobeyed an order of the court 
    is not of itself a bar to his being heard, but if his disobedience is such 
    that, so long as it continues, it impedes the course of justice in the cause, 
    by making it more difficult for the court to ascertain the truth or to enforce 
    the orders which it may make, then the court may in its discretion refuse 
    to hear him until the impediment is removed or good reason is shown why it 
    should not be removed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Lord Denning&#8217;s more flexible approach has largely been adopted in 
    later case law. In their text, <i>The Law of Contempt,</i> 3<sup>rd</sup> 
    ed. (London: Butterworths, 1996) Nigel Lowe and Brenda Sufrin summarize the 
    modern position at 653:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>Although subsequent cases can be found supporting Rohmer L.J.&#8217;s approach, 
    the growing weight of judicial opinion now favours Denning L.J.&#8217;s more flexible 
    approach. Lord Bridge said in <i>X Ltd. v. Morgan-Grampian Ltd</i>.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'> [1] </span></span></a>:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>I cannot 
    help thinking that the more flexible treatment of the jurisdiction as one 
    of <u>discretion</u> to be exercised in accordance with the principle stated 
    by Denning L.J. better accords with contemporary judicial attitudes to the 
    importance of ensuring procedural justice [rather] than confining its exercise 
    within the limits of a <u>strict rule subject to defined exceptions</u> [emphasis 
    added].</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Even in <i>Apple Computer</i>, Urie J.A. at para. 29 recognized that 
    to impose categorical exceptions on the discretion whether to stay an appeal 
    would improperly fetter that discretion:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The second of 
    those exceptions it was said by counsel for the appellants applied to this 
    case because the appeal is from the very order -- the injunction <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>-- upon which the alleged contempt was based. 
    I do not think that His Lordship meant his statement to be taken so literally. 
    I have this view for several reasons. First, it is clear that whether to grant 
    a stay or not is in the exercise of a discretion. If the rule is as categorical 
    as he appears to have said it is, no discretion could be exercised where the 
    appeal is from the very order said to be in contempt. That would constitute 
    a complete fettering of that discretion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Instead, Urie J.A. at para. 34 emphasized that in exercising its discretion 
    whether to allow an appeal to proceed, the court should take into account 
    the nature of the contempt and its effect on the course of justice:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>From all of the 
    foregoing I think it proper for me to express the view that the preferable 
    rule is that, in the exercise of its discretion to permit an appeal to proceed 
    or to refuse to do so, a court must have regard, inter alia, to the particular 
    circumstances of the contempt and its effect on the proper administration 
    of justice, i.e. whether it constitutes an impediment to the course of justice. 
    Whether or not it will, of course, will be dependent upon the facts of the 
    contempt and the Court&#8217;s view of their effect. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
mso-list:none'>In other words, in exercising its discretion, the court should 
    consider the underlying rationale for that discretion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> What then of the present case? An important precedent for this case 
    is the decision of this court in one of the appeals brought by Paul Magder: 
    <i>Ontario (A.G.) v. Paul Magder Furs Ltd.</i> (1991), 6 O.R. (3d) 188 (C.A.). 
    The facts of that case are strikingly parallel to the facts of the present 
    case. The Ontario government had obtained an order under the <i>Retail</i> 
    <i>Business Holidays Act</i> requiring Magder to close his business on Sunday 
    and other holidays. Magder refused to comply with it, contending that the 
    statutory authority for the orders was unconstitutional. So the government 
    brought a motion to have him found in contempt. The motion was granted and 
    Magder was found in contempt. He then appealed the contempt order. This court 
    refused to entertain the appeal. Brooke J.A. wrote the court&#8217;s reasons. They 
    apply with equal force to Dr. Dickie&#8217;s appeal (at 193):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In my opinion, 
    it is an abuse of process to assert a right to be heard by the court and at 
    the same time refuse to undertake to obey the order of the court so long as 
    it remains in force. That is this case. Magder&#8217;s disobedience from the beginning 
    and now is such that it impedes the course of justice and impairs the ability 
    of the court to enforce its orders. It is a general rule that a party in contempt 
    will not be heard in the proceedings until the contempt is purged &#8230; Accordingly, 
    I think the court ought not to grant an audience to Magder until it has purged 
    its contempt and undertakes to abide by the orders of Farley J. as to closing 
    on holidays, of Chilcott J. as to advertising, and of this court. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In short, this court refused to entertain Magder&#8217;s contempt appeal 
    when he had deliberately defied the orders giving rise to the contempt motion. 
    Similarly, this court should refuse to entertain Dr. Dickie&#8217;s contempt appeal 
    as he has deliberately refused to comply with the orders of Kiteley J. and 
    Greer J., which gave rise to the contempt motion. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> That Magder disputed of the court&#8217;s jurisdiction to make the underlying 
    orders, and that Dr. Dickie disputes the court&#8217;s jurisdiction to make the 
    contempt order, is a distinction of no significance to the exercise of the 
    court&#8217;s discretion. In both cases, the appellant wilfully and continuously 
    &#8220;thumbed his nose&#8221; at the court. In both cases, hearing the appeal before 
    the contempt is purged would impede the course of justice and would impair 
    the ability of the court to enforce its own orders.<span style="mso-spacerun:

    </span> In <i>Innovation and Development Partners/IDP Inc., supra</i>, the 
    Federal Court of Appeal similarly exercised its discretion. In that case, 
    IDP had sued the government of Canada in three related actions. It brought 
    a motion for summary judgment in one of the actions. When it brought its motion, 
    IDP was in contempt of two orders of the Federal Court, and had refused to 
    obey four other orders. The responding party to the motion, the Government 
    of Canada, sought to quash IDP&#8217;s motion because IDP had not purged its contempt. 
    The motions judge refused to quash, but the Federal Court of Appeal reversed. 
    The court quashed IDP&#8217;s motion and stayed all of its other actions against 
    the Government until it abided by the court&#8217;s orders.</p>

    </span> Decary J.A. recognized (at 330) that the &#8220;general rule does not prevent 
    the party in contempt for non-obedience in one cause from making an application 
    to the court in another cause relating to a distinct matter, although the 
    parties to such other cause may be the same.&#8221; However, he was of the view 
    that &#8220;as the three actions are so closely connected as to warrant a hearing 
    on the same day, it would frustrate the purpose of the general rule to allow 
    a party found in contempt in one of the three actions to proceed in the other 
    two.&#8221; Because IDP had shown &#8220;a flagrant and systematic disregard for orders 
    of this court,&#8221; (at 331) it was not entitled to proceed with its litigation.

    defied the orders for security of Greer J. His disregard and defiance of the 
    court&#8217;s orders has impeded the course of justice for Mrs. Dickie and her children. 
    Indeed, the children&#8217;s interests is an added consideration supporting the 
    exercise of the court&#8217;s discretion to deny Dr. Dickie an audience until he 
    cures his contempt. In <i>The Law of Contempt</i> at 654, the authors observe:</p>

    and the effect of the order for payment. Where money is ordered to be paid 
    not to the creditor but into court &#8211; or its functional equivalent, to a solicitor 
    to be held in trust &#8211; and where the effect of the order is not to create a 
    fixed debt obligation but to secure a debt obligation, then the order is not 
    an order for the payment of money under r. 60.11(1).</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> These 
    distinctions are supported by British law, from which our own law of contempt 
    originated. The English text, <i>The Law of Contempt,</i> 3<sup>rd</sup> ed., 
    <i>supra</i> at 582, discusses the important distinction between an order 
    directing a person to pay money to another person, and an order directing 
    a person to pay money into court. The latter order does not preclude the use 
    of the contempt power to enforce it:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>There are two 
    types of judgment or order which direct a person to pay money, namely, that 
    directing payment of money to another person and that directing payment of 
    money into court. Disobedience to either type of order can amount to contempt 
    but the importance of the distinction is that whereas the effect of an order 
    directing a person to pay money to another person is to create a debt, an 
    order to pay money into court does not necessarily imply the existence of 
    a debt. In the former case the court&#8217;s power to imprison persons who have 
    disobeyed the court order is very limited and can only be exercised in the 
    circumstances provided for by the Debtors Act 1869, s 4 and s 5. In the latter 
    case, however, where the order for payment into court is not in respect of 
    any debt but merely for the security, for example, of a wife&#8217;s costs, then 
    the power of the court is not affected by the Debtors Act 1869, s 4, and the 
    normal remedies of committal or sequestration are available. In <i>Bates v. 
    Bates</i> the Court of Appeal held that their power to punish a husband who 
    had defaulted in paying a sum of money into court, ordered for the security 
    of his wife&#8217;s costs in respect of her petition for judicial separation, was 
    unaffected by the Debtors Act 1869. Lindley L.J. said: </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>The question 
    turns upon the words of the 4<span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";
mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>th </span>section of the Debtors Act. 
    It is said that the appellant is within the protection of the Act, because 
    he has made default in payment of a sum of money. But what do the words &#8220;payment 
    of money&#8221; in this section mean? In my opinion, they do not mean depositing 
    a sum of money in court, to abide an order to be subsequently made.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 
    authors (at 583) discuss the underlying rationale for the different treatment 
    of a breach of an order to pay a creditor and the breach of an order for security: 
  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The essence of 
    the distinction seems to be that the payment of money as security is not a 
    debt within the meaning of the Debtors Act, because no definite and fixed 
    obligation to pay a sum of money has thereby been created. As Chitty J. said:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>Judgments 
    or orders for payments into court are generally not final: the money paid 
    in may be paid for security only for the safety of the fund, and the person 
    ordered to pay in not infrequently is entitled to have some part of the money 
    afterwards paid out to him.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>On the other 
    hand once the sum has become fixed, a definite obligation to pay a sum of 
    money is created and it is in essence therefore a debt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> This 
    rationale for the distinction between the two types of orders makes sense. 
    As my colleague points out in his reasons, the object of r. 60.11(1) is to 
    ensure that people are not imprisoned because they have not satisfied their 
    monetary obligations. This objective can be traced back to the English case 
    of <i>Bates v. Bates</i> (1888), 14 P.D. 17 (C.A.), where the court commented 
    (at 19) on the purpose of the Debtors Act: &#8220;The object of the Act was to prevent 
    the imprisonment of persons for nonpayment of ordinary debts.&#8221; The orders 
    of Greer J. do not create &#8220;ordinary debts.&#8221;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Ontario&#8217;s 
    <i>Family Law Rules</i> support my conclusion. As Juriansz J.A. points out, 
    in <i>Forrest v. Lacroix Estate</i> (2000), 48 O.R. (3d) 619 (C.A.), Morden 
    J.A. said that the contempt power under r. 60.11(1) should be interpreted 
    harmoniously with the contempt power under the <i>Family Law Rules</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Family 
    Law r. 31(1) and the definition of &#8220;payment order&#8221; under that rule make explicit 
    the distinction I have argued for in interpreting r. 60.11(1). Rule 31(1) 
    of the <i>Family Law Rules</i> precludes the use of the contempt power to 
    enforce a &#8220;payment order&#8221;: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>31(1) An order, 
    other than a payment order, may be enforced by a contempt motion made in the 
    case in which the order was made, even if another penalty is available.</p>

    order&#8221; is defined in Family Law r. 2 as an order &#8220;requiring a person to pay 
    money to another person&#8221;: </p>

    in <i>Coletta v. Coletta,</i> [2003] O.J. No. 81 (Sup. Ct. J.) (QL), J.W. 
    Quinn J. held that the breach of an order to pay the proceeds of the sale 
    of a matrimonial home into court could be enforced by a contempt motion, because 
    it was not a payment order. Similarly, I conclude that the orders of Greer 
    J. are not &#8220;payment orders&#8221; or<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>&#8220;orders 
    for the payment of money,&#8221; because they do not require Dr. Dickie to pay money 
    to his former wife. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> My 
    colleague distinguishes <i>Coletta</i> on the ground that here Dr. Dickie 
    was ordered to pay security for costs, not into court, but to Mrs. Dickie&#8217;s 
    solicitor to be held in an interest-bearing trust account. In Juriansz J.A.&#8217;s 
    view, Dr. Dickie was thus ordered to pay money to another person. I respectfully 
    disagree. I see no meaningful distinction between <i>Coletta</i> and this 
    case. As I said earlier, an order that security be paid to a solicitor to 
    be held in trust is the functional equivalent of an order that the security 
    be paid into court. In both cases, what is ordered is security, not a payment 
    from a debtor to a creditor. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> My 
    colleague argues that my conclusion would &#8220;render nugatory &#8221; the exception 
    in r. 60.11(1). In his view, a successful litigant would simply have to persuade 
    the court to order an unsuccessful litigant to give irrevocable security for 
    a monetary order. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Respectfully, 
    I find this argument unpersuasive. It fails to take into account that the 
    court retains discretion whether to order security, and whether to use the 
    contempt power to enforce the failure to provide it. As with any judicial 
    discretion, this discretion must be exercised in accordance with established 
    principles. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Orders 
    for security of the kind made by Greer J. will, as a matter of principle, 
    be warranted only where there is a real risk of non-payment. Dr. Dickie&#8217;s 
    obvious intent to disregard his support obligations made it reasonable to 
    order security in this case. Just because these orders were made in this case 
    does not mean that they will be made in all cases.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I 
    add as a post-script that the exclusion in r. 60.11(1) refers only to orders 
    for the payment of money; the rule does not exclude the use of the contempt 
    power for breach of an order to post security. I therefore do not think that 
    my colleague&#8217;s interpretation of the exclusion is justified, even for an order 
    for security that amounts to money or money&#8217;s worth. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Dr. 
    Dickie submits that he did not receive a fair hearing in the proceedings before 
    Stewart J. His two main complaints are first, that he was not served personally 
    (or by substituted service) with the notice of the return of the contempt 
    motion on January 13, 2004; and second, that Stewart J. proceeded in his absence 
    and made a finding of contempt against him, without affording him an opportunity

    do not accept this submission. Although perhaps the conduct of the contempt 
    motion was not perfect, it did afford Dr. Dickie adequate procedural fairness. 
    Contempt proceedings, even for breach of a civil order, are quasi-criminal. 
    Thus, Dr. Dickie had the right to be served with the notice of motion particularizing 
    the allegations of contempt, the right to a hearing, the right to be presumed 
    innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and the right to make 
    full answer and defence, including the right to counsel, the right to cross-examine 
    witnesses against him, and the right to call evidence.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Dr. 
    Dickie was given all these rights. Six months before the motion proceeded, 
    he was served by mail and fax with the notice of motion particularizing the 
    allegations of contempt. The motion was originally returnable on June 19, 
    2003. Dr. Dickie&#8217;s father-in-law attended for him. The motion was adjourned 
    to September 26, 2003, for a case conference. Dr. Dickie attended the case 
    conference, but still refused to pay one penny of support. The contempt motion 
    was adjourned to December 30, 2003. Dr. Dickie wrote a letter requesting a 
    further adjournment. Lowe J. granted his request, and adjourned the hearing 
    of the motion to January 13, 2004. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Dr. 
    Dickie was served with notice of the return of the motion by fax and courier. 
    It might have been better had he been personally served. However, Stewart 
    J. addressed the question of service, and found that Dr. Dickie was &#8220;well 
    aware of the existence of this motion and its present return date, the nature 
    of the relief sought, and the evidentiary foundation upon which the motion 
    is made.&#8221; The record amply supports her finding.</p>

    being aware of the contempt motion for six months, and of the return date 
    on January 13, 2004, Dr. Dickie chose not to retain counsel or to appear. 
    Instead, he sent in a written submission, which Stewart J. considered before 
    making her finding of contempt. Even after finding Dr. Dickie in contempt, 
    she gave him a further month to purge his contempt before sentencing him. 
    He did not do so.</p>

    for the contempt hearing. And importantly, he filed no evidence to show what 
    defence he would have mounted had he been present before Stewart J. on January 
    13, 2004. I am satisfied that he was given adequate procedural fairness, and 
    indeed as Mr. Niman points out in his factum, wide latitude to put forward 
    his defence. I would therefore not give effect to Dr. Dickie&#8217;s submission
