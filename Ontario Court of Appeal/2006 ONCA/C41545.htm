  <h3>Overview </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 7, 2001 a private jet landed at Lake Simcoe Regional Airport (“Simcoe
    Airport”) carrying 263 bricks of cocaine weighing 269 kg and 17 bricks of
    hashish weighing 16.4 kg.  While taxiing back from the end of the runway
    after landing, the pilot executed a 180° turn and stopped at a point where
    the runway intersects the Oro-Medonte 6<sup>th</sup> Line.  The plane’s door
    was opened and the drugs, in hockey bags, were tossed to several men who
    were waiting on the 6<sup>th</sup> Line in a pickup truck and an SUV.  One
    of the passengers on the jet jumped out of the plane.  The plane, with its
    pilot, co-pilot and one remaining passenger, then proceeded to the terminal
    for customs inspection.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    RCMP who were observing the entire operation, arrested everybody on the plane,
    as well as the men who were waiting with the pickup truck and SUV.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    pilot of the jet, Mr. Lyle Niemi, was tried by judge alone on charges of
    importing, trafficking, and possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking,
    and was acquitted on all counts.  The Crown appeals the acquittals on the
    basis of errors of law allegedly made by the trial judge.  I would allow
    the Crown’s appeal and order a new trial for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the trial judge committed several errors in analyzing the Crown’s position
    that Niemi was a member of a conspiracy to import drugs into Canada from
    Jamaica.  He erred by holding that Niemi’s own statements (recorded on wiretaps
    in conversation with the alleged co-conspirators) were inadmissible against
    him.  Niemi’s statements were admissions and therefore properly receivable
    into evidence irrespective of his membership in any conspiracy.  The trial
    judge also erred by concluding that evidence that Niemi was a member of the
    broad conspiracy to import drugs from Jamaica alleged by the Crown was inadmissible
    because the drugs were not brought into Canada by that conspiracy, but by
    a faction of conspirators acting independently.  Finally in this area, the
    trial judge erred by considering irrelevant factors in concluding that Niemi
    was not a member of the alleged conspiracy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;&quot;\[%2\:5\:0\:\]&quot; adairj 20060406T0752'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the trial judge’s finding that the Crown had not proved that Niemi was wilfully
    blind is incompatible with his earlier finding that the Crown had proved
    beyond a reasonable doubt that Niemi was not acting under duress when he
    flew the plane back to Canada from Jamaica.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>Facts</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;&quot;\[%2\:6\:0\:\]&quot; adairj 20060406T0752'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Alfredo
    Malanca and Dean Roberts were the principals in an ongoing conspiracy to
    import drugs into Canada from Jamaica.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Wiretap
    and surveillance evidence established that Niemi met with and had telephone
    conversations with Malanca.  On August 22, 2001, Malanca left a telephone
    message for Niemi with the receptionist of Executive Edge Air (the company
    Niemi worked for) using the fictitious name “John”, and declined to leave
    a surname when asked.  Niemi returned the call that evening.  That telephone
    conversation was oblique.  Malanca indicated that he wanted to meet Niemi,
    but declined to specify why, other than to say “I just want to talk to you
    about something.”  Niemi was angry with Malanca for leaving a message without
    leaving a last name because, according to Niemi, his receptionist was “getting
    awfully fuckin’ nosey.”  When Malanca protested that he only called once,
    Niemi explained that the receptionist was “getting snoopy”
    because he was receiving calls from “Magician...from you [without a last
    name]…from another guy and it’s just a name or, he knows who I am call me.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    he indicated that the call was personal, Malanca did remark “and if it’s
    work you, you know, always like work anyway don’t ya?”  Niemi replied, “Well
    I usually work out pretty well I think.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that these calls demonstrated that there was a relationship
    between Niemi and Malanca and that it was “hard to imagine”
    that this was a legitimate business relationship.  The trial judge specifically
    referred to the reference to meeting places and the use of code names, such
    as “Buddy” and “Magical”.  In addition, the trial judge felt that Niemi’s
    statements revealed that he was clearly familiar with the furtive terminology
    and understood the code names and words being used.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Niemi
    also had a relationship with Roberts, the other principal in the conspiracy
    to import drugs.  On September 19, 2001, Niemi had flown Roberts and Roberts’ wife
    to Nassau, Bahamas from Montréal, and then had flown them back to Montreal
    on September 21.  However, there is no evidence that Niemi was aware of the
    relationship between Roberts and Malanca.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    October 10, 2001, Roberts and Malanca discussed what appeared to the trial
    judge to be a plan to import drugs from Jamaica that had been delayed.  Roberts
    indicated in that call that he had a pilot, referred to by the codename “Patrick
    One”, on standby, and complained about owing Patrick One more money because
    of the delay.  The trial judge was satisfied that Niemi was Patrick One,
    though there was no evidence that Niemi himself was aware of this codename.  Malanca
    had been dealing with a pilot codenamed “Patrick Two”, and wanted Roberts
    to wait for that pilot to be available.  The trial judge found, “[I]t is
    clear that both pilots are anticipated by the main conspirators, Malanca
    and Roberts, to be resources for their enterprise.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    next day, Niemi called the Roberts’ home in Montréal and left a message for
    Roberts with his wife.  Roberts then called Malanca and a man named Blewitt.  In
    that call, Roberts angrily complained that Patrick One had called Roberts
    at home, despite having been told never to do so unless it was “life and
    death”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later
    that day, Roberts spoke with Malanca and told him that he had arranged for
    Patrick One to “go immediately... instead of waiting that long you know”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is unnecessary for the purpose of this appeal to describe the additional
    calls between Niemi and Roberts.  They were considered by the trial judge
    to demonstrate clearly that Niemi and Roberts were familiar enough in their
    dealings together that they could speak in vague, coded terms and still understand
    one another.  The trial judge also noted that throughout their conversations,
    names, places and times were not used. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    October 13, 2001, Niemi and his co-pilot Ross flew Roberts, Roberts’ wife
    and daughter, and two other men to Jamaica.  The two men were André Villareul
    and Jose Sousa.  Roberts, Villareul, and Sousa remained in Jamaica when the
    plane returned to Canada.  Arrangements were made to pick them up about two
    weeks later.  Villareul was on parole at the time and was not allowed to
    leave Canada.  As the trial judge noted, “his re-entry into Canada would
    have to be accomplished in a clandestine manner”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsequent
    events make it apparent that Roberts, Villareul and Sousa remained in Jamaica
    to obtain the drugs and get them ready for shipment to Canada.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    intercepted call number 11, on October 15, 2001, Niemi instructed the receptionist
    at Executive Edge Air to fax the confirmation for the trip just completed
    to Roberts, but to use the name Dean Riley on it instead of Dean Roberts.  He
    also instructed her to draw up quotes for two further flights: another trip
    to Nassau to drop off Roberts’ wife, and the flight to Jamaica to pick up
    Roberts.  He instructed the receptionist not to send the two quotes yet.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    intercepted calls show that in the next two weeks, Roberts, Malanca and their
    cohorts discussed arrangements involving Patrick Two and a possible Patrick
    Three.  On October 31, 2001, a flight with a different pilot left to fly
    to Jamaica to pick up Roberts.  The flight was aborted.  The trial judge
    commented that it was turned back, “either for security measures because
    the United States was on a terror alert after 9/11, or because of the weather”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the aborted flight, there were intercepted phone calls between Malanca and
    Blewitt in which Roberts was angry about not having been picked up yet and,
    according to Blewitt, “was freaking out”.  Roberts did not believe that the
    scheduled pickup flight had been turned back, and he wanted to speak to the
    pilot, but no one would provide him with the pilot’s number.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 1, 2001, Malanca told Blewitt to contact Roberts and tell him not
    to contact anyone.  In particular, Malanca wanted to ensure that Roberts
    did not call “my Patrick”, that is Patrick Two, as a call from Jamaica could
    bring his existence to the attention of the authorities and it would, as
    Malanca put it, “burn him for nothing”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Roberts
    then called Executive Edge Air himself to arrange to be picked up in Jamaica
    by Niemi.  The trial judge found that: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Niemi appears
    genuinely surprised that Roberts called him again and he clearly wants to
    go on this particular flight and is so anxious to go to Jamaica to pick up
    Roberts he leaves instructions to cancel other flights he had booked on the
    jet.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 1, 2001, Niemi left a message for Roberts indicating that he was
    willing to go down and pick him up but wanted to know if his associates would
    be coming back as well.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsequent
    calls between Malanca, Blewitt and Roberts make clear that at this point,
    Roberts was acting unilaterally and furtively.  However, Malanca knew that
    Roberts had arranged that Niemi would pilot the flight and was certain that
    it was for the drug run.  Malanca was livid.  The trial judge found that, “it
    is clear that Malanca mistrusts Roberts and thinks that Roberts is not only
    going to try to sneak Villareul back into Canada, but he is going to sneak
    the drugs in and steal his (Malanca’s) portion of the shipment.”  However,
    Malanca did not indicate to Roberts that he knew of Roberts’ plan, nor did
    he take any steps to stop Roberts.  He relied on Blewitt to protect his interests.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    Niemi departed to go to Jamaica to pick up Roberts and his cohorts, he left
    detailed written instructions for Darcy Roy to meet the plane at the intersection
    of the concession road and runway and to pick up a man there.  Roy was Niemi’s
    salesman at Executive Edge Air and a co-accused at trial.  Roy was acquitted
    and the Crown has not appealed that verdict.  The description of the man
    Roy was to pick up matched Villareul.</p>

    Roy from Jamaica and explained that, contrary to the written instructions
    he had left, Roy was to meet the plane and pick up “two hockey players” and “their
    bags”.  Niemi indicated that he would call Roy on his cell phone as the plane
    approached.  He instructed Roy to drive his silver Corvette and wear his
    orange Maple Leaf cap.  He further instructed Roy to call Canada Customs
    and rebook their attendance at Simcoe Airport for the next day, and not to
    change the passenger manifesto, even though there was going to be an extra
    person on board.  Finally, Niemi instructed Roy that if Canada Customs asked

    told Malanca that Roy was in contact with Niemi and was keeping them informed

    there is no evidence that he took any steps to alert anyone to the police
    presence.  From where Roy was parked, one could not see what was happening
    at the end of the 6th Line near the runway.  Roy was arrested as he sat in
    his vehicle, and he cooperated with the police.  In the trunk of his sports
    car, the police found a hockey bag with hockey equipment inside.  The police

    at approximately 4:00 or 5:00 a.m. and flew to Jamaica.  It was Ross’ understanding
    that the purpose of the trip was to pick up Roberts and his associates.  The
    plan was to return to Toronto to refuel and then transport the passengers
    to Montréal.  Niemi and Ross did not plan to stay overnight in Jamaica.  On
    arriving in Jamaica, they found that the clients were not ready to leave

    arranged for a hotel room for Niemi and Ross under false names.  Roberts

    assured Roberts he would do so.  There was a handgun on the table in front
    of Roberts.  Ross testified Niemi asked what it was for, and Roberts indicated, “to
    make sure people do what he wants” and “he gets what he wants done”.  Niemi
    produced for Roberts a rough drawing of the airport.  Roberts continued to
    press Niemi to call his (Niemi’s) friend and confirm that Niemi’s
    “guy” would be at the Simcoe Airport to meet Roberts’ friend.  Niemi used
    his cell phone, and Ross understood that he had confirmed with Roy that Roy
    would meet Roberts’
    friend.  The time Ross saw Niemi use his cell phone matches the intercepted

    the midst of more arguing back and forth, Roberts demanded the keys to the

    which a photograph fell to the floor.  There was evidence that the picture
    was of a house that looked similar to Niemi’s home.  When Niemi saw the picture,
    he began muttering profanities at Roberts.  Roberts responded by saying, “don’t

    Roberts and Niemi as concerned with whether Roberts could trust Niemi.</p>

    than he would have expected for two people.  He proceeded through airport
    security with them.  Villareul was travelling under the name André Reeda.  Ross

    of the runway.  Once they landed, they slowed the plane and taxied along
    the runway before turning around.  As they passed the pickup truck, Sousa
    yelled at Niemi to stop and go back.  Niemi turned the plane around and travelled
    back toward the direction of the pickup truck.  In the area of the pickup
    truck, he did another 180° turn and stopped.  Someone in the cabin opened
    the door.  Niemi got out of his seat for a brief moment, but did not leave
    the plane.</p>

    blocked Ross’ hand in a movement that Ross understood as directing him to
    leave the flaps in the extended position.  He immediately understood the
    purpose of Niemi’s direction, as leaving the flaps down is an international

    he had not seen them before.  He was evasive as to whether he had flown anybody
    from Roberts’ company before.  He did not tell the police he was forced to
    give up the keys to his plane to Roberts.  He professed to have no knowledge

    the evidence clearly demonstrated that Niemi had transported the drugs into
    Canada from Jamaica, the only question before the trial judge was whether
    Niemi had the requisite <i>mens rea</i>.  The defence argued that the Crown
    had failed to prove that Niemi had actual or imputed knowledge that the bags
    on his plane contained illegal drugs, and that even if he had such knowledge,
    the evidence did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that he was not
    acting under duress.</p>

    trial judge concluded that Niemi was not acting under duress, he was not
    a member of the conspiracy to transport the drugs into Canada, he had no
    actual knowledge that the hockey bags on the plane were full of drugs and,
    finally, that he did not act in a wilfully blind manner in flying the hockey
    bags into Canada.</p>

    trial judge first considered whether Niemi transported the bags containing
    the drugs into Canada under duress.  He concluded that the evidence did not
    reveal that Niemi did anything that would support the argument that he was
    acting out of fear or duress.  He found that the Crown had successfully disproved
    beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a threat of death or serious bodily
    harm to Niemi and that Niemi had no obvious safe means of escape.</p>

    making these findings, the trial judge noted that in Niemi’s statement to
    the police, he did not make any mention of having been threatened.  The only
    evidence of threats came from the testimony of Ross, who did not hear the
    entire conversation in the hotel room between Roberts and Niemi and did not
    recount specifically the words used or threats made.  Moreover, as Niemi
    did not discuss the threats with Ross when they were alone, Ross’ testimony
    could shed no light on the effect of any threats on Niemi.</p>

    the wiretap authorizations.  The second class of evidence consists of the
    statements made by other parties to the importation, which were also recorded
    pursuant to the wiretap authorizations.  Though the trial judge treated the
    recordings as one class of evidence, I will deal with each category independently.  It

    evidence as admissions: see <i>R. v. Pleich </i> (1980), 55 C.C.C. (2d) 13
    (Ont. C.A.) at 35.  Whether Niemi was or was not a member of the conspiracy,
    does not affect the admissibility of Niemi’s own statements.  His alleged

    between Malanca and Niemi was completely inadmissible for any purpose at
    the trial, the trial judge reviewed the incriminating statements that Niemi
    made in that conversation.  The trial judge referred to Niemi’s remark that
    the receptionist was becoming suspicious, his urging of Malanca to use a
    last name when he called, and his claim of having been a useful pilot in
    the past.  After alluding to these matters, the trial judge said, “however,

      statements of co-conspirators are admissible under this exception where:
      (1) it has been established beyond a reasonable doubt that a conspiracy
      existed; (2) the evidence directly admissible against the accused establishes,

    trial judge found that the Crown had proved that there was a conspiracy to
    import illicit narcotics into Canada and that Blewett, Malanca, and Roberts
    were members.  The trial judge then ruled that hearsay statements of the
    members of this conspiracy were not admissible against Niemi because the
    substantive offences did not flow from this conspiracy.  Rather, the importation
    of the drugs resulted from Roberts’ plan to bring the drugs to Canada independently
    and rip-off his co-conspirator Malanca.  The trial judge stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The actual importation
    was not a function of the conspiracy between Malanca, Blewett and Roberts.  The
    substantive offence was the result of Dean Roberts’ late-night decision in

    to the operating plan at the heart of the conspiracy.</p>

    taken the view that the offences resulted from the narrower conspiracy involving
    the Roberts group only, the trial judge reasoned that Niemi’s membership
    in the wider conspiracy was not relevant and so concluded that the intercepted
    calls involving Malanca and Blewett were inadmissible.  He said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It is reasonable
    to infer that Dean Roberts decided to independently bring the drugs to Canada
    to rip off his co-conspirator Malanca. Thus the substantive offences did
    not flow from the alleged conspiracy between Malanca, Blewitt and Roberts
    and as a result the co-conspirators exception is inapplicable therefore the
    calls, particularly those involving Malanca and Blewitt are utterly inadmissible
    against Mr. Niemi.</p>

    trial judge’s finding that the substantive offence of importing the drugs

    as I explain, it does not follow that evidence of Niemi’s membership in the
    broader conspiracy is irrelevant and inadmissible.</p>

    only issue in this case was whether Niemi knew that the bags he transported
    from Jamaica to Canada contained drugs.  In my view, evidence of Niemi’s
    membership in the broader conspiracy was admissible on the issue of his knowledge.  Roberts,
    Villareul and Sousa were in Jamaica as part of the wider conspiracy.  It
    was the wider conspiracy that planned the scheme, and assembled the drugs
    for transportation to Canada.  Niemi’s membership in that conspiracy, if
    proved, would be relevant to determining whether he had knowledge of what
    was in the bags that he flew into Canada.</p>

    factors to support his conclusion.  It is important to keep in mind that

    Malanca after the August 22, 2001 telephone call and any resulting meeting.  I
    see this fact as neutral.  The various members of a conspiracy may be expected
    to play different roles in accomplishing its objective.  The Crown’s theory
    was that Niemi was merely the pilot and there was no need for the conspirators
    to communicate with him until the drugs were ready to be transported.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second factor relied on by the trial judge is that it seems that Niemi was
    kept in the dark about the relationship between Malanca and Roberts.  While
    that may be so, in my view, it does not support a finding that Niemi was
    not part of the conspiracy.  The observation is equally consistent with a
    conspiracy in which the identities and relationships of its members are kept
    secret to the greatest extent possible.  Such a practice could certainly
    be expected of a conspiracy involving the importation of drugs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third factor was that Niemi never made any effort to contact Malanca or Blewett
    during the course of the conspiracy and his only contact was with Roberts.  While
    I am not certain what time period the trial judge had in mind when he referred
    to the “course of the conspiracy”, Niemi was in communication with Malanca
    in August 2001.  In any event, there is no requirement that a member of a
    conspiracy have contact with more than one other member.  Again, the limiting
    of communications among its members may be regarded as an expected characteristic
    of a conspiracy to import drugs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fourth factor cited by the trial judge was that Niemi’s contact with Roberts
    was generally initiated by Roberts, and that Niemi’s efforts to contact Roberts
    were completely ignored from September 19 until just before the October 13
    trip.  In addition, the trial judge noted that there was no evidence of contact
    between Niemi and Roberts from October 17 until November 1 when Roberts,
    acting independently of Malanca, decided that Niemi should pilot the flight
    out of Jamaica.  I fail to see how these observations support a finding that
    Niemi was not part of the conspiracy.  There is no reason to expect that
    the principals of the conspiracy would be in continuous communication with
    Niemi.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifth,
    the trial judge observed that Niemi was not a contributor to the planning
    of the alleged importation, though he did assist in planning the flight back
    to Canada.  I am unclear as to the distinction between the “alleged importation” and
    the
    “planning of the flight back to Canada”.  Regardless, there is no requirement
    that a particular member of the conspiracy be involved in any particular
    step in the plan or in any planning at all.  Even without the evidence that
    Niemi, prior to his departure from Canada, left written instructions for
    Roy to meet the plane at the junction of the runway and the 6th Line and
    the evidence of Niemi’s telephone call to Roy on November 6, 2001 telling
    him that there were two people and their bags to be picked up, this factor
    provides no support for finding that Niemi was not part of the conspiracy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge considered that Niemi was “in no way an essential component
    to the criminal scheme alleged”.  He said that if Patrick Two had piloted
    the flight, Niemi would not have been part of the completed offence.  As
    I see it, whether Niemi was an essential component of the criminal scheme
    is irrelevant to whether he was a member of the conspiracy.  The telephone
    communications between Roberts and Malanca indicate they may have had three
    pilots potentially available to them.  None of the pilots would be essential,
    yet all of them may have been members of the conspiracy.</p>

line-height:normal'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary, I do not consider the six factors, regarded individually or cumulatively,
    to be relevant in determining whether Niemi was part of the conspiracy.</p>
  <h5 align=left style='text-align:left'>Niemi’s Knowledge</h5>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s view was that Niemi acted not with the intention of importing
    drugs, but of pursuing lucrative flying contracts with Roberts.  Niemi’s
    pursuit of lucrative flying contracts extended to the point of flying an
    individual who was on parole out of Canada and devising a plan to fly him
    back and gain his entry into Canada.  The trial judge found that there was
    no evidence that Niemi had any knowledge up to the time of his arrival in
    Jamaica on November 6, 2001, that the intention was for him to bring drugs
    back into Canada.  The trial judge observed that the evidence, for example
    the written instructions that Niemi left with Roy before he departed, was
    more consistent with a plan to smuggle Villareul back into Canada than a
    plan to import a volume of drugs that could not fit into Roy’s Corvette.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    record provides support for the trial judge’s view that Niemi went to Jamaica
    on the understanding that he would be smuggling Villareul back into Canada
    and nothing more, and such a finding was certainly open to him.  However,
    the trial judge arrived at this conclusion regarding Niemi’s state of mind
    having excluded Niemi’s own incriminating statements, which were admissible,
    and evidence that Niemi was a member of the broad conspiracy alleged.  His
    finding that Niemi was not a member of the conspiracy and that, therefore,
    the statements of the alleged co-conspirators were inadmissible, is undermined
    by his failure to consider Niemi’s own statements, and by his reliance on
    irrelevant factors.  These errors taint the trial judge’s conclusion as to
    Niemi’s state of mind, thereby making a new trial necessary.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>Wilful Blindness</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    his finding that Niemi intended, on November 6, simply to go to Jamaica and
    return with passengers, the trial judge concluded that the Crown had not
    proven that Niemi had actual knowledge that he was transporting illicit drugs.  He
    then turned to the question of whether Niemi acted in a wilfully blind manner.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Niemi
    gave his keys to the plane to Roberts at their meeting on the night of November
    6.  On the morning of November 7, Niemi discovered bags on the plane, and
    saw his passengers carrying more bags to the plane.  The trial judge found
    that Niemi’s suspicions were aroused and that if Niemi had deliberately refrained
    from making further inquiries because he wished to remain in ignorance, he
    would be deemed to have knowledge of what was in the bags.  The judge observed
    that it was obvious that Niemi’s suspicions were raised in fact because he
    asked, “[w]hose bags are these?”  Sousa responded,
    “[d]on’t worry, just do as you are told.”<a

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge dealt with this evidence in the following way:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>Niemi did make an inquiry but having received the response he did, his
    lack of further inquiry must not be a function of a desire to avoid knowledge.  I
    am satisfied that if he had wished to avoid knowledge he would not have asked
    about the bags in the first place.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>On the evidence
    in this case, although I am suspicious of the failure to inquire further,
    I have a doubt that he wanted to avoid knowing and rather the failure to
    make further inquiries was a function of the effective inability to make
    further inquiries.  He obviously was being placed in a position of confrontation
    by Sousa having experienced the events in Roberts’ room, and was thereby
    effectively rendered unable to make further inquiries without potential jeopardy
    to himself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no doubt that Niemi subjectively had a suspicion that the hockey bags
    contained illegal drugs.  He says so in his statement to the police.  He
    said the movie “Midnight Express” (which involves drug smuggling) sprang
    to his mind when he saw the bags.  He explained to the police, “[s]o I’m
    just, you know, blinders”.  The trial judge seems to have found Niemi was
    fixed with the duty to inquire when he said, “[h]owever, upon discovering
    the bags in the plane prior to takeoff and seeing the passengers carrying
    more bags to the plane, he had an obligation to inquire when he knew there
    was reason for inquiry.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent conceded that the circumstances were such that there was an obligation
    on Niemi to make an inquiry, but argued that his failure to make further
    inquiries was not tantamount to wilful blindness.  The trial judge correctly
    proceeded on the basis that even though Niemi made an inquiry the question
    remained, after that inquiry, whether he still harboured a real suspicion
    and refrained from making additional inquiries because he preferred to remain
    deliberately ignorant of the truth: <i>R. v. Lagace</i> (2003), 181.C.C.C.
    (3d) 12.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Certainly
    the response, “[d]on’t worry, just do as you are told” would have done nothing
    to dispel Niemi’s suspicions.  If anything, the response would raise his
    suspicions.  However, the trial judge found that Niemi’s failure to make
    further inquiry was not a function of a desire to avoid knowledge.  Rather,
    he found that Niemi failed to make an additional inquiry because he would
    be placed in potential jeopardy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    reaching this conclusion, the trial judge seems not to have considered the
    findings he made when he dealt with the defence of duress.  In dealing with
    duress, the trial judge observed that there was no direct evidence of Niemi’s
    subjective feelings of jeopardy and fear.  He had noted that while Niemi
    referred to the movie “Midnight Express” in his statement to the police,
    he did not indicate to the police that he had been the recipient of any threats.  The
    trial judge also observed that Niemi had bargained back-and-forth with Roberts
    even after Roberts had shown his gun and the picture of a house that resembled
    Niemi’s.  There was no clear specific evidence of duress before the court;
    rather, the court had only Ross’ interpretation of what had transpired.  Ross
    had heard only part of the conversation and did not give any evidence of
    words or threats being used or heard.  Niemi had successfully held his ground
    and Roberts had backed down on his stated intention to hold Ross as hostage.  The
    trial judge noted that after the meeting with Roberts, Niemi did not conduct
    himself in the manner expected of a person facing serious threats.  The trial
    judge indicated it would be reasonable to infer that Niemi and Ross would
    not simply have gone to bed without further discussion if serious threats
    had been made during the meeting with Roberts.  Finally, Niemi had not adopted
    the attitude of a person under severe distress in his statement to the police
    and did not take up the opportunity to tell the police he had been subject
    to any threats.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    were only some of the reasons upon which the trial judge concluded “there
    is insufficient evidence to support that [Niemi] was under duress <u>when
    he left Montego Bay</u>” [emphasis added].  These findings are relevant to
    Niemi’s state of mind as he sat on the runway at the airport of Montego Bay
    after Sousa told him not to worry about the suspicious bags, but to just
    do as he was told.  The trial judge does not explain how the events that
    Niemi experienced in Roberts’ room the night before could give rise to legitimate
    feelings that making further inquiry would place him in
    “potential jeopardy” when those same events did not give rise to a legitimate
    fear for his safety if he refused to fly the plane.  If anything, Niemi’s
    feelings of jeopardy after Sousa’s response would be reduced because Roberts,
    who possessed the gun and allegedly made the threats the night before, was
    not at the airport on the next morning when Niemi flew the plane from Jamaica.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown submits that the facts found by the trial judge in analysing the duress
    issue would support a conviction if applied to the wilful blindness analysis.  That
    may be, but it is not the function of this court to choose between the trial
    judge’s findings on the duress issue and his finding of fact that further
    inquiry would have placed Niemi in jeopardy.  In my view, the logical incompatibility
    of the trial judge’s findings on duress and wilful blindness require a new
    trial.</p>
