  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    appeals involve a motor vehicle accident, which occurred on September 13,
    1996, at approximately 2:15 a.m. in the City of Hamilton. Earlier that night
    Andrea McIntyre (hereafter referred to as “Andrea”), a first year student
    at McMaster University, had attended a campus bar operated by McMaster Student
    Union Incorporated (hereafter referred to as “McMaster”) known as “The Downstairs
    John”. Andrea was walking home with her friends when she was struck and injured
    by a motor vehicle owned by Thomas Grigg and operated by Andrew Grigg.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Andrew
    Grigg had also consumed alcohol at “The Downstairs John” shortly before the
    accident. It was alleged in the action against McMaster that Andrew Grigg
    was either over-served by McMaster or served while apparently intoxicated.</p>
  <p class=headingtitle><b>B.        THE FACTS</b></p>
  <p class=headingsubtitle><span lang=EN-US>(a)       The Accident</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    September 13, 1996, Andrea and several of her friends were walking along
    the curb of Forsythe Avenue in Hamilton, Ontario after leaving the McMaster
    pub when the vehicle operated by an impaired driver, Andrew Grigg, struck
    her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time, Andrew Grigg was a Hamilton Tiger-Cat football player. After a
    football practice, he had attended at two drinking establishments, Kelsey’s
    and the Crowbar, before ending up at the Downstairs John with some his friends.
    After he left, one of his passengers realized that she had forgotten her
    purse, and so he began driving back to the pub. At the corner of King Street
    and Forsythe Avenue, Andrew Grigg failed to stop his vehicle at the stop
    sign and made a reckless wide right-hand turn to proceed northbound on Forsythe
    Avenue. The vehicle sheared off a lamp post and struck Andrea. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Numerous
    witnesses testified at trial that Andrew Grigg was speeding and that he took
    no evasive measures such as braking or turning before hitting Andrea. He
    testified that he did not see Andrea or any of her friends before the accident
    and he admitted that even if Andrea had been on the sidewalk, instead of
    walking along the curb, his vehicle would still have collided with her. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Andrew
    Grigg failed a breathalyser test shortly after the accident. At trial, testimony
    indicated that his blood alcohol level was two to three times over the legal
    limit. He was initially charged with “operating a motor vehicle, having consumed
    alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration in the person’s blood exceeds
    80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood” in contravention of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i>. Later, counts of “impaired driving causing bodily
    harm” and the “operation of a motor vehicle in a manner dangerous to the
    public causing bodily harm” were added.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ultimately,
    the Crown Attorney decided to proceed only with a charge of careless driving
    and withdrew the other charges. The prosecution made this decision because
    before the breathalyser test was administered, Andrew Grigg had not been
    informed of his right to counsel. The Crown Attorney testified at the trial
    that had Andrew Grigg been convicted, he would have asked for and would have
    expected that Andrew Grigg would have received a period of incarceration.
    Andrew Grigg pled guilty to careless driving and received a fine of $500.
    No license suspension was imposed. </p>
  <p class=headingsubtitle><span lang=EN-US>(b)       The Injuries Sustained
      by Andrea McIntyre</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time of accident, Andrea was a first-year student at McMaster University
    and was an outstanding athlete. Among her many athletic interests, she was
    exceptionally passionate about rugby and played on the intercollegiate team.
    Andrea’s former teachers and coaches described her as
    “very positive”, “easy to coach”, and “a very skilled athlete” with “a great
    disposition”. She intended to pursue a post-secondary degree with the goal
    of becoming a chiropractor. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a result of the accident, Andrea suffered both physical and psychological
    injuries. Her physical injuries included a closed head injury, soft tissue
    and orthopaedic injuries. The primary orthopaedic injury was a comminuted
    fracture of her right femur. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Six
    years after the accident, Andrea was still suffering from lower back pain,
    right lateral thigh numbness, numbness on the inner aspect of her thigh,
    right knee discomfort with locking, right ankle and lower shin discomfort
    and right large toe pain. At the time of the trial she also had a reduced
    range of motion in her right hip, her right hemi-pelvis is tipped down (potentially
    the cause of her back pain), and she has permanent scarring in two places
    on her right leg. She also has a very probable increased risk of arthritis
    in her hip, right knee, foot and ankle. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Andrea’s
    physical injuries are such that she will never be able to resume the level
    of athletic activity and competitive skill that she had demonstrated prior
    to the accident. She testified that this has had a
    “devastating” effect on her given the importance of athletics in her life. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
    Andrea has also suffered serious psychological injury, which one medical
    expert testified was the result of mild brain trauma. As a result, she has
    had problems with depression, most notably two major depressive episodes
    during which she attempted suicide. During the first episode on October 21,
    1996, Andrea became psychotic, delusional, and required hospitalization.
    She was diagnosed as having a major depressive episode and had become catatonic
    with severe psychomotor retardation. She also believed that her family was
    being hunted or persecuted in some manner. In the opinion of one psychiatrist,
    when Andrea’s sister Jennifer had a motor vehicle accident, it led Andrea
    to attempt suicide so that the “hunt” would be over. All of the expert psychiatric
    evidence at the trial confirmed that Andrea’s depression leading to the suicide
    attempt was accident-related. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was a second suicide attempt by Andrea in 2000, which medical testimony called
    on her behalf also attributed to the accident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several
    of the medical experts expressed the opinion that there is a significant
    instance of recurrence for persons who have suffered major depressive episodes.
    One expert testified that individuals such as Andrea who have had two episodes
    have a 70 per cent chance of having a third episode and individuals who have
    had three episodes have a 90 per cent chance of having a fourth. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    order to attempt to prevent a recurrence of serious depression, Andrea has
    been advised to remain on medication for the rest of her life and several
    of the medical experts testified that she should continue psychiatric counselling
    as well. Andrea testified that the thought of any recurrence of her depression
    is “just so terrifying” and that she fears her depression may affect her
    ability to get married and have a family. She also testified that she has
    ongoing battles with anxiety and as such, has had to limit her career choices
    to accommodate both her physical injuries and her inability to handle stress.
    A psychiatrist testified that he shared this concern and expressed the opinion
    that Andrea will have to tailor her lifestyle to minimize anxiety and stress,
    in an attempt to prevent her depression from recurring. <span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New Roman"'>An
    economist also testified that Andrea has suffered a reduction in lifetime
    earning potential as a result of the accident.</span></p>

    liability was a matter of absolute liability rather than negligence and,
    further, he erred because there was no evidence Andrew Grigg was either over-served
    at the Pub or served while apparently intoxicated. In addition, McMaster

    Ontario, commercial host liability may be imposed both at common law and
    by statute where a patron, who subsequently causes injury, has been served
    while intoxicated or over-served to the point of intoxication, and where
    it is reasonably foreseeable that the patron will drive a motor vehicle upon
    leaving the establishment. Commercial vendors of alcohol have an obligation
    to monitor a patron’s consumption of alcohol and should have protocols in
    place to ensure that all reasonable precautions are taken to prevent such
    patrons who subsequently drive from becoming intoxicated to the point where
    they cannot safely operate a motor vehicle. Moreover, a commercial host does
    not escape liability simply by <i>not knowing</i> that the patron became
    inebriated before driving; the commercial host is liable if it or its employees <i>knew
    or ought reasonably to have known</i> in the circumstances that the patron
    was in such a condition. See <i>Stewart v. Pettie</i>, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 131; <i>Childs
    v. Desmoreaux</i> (2004), 71 O.R. (3d) 195 (C.A.), at paras. 52, 55, 66 and

    compensation for the injury or damage from the person who or whose employee

'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>McMaster
    alleges that the trial judge erred by instructing the jury that liability
    under s. 39 is “absolute” without telling them about the necessary “fault” or
    negligence component of such liability. We do not read the trial judge’s
    charge in that fashion. In our view, the trial judge carefully and properly
    instructed the jury on the issue of the taverner’s liability. In this regard,
    the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>At common law commercial vendors of alcohol owe
    a general duty of care to persons who might reasonably be expected to come
    into contact with an intoxicated person and to whom the patron may pose some
    risk. That duty of care arises if there is some foreseeable risk of harm
    to the patron or to the third party.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Society has also provided guidelines for the standard
    of care in the provisions of the Ontario <i>Liquor Licence Act</i> [citation
    omitted]. Given that catastrophic injuries can result from operation of a
    motor vehicle by an inebriated person, a high standard is imposed on commercial
    establishments which supply alcohol. This it to ensure that they do not create
    a danger to users of the highway. The Ontario<i> Liquor Licence Act</i> imposes
    liability as a result of findings of fact in its relevant parts as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[The trial judge then read to the jury the relevant
    portions of s. 39 of the Act as outlined above, and continued:]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Common law and statutory law therefore impose a
    duty on taverns to its patrons and others to ensure that the tavern does
    not serve alcohol which would either intoxicate or increase the patron’s
    intoxication. They do not escape liability simply because a patron does not
    exhibit any visible signs of intoxication if in the circumstances the tavern
    knew or ought to have known that the patron was becoming intoxicated. Likewise,
    commercial vendors of alcohol cannot avoid liability where the establishment
    has intentionally structured the environment in such a way as to make it
    impossible to know whether intervention is necessary. This therefore imposes
    a very high or heavy responsibility upon owners and managers of drinking
    establishments.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A tavern’s standards are too low if drinks are
    only refused if a patron exhibits signs of impairment such as being too loud,
    starting arguments, knocking over drinks, falling down, creating problems
    for the staff, or upsetting other patrons. Taverns have a duty also to take
    affirmative action to prevent intoxicated patrons from driving. In circumstances
    where it is reasonable to expect that a patron has come by car, there is
    a heavier duty on the tavern staff to keep an eye on the patron when they
    depart to check to see if the patron is driving and to arrange safe transportation,
    if necessary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    regard to the provisions of the Act and to the common law as established
    by the Supreme Court of Canada and in this court, we see no error in this
    direction. The trial judge does not use the term “absolute liability” (although
    he may have expressed the view during pre-charge submissions by counsel that
    the statutory provision involved absolute liability). While that expression
    has been used in conjunction with a predecessor to s. 39 in the context of
    the notion of causation – see <i>Hague v. Billings</i> (1993), 13 O.R. (3d)
    298 (C.A.) – it is more accurate to characterize the liability under s. 39
    as a statutory liability arising once the factual pre-conditions provided
    for therein have been found to exist. That is what the trial judge instructed
    the jury was the case in this instance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In

    reject McMaster’s submission that there was insufficient evidence to support
    these findings. In this respect, McMaster relies upon the evidence indicating
    that Andrew Grigg had an unusual capacity to display little sign of intoxication,
    in spite of significant blood alcohol levels, and that there were no visible
    signals of intoxication on his part before or after the accident. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Amongst
    other things, this evidence included the testimony of Susan Board, a McMaster
    employee, who said that she shook hands with Andrew Grigg when he entered
    the Pub at about 12:30 a.m., watched him walk down the stairs with no difficulty,
    and did not notice a whisp of alcohol on his breath at the time. Ms. Board’s
    evidence was that she observed Andrew Grigg before he left the Pub and had
    no concerns about signs of intoxication. Further, with the exception of the
    evidence of one witness, Gwen Farrell, no other witnesses were able to provide
    any indication that he was showing apparent signs of impairment, other than
    the smell of alcohol on his breath. These witnesses included the police officers
    who attended the scene and took Andrew Grigg into custody, as well as at
    least one witness who had seen him in the Pub, and several persons who were
    accompanying Andrea at the time of the accident. In addition, the two expert
    witnesses who observed the video that was taken when the breathalyser test
    was administered approximately two hours after the event acknowledged that
    Andrew Grigg displayed no outward signs of intoxication.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    spite of the foregoing testimony, however, there was evidence upon which
    the members of the jury were entitled to make the findings they made. First,
    Gwen Farrell, who was herself admittedly quite intoxicated at the time and
    who observed Andrew Grigg just after the accident, thought he was intoxicated. <span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New Roman"'>Ms.
    Farrell testified that he was stumbling, he was weaving back and forth, he
    looked kind of “spacey,” and he smelled of alcohol. Notwi</span>thstanding
    the obvious frailties of her testimony, it was open to the jury to accept
    it. Second, there was evidence that McMaster’s “Smart Serve” protocols – designed
    to minimize the risk of patrons becoming intoxicated – were not followed.
    Finally, there was the evidence of Andrew Grigg’s blood alcohol level and
    expert testimony to the effect that at those levels he would have shown visible
    signs of impairment before leaving the Pub.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    breathalyser results demonstrated that Andrew Grigg’s blood alcohol level
    was 178 and 174 milligrams/100 millilitres of blood two hours after the accident.
    Significantly, the experts were all consistent in their testimony that at
    the time of the accident his blood alcohol level would have been around 218
    milligrams of alcohol/100 millilitres of blood – nearly three times the legal
    limit. In the opinion of the plaintiffs’ expert, Professor Kalant, there
    was “no conceivable way” that Andrew Grigg had consumed only the six drinks
    over the entire night that he claimed to have consumed. Moreover, if the
    jury accepted that Andrew Grigg had consumed only the three beers he claimed
    to have had prior to arrival, and showed no signs of impairment on arrival
    (as Ms. Board testified), it is possible (given his tolerance and blood alcohol
    levels) that he was served up to eighteen drinks at the Pub – a rate of approximately
    eight one-ounce drinks per hour. Dr.&nbsp;Kalant testified that, if such
    were the case, Andrew Grigg would have been “very drunk” and he would have
    been “visibly impaired at the time of the accident”. Dr. Kalant had “no doubt
    whatsoever” that, to someone trained to detect the effects of the consumption
    of alcohol on persons leaving a bar, the signs of whether the person leaving
    was capable of driving an automobile safely would have been apparent. It
    was his opinion that the employees of the Pub should have been able to observe
    Andrew Grigg for impairment. McMaster called no evidence from any employees
    other than Ms. Board, or from the companions of Andrew Grigg at the time,
    to refute the opinion of Dr. Kalant that he would have been showing signs
    of impairment when he left the Pub. </p>

    complains that the trial was unfair because the plaintiffs called and relied
    upon “similar fact” evidence not disclosed prior to trial and that the trial
    judge failed to charge the jury on the proper use of that evidence. This
    evidence consisted of the testimony of a number of individuals who frequented
    the Pub and who testified that they occasionally had been served, and had
    observed others being served, to the point of intoxication in spite of the “Smart
    Serve” protocol. These instances were said to have occurred before, on, and
    after the night in question. We agree with the respondent that the evidence
    was not “similar fact” evidence called to buttress the claim for punitive
    damages, but rather evidence led to rebut McMaster’s position that the Pub
    had policies and procedures in effect such that it would not over-serve alcohol
    to its patrons. There was therefore no need for the trial judge to instruct
    the jury on the limited use to which similar fact evidence may be put. We
    see no reason to interfere with the trial judge’s decision to admit such
    evidence in the circumstances.<b>        </b></p>

    the Pub was following its own procedures, in spite of the judge’s ruling
    that no comments ought to be made in the addresses about adverse inferences.
    Counsel for the plaintiffs was entitled to comment on the submissions of
    counsel for McMaster that everything had been done properly, when no evidence

    jury apportioned liability 70 per cent to the Grigg Appellants and 30 per
    cent to McMaster. McMaster contests this finding, arguing that the charge
    to the jury contained no instructions with respect to liability and that
    the trial judge should have told the jury – as some other judges have done – that
    in circumstances such as the case at bar “the lion’s share of culpability,
    both morally and legally, should attach to the drinking driver”: <i>Dryden
    (Litigation Guardian of) v. Campbell Estate</i>, (2001), 11 M.V.R. (4th)
    247 at para. 215 (Ont. S.C.J.). See also <i>Hague v. Billings, supra</i>,
    at 303. It also submits that the jury’s finding was not in keeping with findings
    on proportionate liability as established in those cases. McMaster’s counsel
    repeatedly requested a charge on apportionment, but to no avail.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
      it may have been preferable had the trial judge acceded to this request,
      we see no basis for interfering with the jury’s findings respecting the
      apportionment of liability. Just as a jury award assessing the degree of
      contributory negligence is to be approached in the same way as a jury verdict
      respecting damages generally – see <i>Snushall v. Fulsangi</i> (2005),
      78 O.R. (3d) 142 at paras. 19-22 (C.A.) – so too is a jury award assessing
      the degree of apportionment of damages as between defendants. In the absence
      of material misdirection or non-direction, appellate courts will not interfere
      unless the verdict is so plainly unreasonable and unjust as to satisfy
      the court that no jury reviewing the evidence as a whole and acting judicially
      could have arrived at that conclusion: <i>McLean v. McConnell</i>, [1937]
      S.C.R. 341; <i>Olmstead v. Vancouver-Fraser Park District</i>, [1975] 2
      S.C.R. 831; <i>Ferenczy v. MCI Medical Clinics</i> (2005), 198 O.A.C. 254
      (C.A.); <i>Snushall v. Fulsang</i>, <i>supra</i>. See also <i>Mizzi v.
      Hopkins</i> (2003), 64 O.R. (3d) 365 at para. 52 (C.A.). Some courts have
      suggested that an appellate court may conclude the damages awarded are
      inordinately high or low if it takes the view that they are too high or
      too low by 50 per cent: <i>Howes v. Crosby</i> (1984), 45 O.R. (2d) 449
  (C.A.); <i>Koukounakis v. Stainrod</i> (1995) 23 O.R. (3d) 299 (C.A.).</p>

'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jury’s apportionment of damages as between the Grigg Appellants (70 per cent)
    and McMaster (30 per cent) cannot be said to fall into that category. Although
    the trial judge did not charge the jury on apportionment, in fact the jury
    did attribute the “lion’s share” of responsibility to Andrew Grigg, thus
    reflecting his significant moral blameworthiness for the accident. Moreover,
    the apportionment – while perhaps at the high end – is not out of the range
    of findings in other cases involving commercial host liability: see, for
    example, <i>Hague v. Billings, supra</i> (driver 85 per cent; tavern 15 per
    cent); <i>Sambell v. Hudago Enterprises Limited</i>, [1990] O.J. No. 2494
    (Gen. Div.) (driver 71.5 percent; tavern 28.5 per cent); <i>Francescucci
    v. Gilker</i>, [1996] O.J. No. 474 (C.A.) (driver 22 per cent/tavern 78 per
    cent). In the seminal case involving commercial host liability for damages
    suffered by a patron who had been permitted to become intoxicated and then
    to leave the establishment to walk home on a busy roadway, the Supreme Court
    of Canada upheld an apportionment of 30% as against the tavern: <i>Menow
    v. Jordan House Ltd.</i>, [1974] S.C.R. 239. Thus, the jury was entitled,
    on the record before it, to arrive at the verdict regarding apportionment
    that it did.</p>

    evidence was not sufficient to establish that Andrea’s psychological harm

    Even if it could be said that aggravated damages were properly awarded as
    being supported by the evidence, such damages are part of the general non-pecuniary
    award and subject to the upper limit for personal injury set by the Trilogy.
    In our view, given that the upper limit at the time of the trial was $299,000,
    the jury award of $250,000 for general non-pecuniary damages was generous
    and should not be increased even if there is an evidentiary basis for awarding

    on the part of the defendant.” <i>Whiten v. Pilot Insurance Co.</i>, [2002]

    injury, or harm to the plaintiff’s feelings. In <i>Norberg v. Wynrib</i>,
    [1992] 2 S.C.R. 226, the Supreme Court of Canada awarded both aggravated
    and punitive damages against the defendant doctor who exchanged painkillers
    for sexual favours from the drug-addicted plaintiff. At 263, the majority
    found that aggravated damages are awarded if the tort, in that case a battery,
    occurred in humiliating or undignified circumstances. Aggravated damages
    are not awarded in addition to general damages, but the general damages are
    to be assessed “taking into account any aggravating features of the case
    and to that extent increasing the amount awarded.”</p>

    or oppressive manner, and thus there is no basis upon which the jury could
    have properly awarded punitive damages. <span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New Roman"'>We disagree. In <i>Norberg
    v. Wynrib, supra, </i>Laforest J., writing for the majority, observed at
    268 that the conduct of Dr. Wynrib, a doctor who prescribed drugs to Norberg
    in return for sexual favours, was not harsh, vindictive or malicious, to
    use the terms cited in <i>Vorvis v. Insurance Company of British Columbia,
    [1989] 1S.C.R. 1085. </i>Nevertheless, the doctor’s conduct was reprehensible;
    it offended the ordinary standards of decent conduct in the community and
    LaForest J. was 
    of the opinion that an award of punitive damages was appropriate. The type
    of conduct in which Dr. Wynrib engaged cried out for deterrence. In a separate
    opinion,<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span

    making the deliberate choice to drink excessively and then drive, Andrew
    Grigg’s misconduct was more than mere negligence. It demonstrated a conscious
    and reckless disregard for the lives and safety of others. There was evidence
    he was two to three times over the legal limit for alcohol consumption and
    was speeding and driving recklessly. In our view, this was sufficient evidence
    for the jury to find that an award of punitive damages was warranted. The
    Appellants Grigg also argued an award of punitive damages would be inappropriate
    and unnecessary given that the driver Grigg had already been punished, <i>i.e.</i> a
    $500 fine for careless driving. In our view, analyzing the principles articulated
    by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Whiten</i>, and given the fact that
    the misconduct in question was much more serious than careless driving, it
    was open to the jury to find that <span style='font-family:&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;

    we agree with the Appellant’s submission that the quantum of punitive damages
    was too high to meet the rationality test. The quantum must be proportionate
    in relation to several dimensions, none of which would support the high award

    nature and character of the wide range of descriptors suggest that punitive
    damages would only be justified in the most extreme cases. Punitive damages
    are designed to express the repugnance of the public, which is represented
    by the jury, towards the outrageous and heinous conduct of the defendant.
    As Cory J. stated in <i>Hill</i> at para. 196, punitive damages are “the
    means by which the jury or judge expresses its outrage at the egregious conduct
    of the defendant.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, negligent conduct can only attract punitive damages if the misconduct
    in question was intentional and deliberate and was
    “extreme in nature and such that by any reasonable standard it is deserving
    of full condemnation and punishment.” See <i>Vorvis</i> at 1108. This requirement
    for deliberate action or omission is clear from the relatively few cases
    in which courts have awarded punitive damages for negligent conduct. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    example, in <i>Gerula v. Flores</i>, <i>supra</i>, this Court found the trial
    judge erred in not awarding punitive damages against the defendant doctor
    who had operated on the plaintiff’s wrong spinal disc. After the operation
    the doctor discovered the error, he failed to inform the defendant, altered
    his notes to cover up his error and persuaded the plaintiff to consent to
    further surgery to correct his mistake. At para. 72, Weiler J.A. found that
    the doctor’s conduct was more than mere negligence because of his “<i>deliberate
    non-disclosure</i>” of his error. [Emphasis added.]</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Weiler
    J.A. further found that this non-disclosure represented a misrepresentation
    by omission and that a reasonable person in the position of the Appellant
    would not have chosen to have the same doctor perform the second surgery,
    had he known about the error and subsequent non-disclosure. Such conduct
    demonstrates a “deliberate and flagrant disregard” of the plaintiff’s rights.
    Weiler J.A. also noted that the doctor’s “highly unethical conduct and disregard” of
    the plaintiff’s rights <i>had gone unpunished</i>. As such it was an appropriate
    case to make an award of punitive damages.</p>

    Canadian decisions outside of Ontario, the negligence actions in which punitive
    damages have been awarded have all required intentional or deliberate conduct.
    In <i>Robitaille, supra</i>, punitive damages were awarded against a professional
    hockey club that was negligent in failing to subject the plaintiff to thorough
    medical examinations after he sustained an injury, and then ordering him
    to play in subsequent games. This intentional conduct of the Club “showed
    a callous disregard for his feelings and his well-being – they ignored the
    dictates of common decency as well as commonsense.” (at 248). The British
    Columbia Court of Appeal held that punitive damages were available in negligence
    cases where the “defendant has done more than inflict injury on others by
    his negligence or intentional acts.”
    (at 250). The court further held that the defendant must have acted with
    malice, or with recklessness that indicates an indifference to the safety
    of others, or alternatively engaged in conduct that is so socially reprehensible
    that it justifies the award of punitive damages. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several
    courts have rejected claims for punitive damages in negligence cases on the
    basis that the defendant’s misconduct was not specifically directed at the
    plaintiff. For example, in <i>Kaytor v. Lion’s Driving Range Ltd</i>. (1962),
    35 D.L.R. (2d) 426 (B.C.S.C.), the owners of a driving range kept an extremely
    vicious dog on site to prevent people from stealing golf balls at night.
    The dog become loose accidentally and injured the plaintiff. The trial judge
    found at 431 that the defendants were negligent but held that to award punitive
    damages, the act complained of must be intentionally directed to the person
    or property injured. Similarly, in <i>Nichols v. Guiel</i> (1983), 145 D.L.R.
    (3d) 186 (B.C.S.C.) the trial judge refused to award punitive damages for
    a motor vehicle accident that had injured the plaintiff and killed her husband.
    The defendant was accused of racing on the wrong side of the highway at a
    speed of 100 m.p.h. or more. The trial judge, relying on <i>Kaytor</i>, <i>supra</i>, found
    that the conduct of the defendant, although deliberately reckless, was not
    specifically directed at the plaintiff or her late husband and that this
    precluded an award of punitive damages. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the end of the trial, during the motion to strike the claim for punitive
    damages, the Appellants Grigg argued that an award of punitive damages required
    the defendant’s conduct to be specifically directed at the plaintiff. We
    disagree with this submission and with the reasoning in both <i>Kaytor</i>, <i>supra</i> and <i>Nichols</i>, <i>supra</i> insofar
    as they would require the misconduct to be deliberately directed at the injured
    party.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Such
    a requirement could well bar punitive damages in product liability cases,
    where punitive damages may be awarded depending on the level of indifference
    or recklessness of the defendant. See for example <i>Van Oirschot v. Dow
    Chemical Canada Inc</i>. (1993), 142 A.R. 149 (Q.B.), affirmed (1995), 174
    A.R. 157 (C.A.). In that case, the defendant was aware of the dangers with
    respect to the product and did not provide appropriate warnings to its customers.
    The trial judge found the defendant had acted in a high-handed and oppressive
    manner. The Court of Appeal found that the $10,000 awarded by the trial judge
    for “high-handed conduct” was an appropriate award for punitive damages. </p>

  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>While negligence or an intentional act, can trigger

    that might flow therefrom, including the welfare and safety of others. <i>In
    other words, intention to cause the injury need not be present; it will suffice
    if there was an intention to do the act which eventually caused the injury.</i> The

    our view, the evidence before the jury was sufficient to meet the requirements
    that Andrew Grigg’s conduct was deliberate and intentional. His decision
    to drink excessively and drive, his intoxication, and the evidence that he
    was speeding and driving erratically were key contributors to the cause of
    the accident. All of these factors demonstrate that on that night, Andrew
    Grigg showed a conscious and reckless disregard for the lives and safety
    of others. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the Appellants Grigg argued that punitive damages would be inappropriate
    in this case, as Andrew Grigg’s conduct had already been punished by his
    conviction for careless driving and the imposition of a $500 fine. We agree
    that a factor of significant importance in assessing whether it would be
    appropriate to award punitive damages is whether punishment has already been
    imposed in a separate proceeding for the same misconduct. Binnie J. noted
    at para. 69 in <i>Whiten</i>, <i>supra</i>, that the Ontario Law Reform Commission,
    in its <i>Report on Exemplary Damages </i>(Toronto: The Commission, 1991)
    had recommended that the “court should be entitled to consider the fact and
    adequacy of any prior penalty imposed in any criminal or other similar proceeding
    brought against the defendant” (at 46). At para. 123 of <i>Whiten</i>, Binnie
    J. made the following comments:</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>In Canada, unlike
      some other common law jurisdictions, such “other”
    punishment is relevant but it is not necessarily a bar to the award of punitive
    damages. <i>The prescribed fine, for example, may be disproportionately small
    to the level of outrage the jury wishes to express. The misconduct in question
    may be broader than the misconduct proven in evidence in the criminal or
    regulatory proceeding.</i> The legislative judgment fixing the amount of
    the potential fine may be based on policy considerations other than pure
    punishment. The key point is that punitive damages are awarded “if, but only
    if” all other penalties have been taken into account and found to be inadequate
    to accomplish the objectives of retribution, deterrence, and denunciation.

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    this statement of Binnie J. might appear to be obiter in the context of the
    issues to be determined in <i>Whiten,</i> we are of the view that we are
    bound his observations. In <i>R. v. Henry</i>, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 609 at paras.
    53-57, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the closer the relationship
    between the obiter and the legal issue in question, the more likely the obiter
    is binding. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the purposes of this appeal we regard Binnie J.’s comments in <i>Whiten</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    as authoritative and binding. In <i>Whiten</i>, the entire case focused both
    on the circumstances in which punitive damages would be available, and more
    importantly the factors to be considered in assessing the proportionality
    of the damages. In both this appeal and in <i>Whiten</i>, the jury’s assessment
    of punitive damages was a central issue. <span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New Roman"'>In <i>Whiten</i>, the
    intervener, the Insurance Council or Canada, argued that discipline of insurance
    companies should be left to the regulator; Binnie J. rejected this argument
    at para. 123, noting that the regulator had not taken an interest in that
    case prior to the jury’s award of punitive damages.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
      the driver Grigg pleaded guilty to, and received a fine for, careless driving,
      the evidence in the civil trial established that he was significantly impaired
      and that his conduct should normally warrant a serious punishment. Where
      a wrongdoer has already been punished for an offence and the same conduct
      is in question at a civil trial, punitive damages generally will not serve
      a rational purpose as the sentence imposed in the criminal or regulatory
      environment will have already met the necessary objectives of retribution,
      deterrence and denunciation. In our view, there are sound policy reasons
      for generally not attempting to re-try those proceedings in a civil action.
      As this court held in <i>Fleury v. Fleury</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 11:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Where tortious acts have
    already been sanctioned by the imposition of a criminal sentence, it is inappropriate
    to award punitive damages in a civil lawsuit. To do so is to punish twice
    for the same offence. Where, however, the civil proceedings establish that…the
    sentence does not fully sanction the tortfeasor’s behaviour... punitive damages
    may be awarded [footnotes omitted].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, a court in a civil proceeding should generally demonstrate deference
    to the decision of the other court. Otherwise, the review of the appropriateness
    of a penalty administered in a criminal court, for example, could be viewed
    as a collateral attack on that decision. In our opinion, the “disproportionality” test
    enunciated by Binnie J. in <i>Whiten</i> in relation to the wrongful conduct
    and the penalty imposed is one that should be approached with considerable
    caution.</p>

      believe that the facts in the present case present one of those rare instances
      where the disproportionality test applies. It was rational for the jury
      to conclude that punitive damages would denounce Andrew Grigg’s conduct
      and signal the need for general deterrence of impaired driving. Given Andrew
      Grigg’s fine of $500, punitive damages would not amount to double punishment,
      and indeed would be more appropriate punishment.</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    comparison to compensatory damages, courts have a much greater scope and
    discretion in reviewing the quantum of punitive damages. See <i>Hill v. Church
    of Scientology</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 197 and <i>Whiten</i>, <i>supra</i>, at
    paras. 100-01. The “rationality test” asks whether the misconduct of the
    defendant was so outrageous that punitive damages were rationally required
    to act as deterrence. See <i>Hill</i>, <i>ibid</i>. Both the award of punitive
    damages and the quantum must be rational. As discussed above, we believe
    the jury’s award of punitive damages was a rational response to the defendant’s
    deliberate misconduct, which resulted in serious injury to the plaintiff
    and which had only been punished in part. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Whiten</i>,
    the Supreme Court of Canada held that the proportionality of the quantum
    of damages must be examined in several dimensions. First, the quantum must
    be proportionate to the blameworthiness of the defendant’s conduct. See paras.
    112-13. While Andrew Grigg’s misconduct was <span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New Roman"'>reprehensible
    and recklessly disregarded the plaintiff’s rights, it was </span>apparently
    an isolated event. Furthermore, he did not flee the scene of the accident
    or profit from his misconduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the quantum must be proportionate to the degree of vulnerability of the plaintiff.
    See <i>Whiten</i> at paras. 114-16. In this case, there had not been a relationship
    between the parties where it could be submitted that there was an abuse of
    power over a vulnerable plaintiff. The plaintiff was most regrettably in
    the wrong place at the wrong time. <span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New Roman"'>However,
    a person who chooses to drive while impaired takes on an increased risk of
    injuring others who have no ability to adjust their behaviour to account
    for this increased risk. In this respect, impaired drivers increase the vulnerability
    of all users of the road, especially pedestrians. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the quantum must be proportionate to the harm or potential harm directed
    specifically at the plaintiff. See <i>Whiten</i> at para. 117. In this case,
    the harm was not directed specifically at the plaintiff and in our view,
    this is an important factor that militates towards a lower award.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    the quantum must be proportionate to the need for deterrence. See <i>Whiten</i> at
    paras. 118-22. While in <i>Whiten</i> this factor was considered in the context
    of a large and wealthy insurance company defendant profiting at the expense
    of a vulnerable plaintiff, there is also clearly a need for deterrence in
    impaired and reckless driving accidents. <span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New Roman"'>As La Forest J. stated
    at 267-68 and McLachlin J. stated at 300-301 in <i>Norberg v. Wynrib</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    egregiously blameworthy conduct that is prevalent in our society creates
    a consequent need for deterrence. The very fact that the conduct is prevalent
    merits a higher award of damages.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifth,
    the quantum must be proportionate, after taking into account the other penalties,
    both civil and criminal, which have been inflicted on the defendant for the
    same misconduct. See <i>Whiten</i> at para. 123. As previously discussed,
    while Andrew Grigg had already been punished for his conduct, having pleaded
    guilty to careless driving, it was open to the jury to determine that the
    punishment was inadequate and that an award of punitive damages was necessary
    to meet the objectives of retribution, deterrence, and denunciation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the jury award of $100,000 is not rational to meet the objectives
    of retribution, deterrence and denunciation. The lower level of moral blameworthiness
    given the isolated nature of the misconduct, the lack of a relationship between
    the parties (in comparison to a relationship of trust) and the fact that
    the misconduct was not specifically directed at the plaintiff, indicates
    that a lesser quantum of punitive damages would be rational. In light of
    this, as stated above, we would reduce the quantum awarded by the jury to
    $20,000. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relation to the first factor for which compensation may be awarded pursuant
    to s. 61 (expenses actually incurred for Andrea’s benefit) no claim was made
    for the expenses paid for professional nursing services provided to Andrea.
    The second factor is a reasonable allowance for travel expenses. The jury
    has already awarded the Appellants damages in the amount of $9,926.96 for
    out-of-pocket losses, which included itemized expenses for air travel and
    for their travel to and from various hospitals. As a result, it cannot be
    said that the jury did not consider the evidence regarding this factor in
    determining whether a claim for damages under s. 61 ought to be awarded.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Compensation
    may also be awarded for loss of income. The Respondents submit that it was
    open to the jury to reject Duncan McIntyre’s claim for loss of income. We
    agree. The evidence indicates that he did not pursue employment similar to
    that which he had at Sandford Fleming, which would not have affected his
    pension. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third factor is compensation for housekeeping and care provided to Andrea
    by her parents. Neither parent was challenged in cross-examination with respect
    to the nursing and housekeeping services they provided to Andrea. It is clear
    that Darlene provided nursing and housekeeping services to her and that Duncan
    left his job in Germany, in April, prior to the end of the school year to
    be with her in Ontario. While this factor cannot be ignored in assessing
    the reasonableness of the jury’s decision to dismiss the Appellants’ claim,
    the focus of their claim at trial and on appeal is for loss of Andrea’s care,
    guidance and companionship to her family. </p>

    v. MacKinnon </i>(1981), 32 O.R. (2d) 740 at 747 (H.C.). “Care” includes
    such things as feeding, clothing, cleaning, transportation, helping and protecting
    another person: <i>Thornborrow, supra. </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    each case, compensation for loss of guidance, care and companionship must
    be assessed in an objective and unemotional way: <i>Hamilton v. Canadian
    National Railway </i>(1991), 80 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 470 at para. 11 (Ont.

    The cardinal factors in fixing the precise amount are the extent and duration
    of the claimant’s loss: <i>Mortimer v. Cameron </i>(1992), 9 M.P.L.R. (2d)

    mother, father and sister all testified that following the accident Andrea
    was not the same person that she was prior to the accident. It was not contested
    at trial that her depression was causally linked to the accident and her
    resulting injuries. Andrea’s relationship with her parents was negatively
    affected by the depressive episodes in which she tried to take her own life.
    Darlene testified that they watched her like a hawk; Duncan testified that
    they felt guilty because they couldn’t seem to cure her; Alexis lost her
    role model. They all missed the fun times that they had together. The family
    felt they had to tread carefully with Andrea for fear of upsetting her. They
    were walking on eggshells around her.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    the time of trial (March 2004), the family dynamics were returning to normal.
    The evidence was that Andrea talks sports with Duncan and bets on football
    pools with him. Andrea has engaged in some sporting activities with her family.
    Alexis believes that her relationship with her sister has improved and that
    she could now seek Andrea’s advice and take it into consideration in making
    a decision. According to Alexis, the family seems to be having fun together
    again and is not afraid to say something or do something wrong. There was,
    however, evidence that there is a chance of Andrea going back into a depression. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Respondents submit that any loss in the quality of the family relations was
    transitory rather than permanent. However, the wording of s. 61 and existing
    jurisprudence indicate that it does not require that the loss be permanent
    in order for an award to be made (see e.g.: <i>Till v. Walker</i>, [2000]
    O.J. No. 84 (S.C.J.)). It is clear that the quality of the family relationship
    was affected in a way that was more than a fleeting or token loss. </p>

    also submits that the physical separation of Andrea from her parents during
    the years following the accident precludes an award for loss of her companionship
    being made. For the same reason, it submits that no award for loss of guidance
    to her younger sister can be made. We disagree. Certainly Andrea lived at
    home for extended periods following the accident. In addition, companionship
    is not limited to physical presence. Because companionship involves sharing
    interests and ideas with another person, communication of interests and ideas
    by email and telephone is a form of companionship. The evidence is undisputed
    that such communication was frequent with Andrea. The jury also heard unchallenged
    evidence as to the change in the dynamics of the family relationships and
    how it affected their companionship with Andrea. Thus, the only reasonable
    conclusion that the jury could have come to was that the quality of the family’s
    companionship with Andrea was significantly affected. In our opinion the
    jury’s verdict is so plainly unreasonable and unjust that we are satisfied
    that no jury, reviewing the evidence as a whole and acting judicially, could
    have refused to make any award.</p>

    that any of that evidence was improperly admitted and, as we have indicated,

  <p class=headingtitle><b>A. GENERAL PRINCIPLES RELATING TO PUNITIVE DAMAGES</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    principles underpinning an award of punitive damages in tort and in contract
    have been examined exhaustively by the Supreme Court of Canada in a number
    of cases over the past two decades: see <i>Vorvis v. Insurance Corporation
    of British Columbia</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1085; <i>Norberg v. Wynrib</i>,
    [1992] 2 S.C.R. 226; <i>Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto</i>, [1995]
    2 S.C.R. 1130; <i>Whiten v. Pilot Insurance Co.</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 595;
    and <i>Fidler v. Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada</i>, 2006 SCC 30. It is
    unnecessary to re-examine these authorities in detail.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Hill</i>,
    at paras. 196-197, Cory J. summarized the general principles as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Punitive damages may be awarded in situations where
    the defendant’s misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that
    it offends the court’s sense of decency. Punitive damages bear no relation
    to what the plaintiff should receive by way of compensation. Their aim is
    not to compensate the plaintiff, but rather to punish the defendant. It is
    the means by which the jury or judge expresses its outrage at the egregious
    conduct of the defendant. They are in the nature of a fine which is meant
    to act as a deterrent to the defendant and to others from acting in this
    manner. It is important to emphasize that punitive damages should only be
    awarded in those circumstances where the combined award of general and aggravated
    damages would be insufficient to achieve the goal of punishment and deterrence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Unlike compensatory damages, punitive damages are
    not at large. Consequently, courts have a much greater scope and discretion
    on appeal. The appellate review should be based upon <i>the court’s estimation
    as to whether the punitive damages serve a rational purpose</i>. In other
    words, was the misconduct of the defendant so outrageous that punitive damages
    were rationally required to act as deterrence? [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Whiten</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    Justice Binnie conducted a comprehensive review of the jurisprudence in the
    United States and in the Commonwealth countries. From that review he drew
    a number of principles which he concluded were consistent with Canadian practice
    and precedent. Those pertinent to this appeal are found at paras. 67-71 and
    101, and are reproduced below: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he attempt to limit punitive damages by “categories” does
    not work and was rightly rejected in Canada….The control mechanism lies not
    in restricting the category of case<i> but in rationally determining circumstances
    that warrant the addition of punishment to compensation in a civil action</i>….</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he general objectives of punitive damages are
    punishment (in the sense of retribution), deterrence of the wrongdoer and
    others, and denunciation…. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>[T]he primary vehicle of punishment is the criminal
      law (and regulatory offences) and … punitive damages should be resorted
      to only in exceptional cases and with restraint</i>. Where punishment has
      actually been imposed by a criminal court for an offence arising out of
      substantially the same facts, some jurisdictions, such as Australia and
      New Zealand, bar punitive damages in certain contexts … but the dominant
      approach in other jurisdictions, including Canada, is to treat it as another
      factor, albeit a factor of potentially great importance….</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he incantation of the time-honoured pejoratives
    (“high-handed, “oppressive”, “vindictive”, etc.) provides insufficient guidance
    (or discipline) to the judge or jury setting the amount. Lord Diplock in <i>Cassell,
    supra</i>, at p. 1129, called these the “whole gamut of dyslogistic judicial
    epithets”. A more principled and less exhortatory approach is desirable….</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>[A]ll jurisdictions seek to promote rationality</i>.
    In directing itself to the punitive damages, the court should relate the
    facts of the particular case to the underlying purposes of punitive damages
    and <i>ask itself how, in particular, an award would further one or other
    of the objectives of the law</i>, and what is the lowest award that would
    serve the purpose, i.e., because any higher award would be irrational.</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 align=center style='text-align:
center'><span lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The “rationality” test applies both to the question
    of whether an award of punitive damages should be made at all, as well as
    to the question of its quantum. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    consider the following two principles, extracted from the foregoing review,
    to be particularly significant for the purposes of this case:</p>
  <p class=MsoBlockText>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    existence of egregious conduct worthy of condemnation by the court – while
    the target of an award of punitive damages – is not, in itself, sufficient
    to justify the granting of such an exceptional remedy; and,</p>
  <p class=MsoBlockText>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court must have regard to all of the principles underpinning a punitive damages
    award in order to determine whether punitive damages serve a rational purpose
    in the circumstances. In particular, the court must be satisfied that the
    granting of punitive damages in a civil tort context
    – a concept foreign to the primarily compensatory rationale of tort law – advances
    the objectives of the remedy (punishment, deterrence, and denunciation),
    and outweighs the general rule that these public-oriented objectives are
    principally addressed by the criminal law.</p>
  <p class=headingtitle><b>B. ANALYSIS</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cases
    of this nature – which are, unfortunately, neither rare nor exceptional in
    our society – pose a dilemma in the punitive damages context. On the one
    hand, the conduct of an intoxicated driver, whose actions cause death or
    serious injury, readily fits the rhetoric of punitive damages. On the other
    hand, visiting that conduct with punitive damages does not readily fit with
    the rationality underpinning of the punitive damages remedy and has significant
    implications for the compensatory foundation of the law of torts. In addition,
    as I shall outline below, punitive damages, in the milieu of motor vehicle
    negligence, do not materially advance the objectives of punitive damages.
    Moreover, awarding punitive damages in what will inevitably become less than
    the rare and exceptional case tips the criminal law/private law balance respecting
    the imposition of a public sanction too far in the direction of a private
    law tort remedy. This will result in windfall recoveries for a large number
    of claimants whose compensatory entitlement has no relationship whatever
    to the recovery they will receive. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[122]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respectfully,
    unlike my colleagues, I would resolve this dilemma by concluding that punitive
    damages do not serve a rational purpose in the circumstances of this case,
    and, generally, in cases of this particular nature.</p>
  <p class=headingsubtitle><span lang=EN-US>(a)       Impaired Driving is Unacceptable
      but, Regrettably, not Rare</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    Andrew Grigg’s conduct is clearly deserving of condemnation. I agree with
    my colleagues that his decision to drive a motor vehicle after drinking excessively,
    and the manner of his driving (speeding and manoeuvring erratically) – both
    resulting in serious personal injury to an innocent pedestrian – support
    a finding that his conduct was deliberate and intentional, and that it showed
    a reckless disregard for the lives and safety of others on the road. However,
    these facts, while surely justifying criminal sanctions by the state, do
    not distinguish this case from many other similar factual situations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no question impaired driving is a phenomenon in our society that cannot
    be tolerated. Many authorities have expressed this sentiment, perhaps none
    more eloquently than Cory J. in <i>R v. Bernshaw</i> (1995), 95 C.C.C. (3d)
    193 at 204 (S.C.C.), cited above by the Chief Justice and Justice Weiler: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Every year drunk driving leaves a terrible trail
    of death, injury, heartbreak and destruction. From the point of view of numbers
    alone, it has a far greater impact on Canadian society than any other crime.
    In terms of the deaths and serious injuries resulting in hospitalization,
    drunk driving is clearly the crime which causes the most significant social
    loss to the country.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[125]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these very reasons, however, impaired driving cases readily lend themselves
    to the type of pejorative descriptors which courts frequently employ in awarding
    punitive damages: “wanton or reckless”, “contumelious”, “deserving of the
    court’s censure”, “offending the court’s sense of decency”, “malicious”,
    “high-handed and heinous”, “reckless disregard for the lives and safety of
    others”, etc. Nonetheless, as I have said, the fact that the impugned conduct
    may attract such descriptors is not sufficient, in itself, to support an
    award of punitive damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    conduct can be described with what Binnie J., in <i>Whiten</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at para. 70, called “the incantation of the time-honoured pejoratives” and
    with what Lord Diplock, in <i>Cassell &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Broome</i>, [1972]
    A.C. 1027 at 1129 (H.L.), referred to as “the whole gamut of dyslogistic
    judicial epithets”, it becomes all the more easy to lose sight of the important
    admonition that punitive damages are to be reserved for what is described
    in <i>Whiten</i>, at para. 105, as “[the] exceptional case that justifie[s]
    an exceptional remedy.” In <i>Whiten</i>, and more recently in <i>Fidler</i>,
    the Supreme Court of Canada has reinforced this cautionary golden thread
    that runs through all of the jurisprudence surrounding punitive damages – they
    are to be imposed in rare and exceptional cases, and even then only with
    restraint. The admonition should not be thrown to the four winds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[127]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    deplorable as the reality is, personal injuries arising from impaired driving
    cases are far from exceptional in our society. Thousands die or are injured
    each year. In Canada in 2003, for example, approximately 2,939 drivers were
    involved in alcohol-related motor vehicle accidents in which someone was
    seriously injured, and an estimated 902 people died in motor vehicle accidents
    in which at least one of the drivers had been drinking<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[8]</span></a>.
    By resisting the application of punitive damages to the circumstances of
    this case, I do not for one moment seek to minimize or to dishonour the injuries
    suffered by Ms. McIntyre, or to condone the conduct of Mr. Grigg. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[128]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    there is simply nothing on the record to distinguish this case from hundreds,
    if not thousands, of other similar situations. If punitive damages can be
    awarded on the facts of this case, they can be awarded in a great number
    of others where alcohol-induced motor vehicle accidents lead to death or
    injury –
    and, they will be. As I explain below, an award of punitive damages in this
    case, and others like it, will have significant implications for the law
    of torts, and for the relationship between the law of torts and the criminal
    law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[129]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    turn first, however, to a consideration of whether an award of punitive damages
    advances the underlying objectives of that remedy in the circumstances of
    this case.</p>
  <p class=headingsubtitle><span lang=EN-US>(b)       The Objectives of Punitive
      Damages are Not Advanced</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[130]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am not persuaded that an award of punitive damages in this case, and more
    generally, in the context of impaired driving and motor vehicle negligence,
    advances either the objectives of punishment or deterrence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[131]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Grigg is required by law in Ontario to be insured. Although the details of
    his insurance are not before the court, the Standard Automobile Owner’s Policy
    provides that where the insured is legally responsible for the bodily injury
    to, or death, of others, or for damage to the property of others, as a result
    of owning, using or operating the insured automobile, the insurer “will make
    any payment [on the insured’s behalf] <u>that the law requires</u>, up to
    the limits of the policy.”<a href="#_ftn9"
name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[9]</span></a> Nothing
    in the Standard Policy terms exclude punitive damages from this provision,
    and nothing negatives coverage vis-à-vis third parties as a result of intoxication.
    Thus, it is unlikely that Mr. Grigg – or other impaired drivers in similar
    situations – will have to pay the punitive damages awarded (subject to policy
    limits). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[132]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What,
    then, is accomplished in the way of punishment or deterrence by such an award?
    An award of punitive damages in these circumstances does little to advance
    the objectives of punitive damages, in my opinion, particularly when weighed
    against the injunction that such awards are to be reserved for exceptional
    cases that justify an exceptional remedy: <i>Whiten</i>, para. 105. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[133]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    if punitive damages are to be awarded in such circumstances, the social cost
    of such a development may be significant as well. Drivers in Ontario are
    insured. If insurers are to become exposed to an increasing risk of indemnifying
    for punitive damage awards, they will naturally be required to increase their
    reserves for losses accordingly. Even if coverage for punitive damages becomes
    optional, insurance premiums across the board will inevitably rise. In that
    sense, then, all automobile-owning members of society will effectively be
    “punished” for the conduct of Mr. Grigg and comparable drivers. Similar concerns
    underlie the “cap” on non-pecuniary damages imposed by the Supreme Court
    of Canada in the trilogy of cases referred to in the reasons of the Chief
    Justice and Justice Weiler: see, for example, <i>Arnold v. Teno</i> [1978]
    2 S.C.R. 287 at 333.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[134]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Erosion
    of the “rarity” principle drives other considerations that also militate
    against an award of punitive damages. Although he did acknowledge that such
    damages may be awarded in negligence in a proper case, Binnie J. noted, in <i>Whiten</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at para. 67, that punitive damages by their very nature “will largely be
    restricted to intentional torts”. I think there can be no doubt, however,
    that if punitive damages are found to be available in this case, they will
    be found to be available – and will be awarded – in many other personal injury
    or fatal accident cases arising out of alcohol-related motor vehicle accidents.
    In my opinion, such a development would distort the core rationale of tort
    law, namely, compensation, in fundamental ways.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[135]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the jurisprudence makes clear, punitive damages are not compensatory and
    have nothing to do with a plaintiff’s injuries; they are designed to punish,
    to deter, and to denounce a defendant’s egregious conduct. Thus, an award
    of punitive damages is a complete windfall for the plaintiff. While this
    may be of marginal concern where the award is made in the isolated rare and
    exceptional case, it becomes more disquieting if the award is made in a broader
    range of
    “less exceptional” circumstances. What is the rational purpose served by
    encouraging judges and juries – who may be emotionally “outraged” by the
    “impaired driving” aspect of a case – to make damage awards that are completely
    divorced from any injuries sustained by the plaintiff and thus unrelated
    to the compensatory raison d’être of tort law, on a more frequent basis?
    In my opinion, there is none.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[136]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is another troubling way in which an award of punitive damages in circumstances
    such as these warps the compensatory rationale that undergirds the tort system.
    I question the wisdom of a legal policy which has the effect of engrafting
    the criminal law functions of punishment, deterrence and denunciation upon
    a compensatory tort system in anything but the truly shocking and exceptional
    case – particularly in the negligence framework. As the Supreme Court of
    Canada has most recently noted, in <i>Fidler, supra,</i> at para. 62:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As stated in <i>Whiten</i>, at para. 36, “punitive
    damages straddle the frontier between civil law (compensation) and criminal
    law (punishment)”. <i>Criminal law and quasi-criminal regulatory schemes
    are recognized as the primary vehicles for punishment. It is important that
    punitive damages be resorted to only in exceptional cases, and with restraint</i>.<i> </i>[Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[137]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice
    LeBel touched on this problem in <i>Whiten</i>, <i>supra</i>, albeit in dissent.<a href="#_ftn10"
name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[10]</span></a> Stating
    that he agreed with Binnie J. on the core principles governing the award
    of punitive damages – the rationality and proportionality of the award remaining
    the key considerations – he noted, at para. 151, that,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[t]he concept of rationality remains grounded in
    the nature of tort law, its historical development and the functions it is
    now playing in modern society. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Later, at para. 158, he
    observed that,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[a]n overriding objective of general deterrence
    remains problematic, if punitive damages are to remain a useful incident
    of tort law. <i>Otherwise, their use may turn some parts of the law of tort
    into a sort of private criminal law, devoid of all the procedural and evidentiary
    constraints which have come to be associated with the criminal justice system</i>. [Emphasis

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[138]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    their reasons, the Chief Justice and Justice Weiler recognize the danger
    of judges and juries in civil cases second-guessing what has transpired in
    parallel criminal proceedings. Indeed, I agree with the following opinion
    expressed by them at para. 79:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where a wrongdoer has already been punished for
    an offence and the same conduct is in question at a civil trial, punitive
    damages will not generally serve a rational purpose as the sentence imposed
    in the criminal or regulatory environment will have already met the necessary
    objectives of retribution, deterrence and denunciation. In our view, there
    are sound policy reasons not to attempt to re-try those proceedings in a
    civil action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[139]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unlike
    my colleagues, however, I am not persuaded that the circumstances of this
    case constitute an exception to those sound policy reasons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[140]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    factual foundation for their conclusion lies in Mr. Grigg’s conviction for
    careless driving only, after a plea of guilty, and the $500.00 fine that
    was imposed on him. Other alcohol-related charges were withdrawn by the Crown,
    apparently because the police had omitted to advise Mr. Grigg of his right
    to counsel at the time of the accident, thereby, rendering inadmissible the
    breathalyser test results that would have demonstrated a high level of legal
    impairment on his part. The jury here, however, had the breathalyser results
    in evidence, as well as much expert and other testimony concerning Mr. Grigg’s
    impaired condition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[141]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    legal foundation for my colleagues’ conclusion rests on the
    “disproportionality” test, enunciated by Binnie J. in <i>Whiten, supra</i>,
    at para. 123, in relation to the wrongful conduct and the penalty imposed.
    For ease of reference, I reproduce the relevant portions of Binnie J.’s comments
    underlining the portion of his remarks on which my colleagues particularly
    rely:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Compensatory damages also punish. In many cases
    they will be all the “punishment” required. To the extent a defendant has
    suffered other retribution, denunciation or deterrence, either civil or criminal,
    for the misconduct in question, the need for <i>additional</i> punishment
    in the case before the court is lessened and may be eliminated. <u>In Canada,
    unlike some other common law jurisdictions, such “other” punishment is relevant
    but it is not necessarily a bar to the award of punitive damages.</u> <u>The
    prescribed fine, for example, may be disproportionately small to the level
    of outrage the jury wishes to express. The misconduct in question may be
    broader than the misconduct proven in evidence in the criminal or regulatory
    proceeding</u>. The legislative judgment fixing the amount of the potential
    fine may be based on policy considerations other than pure punishment. The
    key point is that punitive damages are awarded “if, but only if” <i>all</i> other
    penalties have been taken into account and found to be inadequate to accomplish
    the objectives of retributions, deterrence, and denunciation…. [Italics in
    original, underlining added.] </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[142]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the view of the Chief Justice and Justice Weiler that this
    “disproportionality” test – which is expressed in <i>obiter</i> in <i>Whiten</i> – should
    be approached with caution. Where I respectfully disagree is on the weight
    that should be attributed to the examples given by Binnie J. in the underlined
    portion of the above passage. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[143]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    read those comments as providing general examples of the legal principle
    being enunciated, not as binding legal principles themselves. The legal principle
    is that in Canada, unlike in some other common law jurisdictions, “other”
    punishment in parallel criminal proceedings is relevant but is not necessarily
    a bar to the award of punitive damages. I do not understand Justice Binnie
    as intending to elevate to the level of binding legal principle the notion
    that it should be open to judges and juries, in the many alcohol-related
    negligence cases that come before them, to second-guess the punishment imposed
    in parallel criminal proceedings on the basis (a) that the fine imposed was
    not consistent with their “level of outrage” or (b) that they may feel the
    civil case encompassed more wrongful conduct than what was addressed in the
    criminal proceeding. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[144]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Outrage”
    is not a sound yardstick for measuring legal policy (although it may form
      a basis for applying it). In this case, for example, the jury’s level of
      outrage led them to make a punitive damage award of $100,000. It is hard
      to conceive of an impaired driving offence where a fine of that dimension,
      or even a fine of $20,000 (the amount of punitive damages upheld by the
      majority here), would be imposed. Would it follow that judges or juries
      in civil cases such as this are entitled to superimpose their version of
      a “fine” on the defendant even though the defendant was required to pay
      a fine perfectly in keeping with the principles of sentencing in criminal
      law, and to do so just because the fine imposed does not accord with their “level
      of outrage”? Or, because they felt that the misconduct in question before
      them was broader than the misconduct proved in the criminal proceeding? </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[145]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    judge or jury in the civil proceeding cannot know the answer to this latter
    question – or, indeed, to the question of whether the fine imposed in the
    criminal proceeding was appropriate for that proceeding – without knowing
    all of the evidence and all of the factors underlying the disposition of
    the criminal proceeding. They cannot know these dynamics of the parallel
    criminal case without having tried it. There is a well-founded policy against
    the duplication of legal proceedings. I do not see how the preservation of
    public order and the tempering of harm done to the public good – the objectives
    of punitive damages – are advanced by allowing judges or juries in civil
    cases to override what they may perceive to be imperfections in the criminal
    proceedings, except in the truly rarest of cases.</p>
  <p class=headingtitle><b>C.        Conclusion</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[146]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    recognize the wisdom of Binnie J.’s counsel in <i>Whiten</i>, that punitive
    damages are not to be limited by “categories” – either <i>to</i> certain
    classes of cases, or by exclusion <i>from</i> certain classes of cases. However,
    there may be types of cases where, as a general rule, punitive damage awards
    are inappropriate for policy or other reasons. Accordingly, while I would
    not say that there can never be an award of punitive damages in impaired
    driving cases involving death or serious personal injury, I would put such
    cases in this latter category. Having regard to the factors outlined above,
    and the rationality principle that underlies an award of punitive damages,
    the circumstances of this case do not – again, borrowing the words of Binnie
    J. in <i>Whiten</i>, at para. 67 – “warrant the addition of punishment to
    compensation in a civil action.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[147]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would allow the appeal with respect to punitive damages and set aside the
    award in that regard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[148]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    I am wrong in this conclusion, I agree with the Chief Justice and Justice
    Weiler that the quantum of the punitive damages award should be reduced from
    $100,000 to $20,000. With respect to the other issues on the appeal, I agree
    with them and with the disposition of those issues in the manner set out
    in the reasons of the court.</p>

'>But see <i>Nelson v. Welsh</i> (1985), 70 N.S.R. (2d) 422 (S.C. (T.D.)), where
      Richard J. rejected a claim for punitive damages in an impaired driving
      case. Richard J. found that when the only factor that is beyond negligence
      is the driver’s intoxication or impairment, punitive damages should not
      be awarded. In coming to this conclusion the trial judge relied on decisions
      refusing punitive damages in cases involving the negligence of a surgeon
      and the defective manufacture of a product. As noted elsewhere in our decision
      in this case, the law has evolved such that punitive damages have now been
      awarded in these types of cases. The trial judge was also of the opinion
      that the driver’s<u> </u>insurance company pays the damage award and punitive
      damages would have no deterrent value. Our understanding is that the terms
      of the policy will dictate whether or not punitive damages would be included.
      Furthermore, while doctors are covered by insurance, punitive damages have
      nevertheless been awarded against them when they have breached the doctor-patient
      relationship. See <i>Norberg v. Weinnrib</i>, <i>supra </i>and <i>Gerula
      v. Flores</i>, <i>infra</i>. The analysis in <i>Nelson </i>is therefore
