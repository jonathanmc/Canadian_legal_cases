    appellant father appeals from the judgment of Greer J. awarding the respondent
    mother sole custody of the child of the marriage and permitting the mother
    to move with the child out of Ontario.  He also seeks leave to appeal the
    costs order.  For the following reasons the appeal is allowed in part and
    paragraph 2 of the Judgment is struck out.  In all other respects the appeal
    is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    the time of the appeal (over two years since the trial) the mother and child
    had returned to Toronto.  Thus, the mobility issue was no longer a concern.  Rather,
    the principal concern on this appeal is the trial judge’s order awarding
    the mother sole custody.  The father submits that the mother has so consistently
    interfered with access to the child that the only way to vindicate the principle
    of maximum contact in s. 16(10) of the <i>Divorce Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c.
    3 (2<sup>nd</sup> Supp.) as amended is to give him sole custody.  He submits
    that the trial judge failed to give adequate consideration to the maximum
    contact principle and made an unreasonable finding that the mother would
    facilitate access.  He also submits that the trial judge unreasonably failed
    to give effect to the findings of the custody assessor, Linda Chodos.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s decisions on both these issues primarily turned on her findings
    of fact and counsel recognized that those findings are entitled to deference
    and will only be set aside on the basis of a palpable and overriding error.  In
    balancing the various factors in a child custody matter the decision of the
    trial judge is entitled to considerable deference.  In <i>Van de Perre v.
    Edwards</i> (2001), 204 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 257 (S.C.C.) at para. 11
    Bastarache J. referred to the reasons of the court in <i>Hickey v. Hickey, </i>[1999]
    2 S.C.R. 518 at paras. 10 and 12:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[Trial judges]
    must balance the objectives and factors set out in the <i>Divorce Act</i> or
    in provincial support statutes with an appreciation of the particular facts
    of the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a difficult but important determination, which
    is critical to the lives of the parties and to their children.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because
    of its fact-based and discretionary nature, trial judges must be given considerable
    deference by appellate courts when such decisions are reviewed.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>                                                …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>There are strong
    reasons for the significant deference that must be given to trial judges
    in relation to support orders.&nbsp;&nbsp;This standard of appellate review
    recognizes that the discretion involved in making a support order is best
    exercised by the judge who has heard the parties directly.&nbsp;&nbsp;It
    avoids giving parties an incentive to appeal judgments and incur added expenses
    in the hope that the appeal court will have a different appreciation of the
    relevant factors and evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach promotes finality
    in family law litigation and recognizes the importance of the appreciation
    of the facts by the trial judge.&nbsp;&nbsp;Though an appeal court must intervene
    when there is a material error, a serious misapprehension of the evidence,
    or an error in law, it is not entitled to overturn a support order simply
    because it would have made a different decision or balanced the factors differently.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Bastarache
    J. then observed at para. 12 that while <i>Hickey </i>was a support case,
    the same considerations apply to a child custody case.  As he said, “The
    narrow power of appellate review does not allow an appellate court to delve
    into all custody cases in the name of the best interests of the child where
    there is no material error as decided in Hickey.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court of
    Appeal is not in a position to determine what it considers to be the correct
    conclusions from the evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the role of the trial judge.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her thorough and helpful submissions, Ms. David has shown several mistakes
    by the trial judge in her review of some of the facts.  Those errors, however,
    do not demonstrate that the trial judge made any overriding error.  In particular,
    with respect to the question of the application of s. 16(10), the trial judge
    is required to give effect to the principle that a child should have as much
    contact with each spouse “as is consistent with the best interests of the
    child”.  The judge must for that purpose take into consideration the willingness
    of the person for whom custody is sought to facilitate contact.  The trial
    judge was alive to all of these issues.  She found that the mother would
    facilitate access with the father.  The father challenges that finding.  But,
    the trial judge accepted the evidence of the mother and her witnesses and
    that evidence provided a reasonable basis for that finding.  There is no
    question that the father’s access became more limited after the July 2001
    long weekend incident, but the mother’s concerns were reasonable given the
    father’s living arrangements at the time.  We cannot say that the trial judge’s
    finding concerning the mother’s commitment to access for the father was unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was also a body of evidence to support the trial judge’s conclusion that
    granting the father sole custody would not have been in the child’s best
    interests.  The trial judge referred to a number of matters in addition to
    the July incident that suggested in her view that the father showed poor
    judgment and that some of his decisions were not in the child’s best interests.  The
    father submits that many of the matters were minor and should not have been
    factors in the decision.  However, the weight to attach to the various circumstances
    is a matter for the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that in the alternative the trial judge erred in failing
    to award joint custody.  That was not feasible given the relationship between
    the parties and given the trial judge’s decision on mobility. The decision
    on mobility was amply supported by the evidence.  The trial judge found that
    the move to Montreal would be in the best interests of the child despite
    the fact that it would mean a different and probably more limited access
    regime.  The evidence from the wife, her then companion, and the members
    of his family supported the trial judge’s decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the weight to be attached to the custody assessor’s evidence,
    in our view, there was no error by the trial judge.  The weight to be attached
    to the evidence of any expert is a matter for the trier of fact.  The trial
    judge did not simply dismiss the evidence out of hand.  She gave detailed
    reasons for why she did not agree with the assessor’s conclusion and why
    she found it lacking in many respects.  While the appellant submits that
    the trial judge misapprehended some of the evidence and gave unfair weight
    to some issues, we are satisfied that the conclusion was supported by the
    record.  To take one example, the trial judge took an entirely different
    view of the impact of the July 2001 incident than did the assessor.  The
    assessor did not consider it significant; the trial judge did.  Whether or
    not we would have placed as much emphasis on the incident as did the trial
    judge is beside the point.  The weight to be attached to the impact of the
    incident was for the trial judge.  The trial judge could not simply delegate
    her fact-finding responsibilities to the assessor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his written submissions, the appellant raises a number of other issues.  Most
    of those issues concern the weight to be attached to certain factors.  We
    are not persuaded that any of those grounds amount to reversible error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    father filed extensive fresh evidence on the appeal.  Given the over two-year
    period since the decision of the trial judge we have considered this fresh
    evidence.  The evidence shows that the mother’s relationship with her companion
    in Quebec ended and she returned to Ontario about a year later.  The father
    had limited opportunity for access while the mother and child were in Quebec.  We
    accept that the mother’s conduct may not have always facilitated access,
    but there were other reasons, including the father’s own financial situation,
    that impacted on the access while the mother and child lived in Quebec.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    their return to Ontario, the access has fallen into a regular pattern where
    the child and the father make their own access arrangements, usually one
    day every other weekend.  We agree with the father that this could not be
    considered the kind of generous access as was contemplated by the trial judge’s
    order.  However, the child of the marriage is now thirteen years of age and
    this is the access that she appears to desire.  The fresh evidence does not
    convince us that the mother is attempting to undermine the relationship with
    the father.  That said, we remind the mother that access is not solely her
    daughter’s responsibility.  The trial judge’s order was directed to the parties,
    not the child and she has an obligation to facilitate the father’s access.  Further,
    it is still open to the father to apply to the trial judge pursuant to paragraph
    4 of the Judgment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    father also seeks leave to appeal the costs order.  Unquestionably, the trial
    judge misapprehended the father’s first offer to settle.  But, the fact remains
    that the mother achieved substantial success on the issues that dominated
    the trial.  Awarding costs to the mother is consistent with the principle
    set out in Rule 24 of the <i>Family Law Rules</i>, O. Reg. 114/99.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    aside from setting aside paragraph 2 of the Judgment, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    have given anxious consideration to the question of costs.  The father achieved
    some success in that the mobility clause has been removed.  He is also rightly
    concerned that the mother has not done everything she could to facilitate
    access as contemplated by the Judgment.  In the circumstances, there will
    be no order for costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the hearing of the appeal, the mother raised a problem she is having in settling
    the costs order made by the trial judge.  From the record, we gather that
    there is a dispute about the disbursements.  We remind the parties of Goodman
    J.’s order clarifying the trial judge’s order in respect of costs and in
    particular her order that, “Delay in the determination of the disbursements
    shall not delay the payment of sums already fixed and referred to in this
    paragraph.”  We are not in a position to fix the disbursements.  If the parties
    cannot agree on the amount of the disbursements they should take out an appointment
    with the trial judge as provided for in Goodman J.’s order.</p>
