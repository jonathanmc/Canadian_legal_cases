  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the decision
      of Justice Peter A. Cumming of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting as
      a summary conviction appeal judge, dated March 11, 2004, dismissing the
      appeal against conviction by Justice Monte H. Harris of the Ontario Court
    of Justice dated October 2, 2002.</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ROSENBERG J.A.:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal principally concerns the power of arrest under the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H. 8 (the “Act”).  The appellant was charged with assaulting a
    peace officer in the execution of his duty and assault with intent to resist
    arrest.  Both charges turned on the
    legality of the arrest.  If an arrest is
    unlawful, the officer is not in the execution of his or her duty and the
    citizen is entitled to resist the arrest.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the police officer purported to arrest the
    appellant because he failed to identify himself as required by the Act.  The Act, however,
    carefully circumscribes the arrest power.  In particular, the power of arrest does not arise because a motorist
    refuses to produce his or her licence.  Rather, where the person refuses to produce the licence, the officer is
    entitled to arrest without warrant under s. 217 of the Act only where the person has also refused to give reasonable
    identification “when requested by a police officer”:  <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>, s.
    33(3).  In my view, the circumstances
    authorizing an arrest did not arise in this case and the arrest was not
    legal.  It follows that this appeal
    should be allowed and the charges against the appellant dismissed.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
    FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant is a taxicab driver.  A uniformed police officer, Constable Allcroft, stopped the
    appellant on a busy downtown Toronto street around noon on April 30, 2002
    because the appellant did not appear to be wearing a seat belt.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a>  According to the officer, the appellant left
    his car and approached him.  The exact
    sequence of events is important and so I set out his testimony verbatim.  Constable Allcroft gave the same version in
    direct and cross-examination and the trial judge accepted his version of
    events:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Q.            What did you say to
    Mr.&nbsp;Plummer?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>A.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At this time, I requested that he provide me with his driver’s
    licence, ownership and insurance for the vehicle.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>Q.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And what did he say or do in response to that?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>A.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He stated to me, “Why, what’d you stop me for?”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>Q.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did you make a reply?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>A.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, I did. I advised him that he was not wearing his seatbelt
    and I asked again to see his driver’s licence, ownership and insurance.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>Q.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And what did he say, if anything?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>A.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The male stated, “What’s your fucking problem, why are [you]
    pulling me over?”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>Q.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What did you say then?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>A.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I then said, “Sir, if you don’t provide your driver’s licence,
    ownership and insurance, I may have to arrest you for failing to identify.”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Q. Did Mr. Plummer
    produce any documents at that time?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A.            Well at this time he stated, “Fuck
    you.” He continued swearing at me as he walked back to the driver’s door of his
    vehicle.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Q.            What happened then?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A.            He leaned into the vehicle and he
    came back out holding a tape recorder. At this time he pushed a button on the
    recorder and stated, “Now what are you going to do? Fuck You.”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Q.            What did you do?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A.            At this time I advised him that he
    was under arrest for failing to identify.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Q.            And officer, just so we’re clear,
    what was the basis for arresting Mr. Plummer at that point?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A.            Under the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> it’s an offence, an arrestable offence, to fail to identify to a police officer
    who’s investigating an offence under the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, a scuffle ensued as the appellant attempted to
    resist the arrest.  The officer was
    eventually able to subdue the appellant with the assistance of another citizen.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
    TRIAL JUDGE’S REASONS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before the trial judge, M. Harris J., the only issue was
    credibility.  The appellant’s version of
    events was different from that of the officer. He denied that he refused to
    produce his licence. His counsel, not Mr. Harris, did not argue that even on
    the officer’s version of events the arrest was unlawful.  The trial judge rejected the appellant’s
    evidence and accepted the evidence of the officer and the citizens who came to
    the officer’s assistance.  He convicted
    the appellant of the charge of resisting arrest and stayed the other charge in
    accordance with the doctrine in <i>R. v.
    Kienapple</i>, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
    REASONS OF THE SUMMARY CONVICTION APPEAL COURT JUDGE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal to the summary conviction appeal court, the
    appellant argued that the trial judge had not properly dealt with issues of
    credibility.  The appeal judge,
    Cumming&nbsp;J., dismissed that ground of appeal.  The appellant also argued that, accepting the officer’s evidence,
    the arrest was not valid because the circumstances described in s.&nbsp;33(3)
    of the Act did not arise.  In the appeal court, Crown counsel argued
    that the appellant should not be allowed to raise this issue for the first time
    on appeal.  The appeal judge resolved
    that issue against the Crown on the basis that the onus was on the Crown to
    prove all essential elements of the offence.  The legality of the arrest was an essential element of both
    charges.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the appeal judge held that the arrest was valid.  He agreed that “a single demand for
    identification, without more” cannot trigger the arrest power through the
    combined operation of ss. 33(3) and 217(2) of the Act.  But, a “demand for
    the licence followed by a second demand and supplemented by a warning that the
    person will be arrested if s/he fails to identify herself/himself will be
    sufficient to trigger the arrest power”.  He held that it was “clear that the Appellant, by his words and his
    conduct, would not identify himself”, despite a positive duty imposed by s. 33
    to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal court judge went on to state that even if the
    arrest were unlawful, the appellant should not have resorted to a self-help
    remedy of resisting the arrest.  Rather
    the appellant should have complied and sought his remedy in the criminal or
    civil courts or through the police complaints bureau.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
    APPEAL TO THIS COURT</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant now appeals to this court and makes the same two
    arguments that he made to the summary conviction appeal court.  Since I have concluded that the arrest was
    not valid, I need not determine the other ground of appeal concerning the
    manner in which the trial judge resolved the credibility issues.  In this court, Crown counsel does not
    challenge the right of the appellant to pursue the ground of appeal concerning
    the lawfulness of the arrest.</p>

line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Resolution of this case depends first on the proper
    interpretation of the applicable provisions of the Act.  I will then apply
    the facts of this case to that interpretation.  It was not contended that any other statutory or common law arrest power

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As is well known, the Supreme Court of Canada has adopted the
    purposive or modern approach to statutory interpretation as described in
    Driedger's <i>Construction of Statutes</i>, 2d ed. (Toronto: Butterworths,
    1983) at 87:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Today there is
    only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in
    their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously
    with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of
    Parliament.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This principle of statutory interpretation applies in civil
    and criminal cases.  See <i>R. v. Sharpe</i>,
    [2001] 1 S.C.R. 45 at para. 33 and <i>R. v.
    Russell</i>, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 804 at para. 32.  However, if, after applying the purposive approach, genuine ambiguities
    remain, the court will adopt that interpretation favouring the liberty of the
    subject.  See <i>R. v. McIntosh</i>, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 686 at para. 29.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The process of statutory interpretation favoured by the
    Supreme Court of Canada requires a court to consider the grammatical and
    ordinary meaning of the provisions in question, the legislative history and the
    intention of Parliament or the Legislature, the scheme of the Act, and the legislative
    context.  See <i>R. v. Ulybel Enterprises Ltd., </i>[2001] 2 S.C.R. 867 at paras. 28 –

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The point of contention in this case turns on the subordinate
    or dependent clause “when requested by a police officer or officer appointed
    for carrying out the provisions of this Act”.  The proposition set out in the main clause in s. 33(3) is the
    requirement that a person give reasonable identification.  The dependent clause instructs that this obligation
    arises when requested by a police officer or <span lang=EN>officer appointed for carrying out the provisions of the Act.  There are three possible readings of s. 33(3).  One, the obligation arises when an officer demands that a driver
    produce his or her licence on the theory that such a demand implies an
    obligation to provide identification.  Two, the obligation to provide alternative identification arises only
    when an officer makes a separate and specific demand for alternative
    identification.  Three, the obligation
    to provide alternative identification arises where an officer repeats the
    demand for a driver’s licence. The third interpretation is the one that seems
    to have been adopted by the appeal judge.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN>Several elements of
    s. 33 suggest that the second meaning is the ordinary or grammatical
    reading.  First, the drafter has used
    two different terms: “demand” in s.&nbsp;33(1) in reference to production of
    the licence and “request” in s. 33(3) in reference to alternative identification.  This suggests that an officer must do
    something other than simply make or repeat the s. 33(1) demand for surrender of
    a licence for inspection to trigger a possible contravention of s. 33(3). I
    appreciate that a motorist will perceive little practical difference between a
    demand from a police officer as opposed to a request. He or she will feel the
    same compulsion to comply. My point here is that the drafter intended to
    distinguish between the s. 33(1) action and the s. 33(3) action because two
    different words are used.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN>Second, an interpretation
    of the provision that does not require a separate request for alternative
    identification would offend the rule of interpretation that <span class=loose1><span

    meaningless words or phrases.  See</span></span> </span><span class=verdana1><i><span

    [2005] 2 S.C.R. 539.  If the officer
    simply had to make the s. 33(1) demand to trigger the obligation for
    alternative identification, the dependent clause would be redundant.  The drafter could simply have worded s.
    33(3) as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>Every person who is unable or refuses to surrender
    his or her licence in accordance with subsection (1) or (2) shall give
    reasonable identification of himself or herself and, for the purposes of this
    subsection, the correct name and address of the person shall be deemed to be
    reasonable identification.</span></p>

line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN>Third, a
    requirement of alternative identification is not implicit in the demand to
    produce a licence.  An officer may have
    reasons for requiring a person to produce his or her licence that are
    unconnected with its identification function.  For example, an officer may be familiar with a driver and may be using
    the demand for the purpose of determining whether the person’s licence is
    current.  Alternatively, an officer,
    although familiar with a driver’s identity, may use the demand as a means of
    checking on the sobriety of a driver, as permitted by s. 48 of the Act.  If the driver fumbles for the licence or seems disoriented by the question,
    the officer may acquire a reasonable suspicion sufficient to trigger an
    approved screening device demand under s. 254(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</span>  </p>

line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The one element of s. 33(3) tending to support an
    interpretation that an officer is not required to make a second specific
    request for alternative identification is the presence of the commas before and
    after the subordinate clause.  The use
    of the commas identifies this clause as a non-restrictive relative clause, that
    is, the clause could be omitted without essential loss of meaning.  That said, I would not attach much weight to
    the comma usage because, as the legislative history shows, even when the clause
    clearly was a restrictive relative clause, the drafter separated the clause
    from the rest of the sentence by commas.  I will now turn to that legislative history.</p>

    the Act at issue in this case came into force on June&nbsp;6, 1994.  The predecessor to s. 33 was s. 14 of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>, R.S.O. 1960, c.
    172, which provided as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>14.(1)  Every operator of a motor vehicle shall

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are two significant aspects of the 1960
    legislation.  First, a constable or
    officer appointed for carrying out the provisions of the Act could only demand production of a
    motorist’s licence.  There was no power
    to demand some other type of identification.  Second, the penalty for failing to produce a licence was the monetary
    fine or licence suspension set out in s. 14(2).  The warrantless arrest power in [then] ss.&nbsp;156&nbsp;(2), (3)
    of the 1960 Act did not permit
    arrest for failing to comply with s. 14(1): </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>156. (2)  Every constable or officer appointed for

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1969, the government introduced amendments to the Act.  It appears that these amendments were motivated, in part, by the
    recommendations of Chief Justice McRuer in the <i>Royal Commission Inquiry into
    Civil Rights: Report Number One</i>, vol. 2 (Toronto: Queen’s Printer,
    1968).  Among other things, he called
    attention to the random and broad arrest powers in the Act and to the fact that those arrest powers could be exercised,
    not only by constables, but by officers appointed by the Minister for carrying
    out the provisions of the Act.<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[3]</span></a>  See pp. 728-31 of Report Number One, vol. 2.
    McRuer C.J.H.C. was of the view that arrest without warrant should be
    restricted to cases where the driver “without showing reasonable cause, does
    not properly identify himself and the owner of the vehicle, and those cases in
    which the driver does not appear to have any legal right to have the vehicle on
    the highway” (p. 731). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The relevant amendments were as follows. First, Bill 105 would
    have repealed s.&nbsp;14(2) and substituted the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(2) Every person
    who is unable or refuses to produce his licence in accordance with subsection 1
    shall, when requested by a constable, identify himself by some other means
    satisfactory to the constable.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>Second,
    the arrest powers in the Act were to be amended to permit, for the first time, the power to arrest for
    failing to identify. Third, like the present legislation, the arrest power in
    [then] s. 156 distinguished between constables and everyone else, including <span
lang=EN>officers appointed for carrying out the
    provisions of the Act</span>. A constable could arrest without
    warrant on the basis of reasonable and probable grounds.  Anyone else could arrest only where he or
    she found a person actually committing the offence.  Fourth, the government proposed to remove the arrest power for
    certain offences, such as failing to provide a notice of change of
    ownership.  Finally, the specific
    penalty provision in s. 14 was replaced with a general penalty provision in s.
    154 of a fine of not less than $20 and not more than $100.  Section 14(1) was unaffected by the proposed
    amendments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was opposition to the new s. 14(2) because it appeared
    to give constables discretion to decide what form of identification would be
    satisfactory.  This kind of unfettered
    discretion was said to be inconsistent with the McRuer Report.  Accordingly, the Minister of Transport
    proposed the following version:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(2)            Every person who is unable or
    refuses to produce his licence in accordance with subsection 1 shall, when
    requested by a constable, give reasonable identification of himself and, for
    the purposes of this subsection, the correct name and address of such person
    shall be deemed to be a reasonable identification.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several points emerge at this point in the Act’s history.  While a constable or “<span lang=EN>officer appointed for carrying out the provisions
    of this Act” could make a demand to a motorist to produce the licence under s.
    14(1), the reasonable identification provision was limited to a request from a
    constable.  Thus, the warrantless arrest
    power in [then] s. 156 could only be triggered by the actions of a
    constable.  Finally, the new version of
    s. 14(2) eliminated a constable’s discretion to decide what constituted
    reasonable identification by deeming the correct name and address to be
    reasonable identification.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It seems to me that, at this point, the legislation was ambiguous
    as to whether there had to be a second demand before the arrest power was
    triggered.  It is possible that the
    clause “when requested by a constable” was not inserted to create a second
    demand requirement, but to clarify that s. 14(2) was triggered only when the
    initial demand for production of a licence was made by a constable and not
    simply by an <span lang=EN>officer appointed for
    carrying out the provisions of the Act.  Alternatively, s. 14(2) is capable of requiring that, in addition to the
    s. 33(1) “demand” for the licence, there must be a “request” for
    identification.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN>I point out that
    the clause “when requested by a constable” is a restrictive relative clause in
    that the clause is essential to the meaning of the sentence.  The clause, at least, was intended to
    restrict the operation of the alternative identification requirement to demands
    or requests by constables and probably should not have been separated from the
    rest of the sentence by commas.  In the
    result, it may be that the use of commas in the various versions of the
    provision does not materially assist in interpreting s. 33(3).</span></p>

    significant amendment to the relevant provisions occurred in the 1990 Revised
    Statutes of Ontario.  Section 14 has now
    become s. 33 and the legislation has been amended to be gender neutral.  It is also important at this point to note
    the French language version.  Section 33
    in the French and English versions of R.S.O. 1990 reads as follows:</span></p>

    officer and not simply by an <span lang=EN>officer

    licence must provide some other form of identification.  If the person fails to comply, the
    warrantless arrest power in [now] s.&nbsp;217 is triggered.  Reference to the French version of the
    legislation could resolve the apparent ambiguity in the English version in
    accordance with the shared meaning rule explained by the Supreme Court of
    Canada in <i>R. v. Hinchey</i>, [1996] 3
    S.C.R. 1128.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"

    versions of the legislation were slightly different.  Speaking for the majority at para. 50, L’Heureux-Dubé J. held as
    follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>Since the two versions are somewhat

    Côté <i>The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada</i> (2nd ed. 1991), at p.
    275. It does not appear that the sections are contradictory; rather, the
    English version is open to different interpretations while the French version
    is open to just one. Given the purpose of the statute, which is to preserve the
    appearance of integrity, I believe the French version is the applicable one. I
    find it hard to see how the purpose of the statute would be furthered by
    accepting the broader English meaning. <i>As

    amendments to the Act with the <i>Highway Traffic Amendment Act (Novice
    Drivers), 1993</i> S.O. 1993, c. 40.  This legislation introduced graduated
    licensing  into Ontario.  Among other things, the new legislation
    renumbered s. 33(2) as s. 33(3) and enacted a new s. 33(2) requiring an
    “accompanying driver” to carry his or her licence and to surrender the licence

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The French version of s. 33(3) now more closely tracks the
    English version. As a result of the rearrangement of the words in the French

line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I draw the following conclusions from this legislative
    history.  When the Act was amended in
    1969, at least one purpose of the Legislature was to bring the Act into
    conformity with the recommendations of the McRuer Report.  This was achieved by limiting the scope of
    the warrantless arrest power to a failure to identify, not merely a failure to
    produce a licence, and removing the officer’s discretion to determine what
    constituted suitable identification.  The Legislature must have intended that a person could not be arrested
    without warrant for failing or refusing to produce a licence and that something
    more or different was required.  Interpreting the Act to require a separate request for identification
    alternative to the licence to trigger the arrest power is most consonant with
    that intention and the use in the English version of the two different terms
    “demand” and “request”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, the alternative identification requirement was
    ambiguous and could also be interpreted as requiring the person to provide
    identification pursuant to a single demand where that demand was made by a
    police officer.  The pre-1993 French
    version of the legislation tends to favour this interpretation.  The post-1993 French version is of little
    assistance as it is now open to the same reading as the English version.  I point out, however, that if the provision
    is ambiguous, it ought to be interpreted in a manner that favours the liberty
    of the subject.  That brings me to a
    discussion of the scheme of the Act.</p>

    many purposes.  It is first and foremost
    a collection of duties and obligations imposed on drivers in relation to
    operation of vehicles, especially motor vehicles, to ensure the safety of
    motorists and others.  See <i>Harris v. Yellow Cab Ltd.</i>, [1926] 3
    D.L.R. 254 (Ont. C.A.).  It also
    establishes a licensing scheme and gives to police officers (and other officers
    appointed for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the Act) powers to
    enforce this bundle of regulations, including the licensing scheme.  However, the Act is only quasi-criminal
    legislation and strict limits have been placed on the powers of police and
    others to enforce the legislated duties and obligations by means more normally
    associated with criminal legislation.  The limited power of arrest is one example.  Under the <i>Criminal Code</i>, a person can be arrested without
    warrant for any offence.  Under the Act, the circumstances that can
    trigger an arrest have been closely circumscribed.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[5]</span></a>  While there are some other arrest powers in
    the Act, the general arrest
    power is found in s. 217.  The relevant
    parts of s. 217 are the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>217. <a
name="217.(2)"><span lang=EN>(2)</span></a><span
lang=EN>&nbsp;&nbsp;Any police officer who, on
    reasonable and probable grounds, believes that a contravention of any of the
    provisions of subsection 9&nbsp;(1), subsection 12&nbsp;(1), subsection
    13&nbsp;(1), subsection 33&nbsp;(3), subsection 47&nbsp;(5), (6), (7) or (8),
    section 51, 53, 130, 172 or 184, subsection 185&nbsp;(3), clause
    200&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;(a) or subsection 216&nbsp;(1) has been committed, may
    arrest, without warrant, the person he or she believes committed the
    contravention.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><a name="217.(3)"><span
lang=EN>(3)</span></a><span lang=EN>&nbsp;&nbsp;Every person may arrest without
    warrant any person whom he or she finds committing any such
    contravention.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the most important point in considering the
    legislative scheme is the relationship between s. 33 and the warrantless arrest
    power in s. 217.  As pointed out above,
    s. 33(1) imposes duties on drivers to carry their licence and produce it upon
    demand.  However, a driver cannot be
    arrested without warrant for breach of these duties.  The power to arrest without warrant is set out in s. 217(2) and
    applies only to contravention of s. 33(3).  Section 217(2) gives a police officer the power to arrest for the s.
    33(3) contravention on the basis of reasonable and probable grounds.  Section 217(3) gives anyone, which would
    include an officer appointed for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of
    the Act, the power to arrest
    for the contraventions mentioned in s.&nbsp;217(2).  However, the person exercising the power to arrest under s.
    217(3) must actually find a person committing the contravention.  He or she cannot make an arrest on the basis
    of reasonable and probable grounds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Interpreting s. 33(3) so that an officer is not required to
    specifically request alternative identification would undermine the
    Legislature’s intention that failure to produce a licence is not a
    contravention for which a driver can be arrested without warrant.  It would undermine the obvious intention to
    limit the warrantless arrest power.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Legislative
    Context</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The final factor to consider is the legislative context
    in which s. 33(3) is found.  Section 33
    is found in Part IV of the Act.  Section 31 provides that the purpose of Part
    IV is to protect the public by ensuring that “<span lang=EN>the privilege of driving on a highway is granted to, and retained by, only
    those persons who demonstrate that they are likely to drive safely” and that full
    driving privileges are granted only after new drivers have gained the necessary
    experience.  Section 33 assists with
    these purposes by providing a means of ensuring that only properly licensed
    persons are on the road and as a first step in identifying persons who may be
    abusing the driving privilege.  An
    interpretation that is most consistent with this context is one that gives a
    police officer two distinct powers: a power to demand a licence and a power to
    require alternative identification.</span></p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Other
    cases</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>There has
    been some consideration of s. 33(3).  <i>R. v. Waechter</i>, [2006] O.J. No. 1466
    (Ct. J.), <i>R. v. Malik</i>, [2001] O.J.
    No. 4547 (Ct. J.), <i>R. v. Blake</i>,

name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[6]</span></a> support the view that there must be a request to provide identification before
    s.&nbsp;33(3) is triggered.  The only
    case that appears to support the view taken by the appeal judge in this case is <i>R. v. Bugaeva</i>, [1999] O.J. No. 2738
    (Ct. J.), although there is little analysis of the provision.</span></p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Conclusion
    on Interpretation </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the proper interpretation of s. 33(3) requires
    that the officer must make a specific request for identification other than a
    driver’s licence.  Until that request
    for alternative identification has been made and the person has refused to
    comply, there is no contravention of the subsection.  It follows that there can be no power to arrest without a warrant
    until the officer has made the request for alternative identification. The
    appeal judge erred in law in his interpretation of s. 33(3).</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Application
    to the Facts of this Case</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the appellant did not contravene s. 33(3) and thus
    there was no power to arrest him without a warrant.  Constable Allcroft testified with admirable clarity about his
    dialogue with the appellant.  While he
    repeatedly asked the appellant to provide his licence and the appellant
    repeatedly refused, the officer did not then ask him to give some other
    reasonable identification.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have considered whether the fact that the officer also asked
    for ownership and insurance, which might provide identification,<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[7]</span></a> could constitute a request of alternative identification.  However, I conclude that it cannot. Such an
    interpretation of the demand would be inconsistent with the concluding words of
    s. 33(3), which provide that the correct name and address of the person is
    deemed to be reasonable identification.  As I have pointed out, the legislative purpose of including this phrase
    was to avoid the exercise of an unfettered discretion whereby the officer could
    determine the form of alternative identification that would be sufficient.  Further, while an officer can make a demand
    under s. 7(5) of the Act that a
    driver surrender the ownership permit for inspection, contravention of that
    provision is not an offence for which a person can be arrested without
    warrant.  Similarly, under s. 3(1) of
    the <i>Compulsory Automobile Insurance Act, </i>R.S.O.
    1990, c. C.25, the operator of a motor vehicle on a highway must carry evidence
    of insurance and a police officer may demand its surrender.  But, contravention of s. 3(1) is not an
    offence for which a person can be arrested without a warrant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the appeal judge observed, s. 33 imposes positive legal
    duties on drivers to identify themselves.  But, those duties are only triggered in the specific circumstances set
    out in ss. 33(1) and (3).  In this case,
    while the s. 33(1) duty was triggered, the s. 33(3) duty was not. The appeal
    judge said in his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A demand for the
    licence followed by a second demand and supplemented by a warning that the
    person will be arrested if s/he fails to identify herself/himself will be
    sufficient to trigger the arrest power in s. 217(2).</p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>However,
    in this case the warning Constable Allcroft gave to the appellant was tied to
    the failure to produce his licence, ownership and insurance, not to a failure
    to provide alternative identification by way of his name and address. Thus, the
    arrest power was not triggered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the version of events as testified to by the officer there
    can be little doubt that, had the request for alternative identification been
    made, the appellant would have refused to comply.  But, that is not the point.  The arrest power is a limited one and it can only be triggered if the
    officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the appellant had
    contravened s. 33(3).  Reasonable and
    probable grounds imply objective and subjective components:  <i>R. v.
    Storrey</i> (1990), 53 C.C.C. (3d) 316 (S.C.C.) at 324.  The officer not only had to believe that the
    appellant had committed an offence under s.&nbsp;33(3), but that belief had to
    be reasonable.  On the facts known to
    the officer, the appellant did not contravene s. 33 and therefore the officer
    did not have grounds to make the arrest.  Without the request, an essential element of the contravention was not
    made out.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Impact
    on the arrest</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because there was no power of arrest, the arrest of the
    appellant was unlawful.  The appeal
    judge observed in <i>obiter</i> that it
    would have been better had the appellant submitted to the arrest and not
    resorted to self-help.  No doubt, it
    would have been better, but a person is entitled to resist an unlawful arrest,
    even where the unlawful arrest is attempted by a police officer.  In the circumstances of this case, if the
    arrest was unlawful, the officer was not in the execution of his duty and thus
    the offence of assaulting an officer in the execution of his duty was not made
    out.  See <i>R. v. Delong</i> (1989), 47 C.C.C. (3d) 402 (Ont. C.A.) at 411.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, in attempting to arrest the appellant without legal
    authority, the officer unlawfully assaulted him.  The appellant was therefore not guilty of the included offence of
    assault. Section 34(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> gave him the right to resist
    the unlawful assault by the officer provided the force used was not intended to
    cause death or grievous bodily harm and was no more than necessary to defend
    himself.  There was no suggestion that
    the force used by the appellant in resisting the arrest was capable of
    depriving him of the defence in s. 34(1).  A similar analysis applies to the other charge of assault with intent to
    resist arrest.  Since the appellant was
    unlawfully assaulted he had a lawful right to resist the arrest.</p>

    agree with much of his legal analysis concerning s.&nbsp;33(1) and (3) of the <i>Highway
    Traffic Act</i>.  However, I do not
    agree with his application of the law to the facts of this case.  In my view, my colleague wrongly rejects
    clear findings of fact by both the trial judge and the summary conviction
    appeal judge.  Moreover, on the record
    in this case, the factual findings made by the judges below are strongly
    supported by the record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I begin with the observation that the trial judge found that
    the police officer’s behaviour throughout the incident was entirely
    professional whereas the appellant’s conduct was inexplicable and
    outrageous.  As expressed by the trial
    judge:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>At no place in
    his evidence did the accused say or deny he was weaving a seat belt, or deny
    the accusation that he was not wearing a seat belt.  This is the reason why the officer stopped the accused.  He saw an incident, not a major incident by
    any stretch of the imagination, and reacted to it and executed his duty but was
    met with abuse, profanity, intimidation and a level, albeit a low level, of
    violence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleague has set out the police officer’s testimony about
    the incident at paragraph&nbsp;3 of his draft reasons.  He correctly notes that the trial judge
    accepted the officer’s version of events.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The summary conviction appeal judge, Cumming&nbsp;J., assessed
    this testimony in his reasons at paras.&nbsp;28&#8209;29:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The evidentiary
    record supports a finding that there were reasonable and probable grounds for
    the officer to arrest the Appellant for a violation of s.&nbsp;33(3) of the <i>Highway
    Traffic Act</i>.  The Appellant submits
    that the only possible violation by the Appellant was in respect of
    s.&nbsp;33(1).  I disagree.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The police
    officer testified that he requested the Appellant’s licence, proof of insurance
    and ownership.  The Appellant had ample
    opportunity to produce “reasonable identification.”  The Appellant’s statements to the officer and conduct amounted to
    a refusal to produce any reasonable identification, as required by
    ss.&nbsp;33(1) and (3).  The record
    establishes the Appellant did not offer to give any reasonable identification
    of himself.  On his own evidence, he had
    a licence.  On the trial judge’s
    finding, he refused to produce any identification.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, this analysis is an eminently reasonable
    interpretation of the entire incident based on the police officer’s testimony,
    which was accepted by the trial judge and not challenged on either appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also agree with Cumming&nbsp;J.’s observation at
    para.&nbsp;33:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In my view,
    insisting that officers engage in a rigid, formulaic demand process in the
    unpredictable and dynamic environment that constitutes most traffic stops
    places too high a burden on the officer.  A demand for the licence followed by a second demand and supplemented by
    a warning that the person will be arrested if s/he fails to identify
    herself/himself will be sufficient to trigger the arrest power in
    s.&nbsp;217(2).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I want to address a final issue.  My colleague states that “in attempting to arrest the appellant
    without legal authority, the officer unlawfully assaulted the appellant.”  With respect, this turns upside down the
    actual events that unfolded on a Toronto street.  The trial judge found that the police officer’s reasonable
    request “was met with abuse, profanity, intimidation and a level, albeit a low
    level, of violence.”  He also found that
    the accused “was totally out of control”, so much so that two passersby
    intervened to assist the police officer in subduing the appellant.  In short, the appellant committed the only
    assault in this case.</p>
