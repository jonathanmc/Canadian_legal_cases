    appellant was charged with second degree murder.  After a 21-day jury trial,
    he was convicted of manslaughter.  The trial judge imposed a global sentence
    of twelve years imprisonment, less three and a half years pre-sentence detention,
    resulting in a sentence of eight and a half years imprisonment.  </p>

    the trial judge erred: (i) in finding that the appellant was not remorseful;
    (ii) in characterizing the victim as “vulnerable”; and (iii) in imposing
    a sentence of twelve years, which the appellant argues falls outside the
    appropriate range of sentence. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, the victim and others were attending a field party after a high
    school graduation.  The appellant, who the trial judge found was “looking
    for trouble”, initiated two confrontations during the course of the party.  One
    confrontation involved insulting and spitting on the victim’s girlfriend.  In
    a fistfight that followed, during which the victim threw the first punch,
    the appellant stabbed the victim eight times in the torso, resulting in the
    victim’s death.  The victim was unarmed and had no knowledge that the appellant
    carried a weapon.  The weapon was a prohibited weapon, namely, a butterfly
    knife with a five-inch blade that the appellant had concealed on his person
    and that he had been ready to use in the earlier altercation at the party. </p>

    referred to this as a case of “aggravated”
    manslaughter for which the usual range of sentence is eight to twelve years: <i>R.
    v. Clarke</i>, [2003] O.J. No. 1966 (C.A).  The trial judge concluded that
    the verdict of manslaughter demonstrated a reasonable doubt on the question
    of intent; however, the appellant’s moral blameworthiness was very high and,
    in the trial judge’s view, the case was close to one of murder. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    fashioning an appropriate sentence, the trial judge considered the appellant’s
    youth (nineteen at the time of the offence), his family support, his employment
    record, his prospects for rehabilitation, his pre-trial custody, and evidence
    of his good character while in pre-trial custody.  He also found that the
    appellant’s purported remorse was not meaningful. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    aggravating factors, the trial judge considered the vulnerability of the
    victim, the appellant’s youth record, including his convictions for assault
    and threatening, the impact of the crime on the victim and his family, the
    brutality of the attack and the appellant’s after-the-fact conduct in fleeing
    the scene. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    the appellant’s remorse, his characterization of the victim as
    “vulnerable” and the global sentence imposed.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are not persuaded that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence of remorse
    or made an error in principle in his assessment of this evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence of remorse consisted of the following.  The appellant’s psychiatrist
    testified that he considered the appellant to be remorseful because the appellant
    was sorrowful about the pain he caused the victim’s family and appreciated
    that he must bear the consequences for his conduct. A corrections officer
    testified about a mid-trial conversation with the appellant, in which the
    appellant expressed regret and remorse, including his wish that he had not
    had a knife with him during the evening in question.   As well, at his sentencing
    hearing, the appellant told the court of his remorse for what had happened
    and the pain he had caused.  However, he also maintained that he told the
    truth at trial in stating that he had acted in self-defence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge acknowledged the evidence about remorse, but concluded that the
    appellant’s expressions of remorse were not genuine.  The trial judge was
    entitled to conclude that the appellant did not accept responsibility for
    his actions.  This failure was sufficient to negative the appellant’s expressions
    of sorrow for the harm caused to the victim and the victim’s family.  In
    these circumstances, we see no error in the trial judge’s finding that the
    appellant’s remorse was not “such that it could properly be considered a
    mitigating factor”. </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>(b) Characterization of the Victim as “Vulnerable”</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge referred to the “vulnerability” of the victim as an aggravating
    factor. In referring to the victim as “vulnerable”, he relied on <i>R. v.
    Garrison</i>, [1999] O.J. No. 3782 (C.A.) and <i>R. v. Clarke</i>, [2003]
    O.J. No. 1966 (C.A.) as supporting the need for denunciation of attacks on
    the vulnerable, specifically, the elderly and the frail.  Although the trial
    judge noted that the victim in this case was young and healthy, he explained
    that the victim was “vulnerable as a consequence of being unarmed and unaware
    that Mr. Cleyndert was armed with a weapon that he was prepared to use”.  The
    trial judge was clearly alive to the circumstances of this victim and, in
    our opinion, did not err in considering the appellant’s use of a concealed
    prohibited weapon in a fistfight with an unarmed man as an aggravating factor
    on sentencing. </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>(c) Sentence Imposed</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    we do not accept the appellant’s argument that the sentence of twelve years
    imprisonment was outside the range for an “aggravated”
    manslaughter.  Sentences for this offence have ranged from eight to twelve
    years depending on a number of factors.  In <i>Clarke, supra</i>, a sentence
    of twelve years was imposed where the accused entered the deceased’s residence,
    attacked the frail victim and left him to die.  A sentence of twelve years
    was also imposed in <i>R. v. E.B.</i>, [2002] O.J. No. 5536 (S.C.J.), which
    involved a forcible confinement, prolonged beatings and leaving the victim
    in a remote cabin.  Sentences at the low end of the range have been imposed
    in the presence of other mitigating factors, including a guilty plea. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the circumstances of this case differ from those in <i>Clarke</i> and <i>E.B.</i>,
    each case must be decided on its own facts.  In this case, the appellant
    inflicted multiple stab wounds in a cluster on a vulnerable part of the victim’s
    body (his torso).  Several of those wounds were life threatening.  Moreover,
    the fatal attack occurred in circumstances where the appellant was looking
    for a fight, was armed with a concealed prohibited weapon, was prepared from
    the outset to use that weapon, and in fact did use it repeatedly on an unarmed
    man who had approached the incident as a fistfight.  In all these circumstances,
    we see no basis to interfere with the trial judge’s conclusion that the circumstances
    of this offence placed it at the high end of the appropriate range of sentence.  </p>
