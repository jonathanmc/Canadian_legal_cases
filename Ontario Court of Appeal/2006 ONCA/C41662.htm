    2001 the respondents, Menard and Fournier (who has since died) together with
    a third accused, Bergeron, were jointly charged with fraud. The charges related
    to the issuance of alleged native status cards by the League of Independent
    Indian Nations of North American (“LINNA”).</p>

    July 2003 Menard and Fournier filed a Notice of Constitutional Question in
    the Superior Court challenging the jurisdiction of the court to prosecute
    them, on the basis of their aboriginal heritage. Their counsel Mr. Swinwood
    then made an application on their behalf for the funding by the Crown of
    their defence, including this constitutional issue.  He submitted a proposed
    budget of $35,000 for his fees at his hourly rate of $200 plus experts’ fees.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the course of the hearing of the funding application, it came to light, that
    neither Fournier or Menard had applied for legal aid.  The trial judge suggested
    that Legal Aid be contacted.  (In doing so, the trial judge was following
    the dictates of <i>R. v. Rowbotham</i> (1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 1, (Ont. C.A.)
    although he did not specifically refer to this decision.)</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Legal
    Aid advised that if the respondents applied and met the financial qualifications,
    it would provide funding for the experts as well as legal fees at legal aid
    rates of $92 an hour for an estimated total of $17,500, or one-half the amount
    budgeted.  Mr. Swinwood advised the trial judge of Legal Aid’s position,
    but continued to pursue his funding application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    March 12, 2004, the trial judge made an order against the Crown for funding
    of $17,500 regardless of what legal aid might ultimately do, and also ordered
    the Crown to pay the costs of the funding application which he fixed in the
    amount of $2,500.  The Crown appeals that order.  In the meantime the prosecution
    proceeded.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the funding application, Bergeron, who had been separately represented and
    who had a legal aid certificate, dismissed his counsel and retained Mr. Swinwood.
    Throughout the litigation in the trial court, legal aid was thus provided
    to Mr. Swinwood, who represented all three accused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    February 7, 2006, after 20 days of hearing, the trial proceedings concluded.
    The accused formally acknowledged that the Crown nor any government recognized
    the LINNA card as establishing in or of itself that the cardholder possessed
    or could exercise Aboriginal or treaty rights. They agreed that they would
    make that clear in the future.  They also agreed that in order to prevent
    any misunderstanding on the part of LINNA members, government officials and
    merchants they would take certain steps to provide notice of their acknowledgement
    and to change the language on existing and future promotional materials prepared
    for LINNA.  In return, the Crown agreed to participate in a without prejudice “reconciliation
    circle” with the accused and other participants. On that basis the Crown
    concluded that a stay of proceedings was appropriate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the outset of this appeal, Mr. Swinwood advised the court that he was not
    seeking to be paid the $17,500 awarded by the trial judge.  He accepted what
    he had received from Legal Aid as full payment for his fees, and also conceded
    that the order that the Crown pay $2,500 was improper.  He maintained, however,
    that the trial judge had not erred in making the funding order for payment
    of $17,500.00 and sought to uphold it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    is now apparent, the funding of the defence, including the constitutional
    issues raised, was available from Legal Aid and, in fact, those funds were
    paid. This, to us, clearly demonstrates that there was no basis for the trial
    judge’s funding order.  The procedure that ought to have been followed in
    the circumstances of this case is the one set out in <i>R. v. Rowbotham</i> (1988),
    41 C.C.C. (3d) p. 1 (Ont. C.A.) and confirmed in <i>R. v. Peterman</i>, [2004]
    O.J. 1758.  These stand for the proposition that, in criminal matters such
    as the present case, before seeking relief from the court in the nature of
    a funding order, the defendants must apply to the Legal Aid Plan for available
    funding or demonstrate that that would be futile. This was not done and,
    for that reason, the trial judge erred and the funding order and the order
    for costs of the funding application must be set aside.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    making his funding order, the trial judge briefly assessed the underlying
    merits of the case.  Although we have serious doubts as to whether the trial
    judge was correct in this assessment and we note that he did not carry out
    a detailed legal analysis of the issues as was done in the decision in <i>R.
    v. Yellowhorn</i>, [2006] A. J. No. 491, we need not deal with this aspect
    of his decision in light of the conclusion we have reached on the procedure
    that ought to have been followed. We do note that in the end the parties
    appear to have reached a reasonable accommodation, which seems a much better
    outcome than seeking to have a court decide questions that may be ill-suited
    to judicial resolution.</p>
