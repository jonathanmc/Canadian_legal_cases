      that the offences, which involved one act of sexual intercourse, occurred
      when the appellant was sixteen years old and the complainant was twelve.  The
      appellant, who is now age thirty-six, also appeals his sentence of six
      months secure custody, three months community supervision and fifteen months
      probation, a sentence imposed under the <i>Youth Criminal Justice Act</i>,

      mother, he began living with and later married Nancy H., who had been the
      family babysitter.  The appellant resented this relationship. </span></p>

      complainant) and the complainant’s brother.  The appellant’s half brother
      and half sister also resided periodically with the new family.  The appellant
      lived with the family for lengthy periods, interrupted by other periods
      when he lived with his mother. </span></p>

      all accounts, the appellant moved between his biological parents’ homes
      five to ten times when he was between six and sixteen years of age.  These
      moves were usually initiated by one of his biological parents when the
      appellant’s conduct became too disruptive for the particular household
      to manage.  As a result of the appellant’s frequent problem behaviour,
      including unacceptable and alarming temper tantrums, the complainant came
      to dislike him intensely.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      one of the appellant’s lengthy absences, the complainant’s mother and Barry
      H. told the complainant that the appellant would be returning to live with
      the family.  While the complainant objected and threatened to run away,
      her mother and stepfather, with whom she was close, persuaded her to give
      the appellant another chance.  They assured her that he had changed his
      ways.  The complainant acquiesced.</span></p>

      to the complainant, the appellant sexually assaulted her the morning after
      his return.  The complainant provided what the trial judge described as
      a “bare bones account” of the assault.  The complainant and the appellant
      were alone in the house.  After taking her morning shower, the complainant
      returned to her bedroom wrapped in a towel.  The appellant came to her
      door “arguing about how I had taken his father away from him.  Telling
      me how he was going to make me hurt like I made him hurt over his dad.”  The
      complainant testified that the appellant threw her on her bed, grabbed
      her wrists, held her hands above her head, forced himself on top of her
      and had intercourse with her.  The appellant threatened to hurt her if
      she told and, a short while later, left the room.  She told no one.  The
      complainant could provide little further detail about the assault.  </span></p>

      complainant testified that she ran away from home the same day as the assault
      and lived on the streets for the next six years.  From the mother’s perspective,
      the complainant left home because “she got into a bad crowd” and was stealing.  As
      the complainant’s mother recalled events, the complainant only left home
      a year later and, at least initially, lived at home about 25% of the time.  During
      the years the complainant was away, she developed problems with alcohol
      and drugs.  As well, she was convicted of forgery in 1991 and fraud in
      1996 and again in 1998.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When
      the complainant was sixteen, her mother visited a psychic to learn why
      her daughter had gone from being a  “good” to a “really nasty” person.  As
      a result of that visit, the mother asked the complainant whether she had
      been hurt by a male.  The complainant said that she had been and identified
      that male as the appellant.  She provided no particulars other than to
      say that she did not want to pursue any complaint.  After this conversation
      with her mother, the complainant entered drug and alcohol treatment.  She
      did not complain to the police about the sexual assault, which was alleged
      to have occurred in either 1986 or 1987, until 1999. </span></p>

      trial, the complainant testified that she feared the appellant because
      she witnessed the mental abuse his conduct caused her family.  The Crown
      led evidence of the appellant’s disruptive behaviour, including his temper
      tantrums. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      the complainant, specifically:</span></p>
  <p>1.            <span style='font-size:13.0pt'>When the complainant was five
      or six years old, the appellant asked her to place his penis in her mouth
      and she did so.  The complainant testified that this took place in a closet

  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent align=left style='

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the complainant was eight to ten years of age, the appellant placed crystal
    drink powder between her legs.  The powder burned.  The appellant placed
    his face between the complainant’s legs “to clean it up.”  However, because
    the powder hurt so much, the complainant got up and washed it off.  </p>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent align=left style='text-align:left;'>The complainant
    did not testify to any element of physical coercion in these incidents. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      complainant also testified that the earlier sexual activity did not lead
      her to fear that the appellant would sexually assault her when he moved
      back into the house. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      complainant’s mother was not aware of the two incidents recited by the
      complainant, but testified that she was aware of a third incident that
      the complainant did not remember.  That incident occurred when the complainant
      was three or four years old and the appellant was seven or eight.  At that
      time, the mother walked into the master bedroom and saw the appellant licking
      the complainant’s vagina.  The appellant was told that his behaviour was
      wrong and that it was not to be repeated.  The complainant was told to
      tell her mother if anything like that ever happened again.  The mother
      agreed that this incident was an isolated one that could be characterized
      as juvenile sexual experimentation.  As a result of this incident, the
      mother testified, she did not leave the complainant and the appellant alone
      in the house.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      mother confirmed the complainant’s evidence about the appellant’s disruptive
      behaviour.  One particular occasion remained prominent in her mind, although
      she was unable to pinpoint the appellant’s age at the time of this incident
      beyond saying that he could have been ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen or
      fourteen.  On that occasion, after an altercation about washing the dishes,
      the appellant locked himself in a bathroom.  The mother called her brother
      to come over to the house to help.  She also telephoned her mother and
      father, as well as a friend of the appellant.  When the appellant refused
      to come out of the bathroom, the tension escalated.  The family tried to
      force the appellant out by removing the hinges from the bathroom door.  In
      response, the appellant yelled out the bathroom window that his family
      was trying to kill him.  The appellant found a knife that was in the bathroom
      for construction purposes and stuck it through the gap at the side of the
      door, warning everyone to leave him alone.  The appellant’s stepmother
      testified that the knife narrowly missed her.  The complainant was present
      at the time of this incident.  Both mother and daughter attested to the
      incident as an example of the appellant’s out of control behaviour.  The
      complainant testified that the incident increased her fear of the appellant. </span></p>

    assault] and to support the way in which the complainant reacted and the

      a four-stage inquiry: whether the proposed evidence was: (i) the conduct
      of the accused; (ii) relevant and material; (iii) discreditable to the
      accused; and (iv) probative to the extent that its probative value outweighed
      its prejudicial effect.  Counsel agreed that the first and third criteria

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      the second criterion, relevance, the Crown argued that the evidence would “contextualize” the
      complainant’s relationship with the appellant, specifically their sexual
      history.  The knife incident, the Crown argued, was relevant to the atmosphere
      in the home, the way the complainant responded to that atmosphere, why
      the appellant wanted to hurt the complainant as the favoured child, and
      why the complainant waited so many years to bring the assault to the attention
      of the police.  The Crown also argued that all the incidents were relevant
      to the appellant’s motive or <i>animus</i> toward<span style='color:red'> </span>the<span

      response, the appellant argued that the proposed evidence showed only a
      few isolated incidents and did not disclose a pattern of conduct that reflected
      on his ongoing relationship with the complainant.  Moreover, the appellant
      argued, the incidents might be characterized more accurately as juvenile
      sexual experimentation and not as sexually assaultive conduct indicative
      of <i>animus</i>.  Finally, the appellant argued that the evidence was
      highly prejudicial and lacked any similarity to the complainant’s allegations
      of forced sexual intercourse.</span></p>

      trial judge’s reasons begin with her consideration of the similar fact
      evidence.  She repeated that she had admitted that evidence for the limited
      purpose of assessing credibility and providing context.  She found that
      this evidence was “valuable in considering what [the complainant’s] relationship
      was with [the appellant]”, that the earlier sexual contact was capable
      of showing that the complainant was
    “uncomfortable with and afraid of [the appellant] when he was in the home” and
    that the incidents “explain the context of the relationship and the living
    situation and… explain why the complainant and the accused may have behaved
    in a particular way.”  The trial judge found that all the incidents caused
    the complainant to be afraid of the appellant and explained her delay in
    disclosure.</span></p>

      discreditably in the past, he is likely to have done so on this occasion.  This
      propensity reasoning may shift the jury’s focus away from the offence with
      which the accused is charged and “may also capture the attention of the
      trier of fact to an unwarranted degree”, resulting in a trial of the accused

      the Crown sought to introduce similar fact evidence for a different purpose:
      to bolster the complainant’s credibility on a sexual assault charge where
      the complainant alleged that, while she consented to vaginal sex with the
      accused, she did not consent to the accused punching and choking her in
      the course of that sex.  Specifically, the Crown proposed that the accused’s

      was upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada, which conducted a thorough review
      of the admissibility of similar fact evidence where the identity of the
      perpetrator is not the primary issue.  The Supreme Court confirmed that
      the exception to the inadmissibility of similar fact evidence is a narrow
      one, which is available only where the Crown shows that the particular
      evidence is relevant and material and its probative value outweighs its
      prejudicial effect.  In determining the admissibility of similar fact evidence,
      it is important to identify the “issue in question” to which the similar
      fact evidence is said to be relevant.  Credibility, the court cautioned,
      may be too broad a gateway to serve as the “issue in question”: see <i>Handy</i>, <i>supra</i>,

      I have said, in this case, the trial judge held that the similar fact evidence

      the relationship between the complainant and the appellant, the context,
      motive, <i>animus</i>, the appellant’s relationship of violence with his

      numerous purposes of admission enumerated by the trial judge do not convey
      clearly the issue to which the evidence of the earlier sexual conduct was
      relevant.  The fact that the complainant was telling the truth about the
      earlier sexual conduct could be relevant either because that earlier conduct
      lent credence to her explanation for her delayed reporting of the later
      sexual assault or because the earlier conduct made it more likely that
      she was telling the truth about the later sexual assault.</span></p>

      earlier conduct, however, could not be relevant to the delayed reporting
      because the complainant did not testify that the earlier sexual incidents
      made her fear the appellant.  To the contrary, she testified that her fear
      of the appellant arose from his violent temper tantrums in the home, including
      the knife incident.  Accordingly, the earlier sexual conduct was not admissible
      to explain the delayed reporting.  </span></p>

      the complainant’s truthfulness in her evidence about the earlier conduct
      was seen as supporting her truthfulness about the later sexual assault.  However,
      the Crown is not allowed to lead evidence about the complainant’s truthfulness
      on matters not relevant but only collateral to the charges at issue.  Accordingly,
      to be admissible, the evidence had to be relevant for some other permissible

      reason must be that the earlier sexual conduct was so similar to the later
      sexual assault that it rendered it more likely that the later assault took
      place.  In other words, the complainant’s credibility about the earlier
      conduct enhanced her credibility that the later assault occurred because
      the similarity of the incidents could not be coincidental.  </span></p>

      a reading of the trial judge’s reasons indicates that she used her finding
      that the complainant was credible about the earlier sexual activity to
      conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant committed this offence.  Although
      framed as relevant to credibility generally, it appears the trial judge
      concluded that, since the appellant engaged in the earlier sexual activity,
      he committed the offences at issue.  This propensity reasoning is not available
      when the earlier conduct is not sufficiently similar to the assault charged.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
      there were significant dissimilarities between the earlier conduct and
      the offences charged.  The trial judge, as did the trial judge in <i>Handy</i>,
      paid “insufficient attention to the dissimilarities.”  See <i>Handy</i>, <i>supra</i>,
      at para. 123.  The earlier conduct was similar to the offences alleged
      only to the extent that both involved sexual conduct in the children’s
      home when they were alone in a room together.  </span></p>

      of the earlier acts involved intercourse.  Importantly, none of the earlier
      acts involved a vindictive attack by the appellant on the complainant because
      he was jealous about her close relationship with his father.  As well,
      none of the earlier acts involved physical coercion.  Moreover, the evidence
      as a whole suggested that one or two, if not all three, of the earlier
      acts could be properly characterized as juvenile sexual experimentation
      and were not indicative of a propensity for aggressive sexual conduct on
      the part of the appellant.  Simply put, there is no distinct unifying feature
      connecting the earlier acts to the forced sexual intercourse alleged.</span></p>

      intervening events between the earlier acts and the offences charged serve
      to distinguish the nature and purpose of the appellant’s conduct.  All
      the earlier events occurred while the appellant was residing more regularly
      with the family as an accepted (albeit difficult) member of that family.  The
      sexual assault at issue was alleged to have happened the day after the
      appellant returned to the family home<span

      the complainant had openly expressed her objection to his return and the
      complainant and the appellant had developed an overtly negative relationship.   </span></p>

      the three earlier acts all occurred years before the complainant reached
      puberty and, for the most part, before the appellant reached puberty.  Neither

      of three assaults alleged to have occurred during a two-week period.  The
      Crown called evidence about the nature of the relationship between the

      the evidence about the domination exerted by the husband during the marriage

      in <i>R. (B.S.)</i> the complainant’s evidence relating to the prior conduct
      was much more detailed than the evidence in question here and was supported
      to some extent by medical evidence.  While the trial judge here did not
      doubt that the prior acts, in fact, had occurred, it must be remembered
