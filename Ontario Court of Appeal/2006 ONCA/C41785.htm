  <p class=MsoBodyText>On appeal from the conviction entered by Justice Nick

    the sentence imposed by Justice Nick Borkovich dated March 1, 2004.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>MACFARLAND J.A.:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is an appeal by the appellant from his conviction for second degree murder
    on February 13, 2004, after trial before Borkovich J. and a jury, and from
    the life sentence imposed on March 1, 2004, with no eligibility for parole
    for 14 years.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>Conviction Appeal</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raises five grounds of appeal in support of his conviction appeal.
    First, he submits that the trial judge erred in his instruction to the jury
    on proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellant concedes that the language
    used in the charge by the trial judge conforms to the language of the model
    charge as set out in <i>R. v. Lifchus </i> (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.)
    at 14. He says, however, in this case more is required. It is not enough
    to say what proof beyond a reasonable doubt is not. A trial judge is obliged,
    particularly in a circumstantial case such as this one, to also say what
    a reasonable doubt is.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge, in his charge, adopted entirely the suggested language of Cory
    J. in <i>Lifchus</i>, <i>supra</i>. He said both what a reasonable doubt
    was and what it was not. He was not obliged to do more. I would not give
    effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second ground of appeal relates to the evidence of the appellant’s after-the-fact
    conduct. The appellant says, firstly, that this evidence was inadmissible
    in that its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value. Secondly,
    he says that if the evidence was properly admissible, the trial judge’s charge
    to the jury in relation to the use to be made of this evidence was inadequate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the Crown led evidence that the accused, nine months after the disappearance
    of  his wife (the victim) and before he had been told by the authorities
    that his wife had been killed in suspicious circumstances, had purchased
    a one-way ticket for himself and his two children to Guyana. This occurred
    two days after a 90 minute meeting he had with the police about his wife’s
    disappearance. The police called and asked to speak with him further. Before
    such a meeting took place, the appellant left work and took his children
    out of school. He asked a travel agent for one-way tickets to Guyana as soon
    as possible for himself and his children and booked a flight for the following
    evening.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to the flight arrangements, he accelerated his efforts to liquidate
    his assets: he tried to sell his house and the contents thereof and his car,
    and withdrew cash from his RRSP.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the day of the flight, in the morning before 6:00 a.m., he enlisted the assistance
    of one of his tenants to lift his children over a backyard fence to evade
    police he was sure were watching his home. He left his car in plain view
    in the front of the house and paid a virtual stranger $20.00 to drive him
    and the children to a nearby GO station. He took a cab to his place of employment
    where he entered through the front but left through the backdoor with the
    children. He briefly checked into a hotel near his home. He was arrested
    that evening at the airport before boarding a plane bound for Guyana.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    all this conduct occurred some nine months after the disappearance of the
    appellant’s wife, it followed in very close proximity to the renewed interest
    of the police in the case (the victim’s body by then having been found and
    identified) and in the appellant, in particular.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    evidence was clearly admissible. It was relevant because it suggested circumstantially
    that the appellant may have had some involvement in the disappearance and/or
    murder of his wife and that he was attempting to avoid detection of this
    by the police.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the Supreme Court of Canada noted in <i>White v. The Queen and Côté</i> <i>v.
    The Queen</i> (1998), 125 C.C.C. (3d) 385 at 400:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            Whether a jury should be permitted
    to consider evidence of post-offence conduct will depend on the facts of
    each case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his charge, the trial judge carefully reviewed the evidence of the appellant’s
    after-the-fact conduct. He told the jury that such conduct may help it decide
    who committed the crime or it may not. He offered other innocent explanations
    for the appellant’s conduct. He also pointed out that only after the jury
    concluded that the appellant had in fact done what the Crown alleged, and
    that such conduct was consistent with the appellant being conscious of what
    the Crown alleged against him – and not for any other innocent purpose, then
    and only then could the jury consider such evidence, together with all the
    other evidence in reaching its verdict. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the trial judge’s instruction on the permissible use of the evidence
    of the appellant’s after-the-fact conduct was unobjectionable in the circumstances.
    Indeed, parts of that instruction were decidedly favourable to the defence
    because they explicitly drew the attention of the jury to the innocent explanations
    offered by the defence for the appellant’s after-the-fact conduct. Accordingly,
    I would give no effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third ground of appeal challenges the reasonableness of the verdict. With
    his usual candour, Mr. Koziebrocki conceded that he would be hard-pressed
    to argue this ground of appeal. I agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    the appellant says the trial judge failed to review all the evidence favourable
    to the defence in his charge. He says because this was a factually complex
    and circumstantial case, the trial judge had a duty to review all this evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    note that the trial judge’s charge took place the morning following the detailed
    and extensive closing jury addresses of both the Crown and the defence. The
    trial, by present day standards, was a relatively short one – some 18 days.
    It was reasonable in these circumstances for the trial judge to assume that
    the evidence was fresh in the minds of the jurors and, in my view, the trial
    judge’s review of the evidence for the jury was adequate. The charge, it
    is conceded, was favourable to the defence. In the circumstances, this ground
    of appeal must also fail.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lastly,
    the appellant argues that the trial judge did not adequately deal with a
    question posed by the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About
    two hours into their deliberations, the jury asked if it could have a transcript
    of the entire trial and, if not, then of the evidence of four witnesses whom
    the jury named.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    hearing submissions of counsel, the trial judge informed the jury that it
    could not have a transcript of the entire trial. In relation to the evidence
    of the four specific witnesses, while the trial judge was prepared to provide
    them with that evidence defence counsel expressed his concern that providing  the
    transcript of the one witness that was available and playing back the entire
    evidence of the other three (of which transcripts were not available) would
    tend to over-emphasize the evidence of those four witnesses over that of
    the other witnesses who testified.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge acquiesced to the submission of defence counsel and said to the
    jury in relation to this evidence and with the concurrence of defence counsel:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[I]f you have specific points that you are concerned
    about in the witness’ testimony, if you put those in a question as to what
    you want to hear and give it to us, I will then get that question and it
    can either be read to you or perhaps it can be played back to you. But, holus
    bolus just to provide you with all of this information is just not within
    our realm of possibility. So, if you like, we are going to take the lunch
    hour now. If over the lunch hour you have specific bits of evidence you want
    to have replayed to you or reheard, let us know by way of your questions
    and we will call everybody back and we will try to get those answers for
    you.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some
    time later the court was informed by the jury that it was happy with the
    circumstances and if it needed something it would come back and ask for it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jury retired to consider its verdict at 12:55 p.m. and reached a verdict
    the following day at 3:25 p.m.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    view of the message that the jury left for the court, there was no obligation
    on the trial judge to do more. It is apparent from its message that the jury
    was fully aware that if it wished anything more it could return to ask for
    it. In the circumstances, nothing more was required. The defence counsel
    opposed giving the jury the evidence at trial for tactical or strategic reasons
    as significant parts of that evidence were not favourable to the defence
    position. While the defence position is not determinative, it is indicative
    of the fact that no prejudice was occasioned to the defence as a result.
    I would give no effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would dismiss the appeal as to conviction.</p>

      appellant seeks leave to appeal his sentence and, in particular, the 14

      into consideration the factors that s. 745.4 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>requires.
      He gave clear reasons why parole ineligibility should be increased from
      10 to 14 years. The sentence is within the range imposed in like cases.
