style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals from his convictions on four counts of possession of a
    controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking. He also appeals from
    sentence, but only as regards the forfeiture order made by the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal from conviction is largely fact driven. We can find no error in the
    trial judge’s s. 9 <i>Charter</i> analysis (arbitrary detention and arrest).
    It was open to the trial judge to find, as she did, that Sergeant Nichol
    stopped the appellant due to legitimate road safety concerns and not, as
    the appellant maintained, as “a pretext to retrospectively justify the stop”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Likewise,
    it was open to the trial judge to find that after the appellant had been
    stopped, he engaged in various forms of conduct that provided Sergeant Nolan
    with reasonable grounds to arrest him for failing to identify himself under
    s. 33 of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8 (“<i>HTA</i>”)
    and attempting to obstruct justice by providing a false name.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s chief complaint relates to the trial judge’s s. 8 <i>Charter </i>analysis
    (unreasonable search and seizure). The s. 8 issue arises from the police
    search of the vehicle being driven by the appellant as an incident of his
    lawful arrest. The police claimed that their sole purpose for searching the
    vehicle was to find evidence of the appellant’s true identity. The appellant,
    on the other hand, maintained that the alleged search for evidence of identity
    was a mere pretext; what the police were really searching for was drugs and
    they had no right to do so as an incident of his arrest because he had not
    been arrested for a drug or drug related offence.  Accordingly, the search
    violated his s. 8 privacy rights.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    support of his position that the police were not being truthful when they
    claimed that they were searching for evidence of identity, the appellant
    contended that the police already knew who he was before they commenced their
    search of the car. Alternatively, he maintained that if they had a lingering
    doubt about his identity, they had no reasonable basis for thinking that
    a search of the car might yield evidence of his true identity because they
    knew that the car was not registered in his name.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that at the time of the search, the police “would have
    been quite certain that the [appellant] was not who he said he was, but was,
    in fact, the brother of the owner of the vehicle”. With that in mind, she
    found it “unlikely”, despite the police evidence to the contrary, that “their <i>sole</i> reason
    to search was to find identifying documents”
    (emphasis added). In her view however, even if the police were searching
    solely for drugs, the search would have been lawful because the police had
    reason to believe that drugs might be found in the car. Accordingly, they
    were entitled to search for drugs as an incident of the appellant’s arrest.  With
    respect, we cannot accept that aspect of the trial judge’s analysis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the facts of this case, the police had no right to search for drugs as an
    incident of the appellant’s arrest because the appellant had not been arrested
    for a drug or drug related offence; he had been arrested for failing to identify
    himself and for attempting to obstruct justice by providing the police with
    a false name. Accordingly, any search for evidence incident to his arrest
    had to be restricted to evidence of identification; it could not spill over
    into a search for drugs. To the extent that the trial judge held otherwise,
    we respectfully disagree with her analysis. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    said, we consider the error to be harmless. Taking the case for the appellant
    at its highest, it is apparent to us that the trial judge was prepared to
    find that the police probably had two purposes for searching the car, one
    relating to the identity of the appellant, the other to the possible discovery
    of drugs. That finding, of course, is fatal to the appellant. So long as
    one of the purposes for searching the vehicle was proper as an incident of
    his arrest, the search itself was lawful. (See <i>R. v. Annett</i> (1984),
    17 C.C.C. (3d) 332 (Ont. C.A.); leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused March 4,
    1985).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    reject the appellant’s argument that the search for identification evidence
    was unnecessary because the police already knew his identity. The trial judge
    made no such finding. On the contrary, she found that although the police “would
    have been quite certain [who the appellant was]”, they were not sure of his
    identity and in the words of Sergeant Nichol, this was “not a guessing game”.
    Likewise, we reject the appellant’s alternate submission that the police
    had no reasonable basis for thinking that they might find identification
    evidence in the vehicle. In our view, it was perfectly reasonable for them
    to think that there might be a wallet, a briefcase or perhaps a cardholder
    in the car containing evidence of the appellant’s identity.  Furthermore,
    the area in which the drugs were found (around the floor mat underneath the
    armrest that separated the two front seats) was one where a wallet or cardholder
    could reasonably be expected to have been located.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    follows that the search for identification evidence was a valid search incident
    to the appellant’s arrest. Accordingly, the trial judge correctly concluded
    that the search did not violate the appellant’s s. 8 <i>Charter</i> rights.
    We would therefore reject this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant further submits that the verdict was unreasonable. In essence,
    he maintains that the circumstantial evidence was insufficient to prove that
    he had knowledge of the drugs. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree. The appellant testified and claimed that he had no knowledge of
    the drugs found in the vehicle. The trial judge disbelieved his evidence.
    She gave cogent reasons for doing so and we see no basis for interfering
    with her credibility findings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    remainder of the evidence, in our view, was sufficient to warrant a finding
    of knowledge in accordance with the criminal standard of proof. The appellant
    was found with two bundles of cash in his pockets and a pager. He was obviously
    familiar with his brother’s car and he exhibited signs of anxiety and provided
    Sergeant Nichol with a false name when he was stopped. The trial judge was
    entitled to take all of those factors into consideration in arriving at her
    conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Admittedly,
    the case for the Crown on the issue of knowledge was not overwhelming; in
    our view however, it was sufficient to sustain a conviction. Accordingly,
    we would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the sentence appeal, we note that the appellant’s explanation
    for being in possession of the two bundles of cash was rejected. Absent an
    innocent explanation and taking into account the expert testimony on the
    issue, we think it was open to the trial judge, in the circumstances, to
    conclude that most of the money came from the sale of illicit drugs. Accordingly,
    we would not intervene. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, we would dismiss the appeal from both conviction and sentence.</p>
