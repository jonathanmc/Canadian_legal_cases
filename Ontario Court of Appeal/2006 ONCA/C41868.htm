    appellant was convicted of sexual assault and sexual touching following a
    jury trial.  The complainant, the appellant’s stepdaughter, was fourteen
    years old at the time of the alleged assault.  She gave birth to a child
    and there was powerful DNA evidence that the accused was the father of the
    child.  The accused testified and denied having had sexual contact with the
    complainant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in failing to give an adequate
    caution with regard to the complainant’s evidence of an earlier incident
    of sexual touching.  The complainant’s evidence relating to the earlier incident
    was to the effect that under pressure from the appellant she had withdrawn
    her complaint.  The trial judge cautioned the jury that this evidence was
    not “relevant…to the character of the accused”
    and “not an admissible fact to judge his character by in this proceeding”.  The
    trial judge also cautioned the jury that the allegation of a past sexual
    act had not been proven and in a later portion of his charge, he instructed
    the jury that they were not to use evidence of prior convictions as evidence
    that the appellant was more likely to commit criminal acts in general.  While
    it might have been preferable for the trial judge to have given a more direct
    and specific caution with respect to this incident, given the nature of this
    evidence, the purpose for which it was used in the context of the trial as
    a whole, and reading the charge in its entirety, we are not persuaded that
    there was any material error to the prejudice of the appellant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in failing to provide an adequate
    answer to a question asked by the jury.  After some period of deliberation
    the jury asked a series of questions.  The question at issue was: “Does the
    jury need to consider the credibility of exactly how, when and where the
    alleged events took place, as part of the determination of the verdict regarding
    the charges?” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge stated that he was not sure what that question meant, but that
    it may have been dealt with in his answers to two additional questions posed
    by the jury.  In answer to those questions, the trial judge indicated that
    if the jury found that there was sexual intercourse between the accused and
    the complainant during the dates set out in the indictment, that activity
    would satisfy the necessary elements of the offence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not accept the submission that the trial judge failed to deal with the
    jury’s question.  Throughout his charge the trial judge instructed the jury
    that they were to consider all the evidence, including the evidence of the
    complainant.  We do not agree that his answers to the jury’s questions left
    the jury with the impression that they could disregard the complainant’s
    account of how the sexual assault actually occurred and still find the appellant
    guilty.  Nor did he err by instructing the jury that it was open to them
    to convict if they found there was sexual intercourse during the period alleged
    in the indictment.</p>
