      respondent was convicted by a jury of manslaughter in the death of his
      landlady, Ms. Gillian Fleming. The killing was particularly vicious. The
      victim, a woman in her early 60s, was stabbed 107 times all over her body
      and also sustained a blunt force injury to her head.  She had twenty-five
      defensive wounds, indicating a significant struggle. The respondent killed
      her shortly after she told him that he had to move out so that another
      tenant, who was able to pay the rent, could move in.</span></p>

      jury’s verdict of manslaughter rather than murder indicates that they accepted
      or had a reasonable doubt that the respondent committed the offence while
      under the influence of alcohol and was sufficiently intoxicated to lack
      the requisite intent for murder.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      respondent was sentenced to a total of 11 years. He was credited with 6.5
      years for the 2 years and 8 months he served in pre-trial custody, somewhat
      more than the standard two-for-one credit because of the Toronto jail conditions
      during that time. His net sentence was therefore 4.5 years. The Crown says
      that the sentence imposed is manifestly unfit and seeks a total sentence
      of 18 to 20 years imprisonment.</span></p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      respondent was in his early 40s when he committed the offence. He had been
      married twice and had three children, but by 2001 his second wife had left
      him, he had sustained an injury that prevented him from working, he had
      financial difficulties and he had a significant alcohol problem. It was
      after the breakdown of his second marriage that he became a tenant in the
      home of the victim, a widow who, because of financial difficulties of her
      own, was obliged to take tenants into her home following the death of her
      husband. The evidence suggested that the two people had become friends,
      although she had told him that she was evicting him because she needed
      a tenant who could pay the rent.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      sentencing judge described the victim and the offence in the following
      manner:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>From all accounts, Gillian Fleming, a recent pensioner at the time
      of her death, was a kind and gentle soul. This description of her, provided
      me by her brother and sister-in-law during their court presented victim
      impact statements, was underscored by the evidence seen and heard at trial
      and during the sentencing hearing. She was obviously very trusting and
      motherly to all who came within her sphere of influence. She had regrettably
      fallen on hard times after her husband’s death, which tragically compelled
      her to take tenants into her home.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>Her ultimate demise, as is evident from the photographs of the scene
      of her murder and as was described to me by the pathologist, Dr. Toby Rose,
      was, to say the least, horrific. She sustained no fewer than 107 sharp-force
      wounds to her head, face, torso and arms, and legs, the most medically
      significant of which were to her chest, and back, which caused damage to
      her lungs, diaphragm and liver. In addition, and as if the knife wounds
      would not have been sufficient to lead to her death, she sustained a blunt
      force injury to her head, which caused bruising to the area of her brain.
      Finally, she sustained multiple defensive-type wounds to her hands and
      arms, indicating that while she was under attack, she was futilely attempting
      to protect herself.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>I was told that a combination of some or all of the sharp and blunt
      force wounds could have caused Ms. Fleming’s death. Dr. Rose could not
      tell me how long the attack lasted, in total, but agreed in cross-examination,
      that the whole assault could have been over a brief period of time, at
      the end of which she believes that Ms. Fleming must have, mercifully, lost
      consciousness. Dr. Rose was further of the view that Ms.&nbsp;Fleming would
      have survived for a few minutes thereafter before expiring.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      respondent was drinking heavily on the day of the offence. He could not
      remember anything except finding himself early the next morning sitting
      in the victim’s bedroom beside her badly beaten and stabbed body. He initially
      believed he must have killed the victim and eventually he called the police
      and confessed to the crime. However, he later took the position, which
      he maintained at trial, that he did not kill her but merely found her dead
      in her room. Although the jury did not have a reasonable doubt about the
      respondent’s responsibility for the death, they returned a verdict not
      of murder but of manslaughter, based on the defence of intoxication.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      respondent had no criminal record. However, the Crown initially took the
      position that he should be found to be a dangerous offender. The trial
      judge issued an order under s. 752.1 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>requiring
      the respondent to undergo a psychiatric assessment. When this assessment
      did not support the dangerous offender application, Crown counsel brought
      a long-term offender application and asked the trial judge to order additional
      s. 752.1 assessments.  The trial judge refused these requests, concluding
      that the evidence was insufficient for there to be a reasonable possibility
      of success on the long-term offender application. Although there was some
      evidence suggesting that the respondent had a history of behaving violently
      toward one of his former spouses while intoxicated, the evidence was not
      sufficiently cogent for the Court to make any of the necessary findings
      beyond a reasonable doubt. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
      the sentencing hearing, the Crown took the position that the appropriate
      sentence was life imprisonment. The defence submission was 7 to 10 years.
      There was also an issue of the credit to be given for the 2 years and 8
      months the respondent had spent in pre-trial custody because the conditions
      had been particularly onerous during the SARS crisis in Toronto. The trial
      judge imposed a sentence of 11 years before deducting 6.5 years for time
      served, leaving a net sentence of 4.5 years.</span></p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Crown seeks leave to appeal the respondent’s sentence on two grounds.  First,
      the Crown submits that the sentence imposed by the trial judge is so low
      as to be manifestly unfit. Second, the Crown argues that, as a result of
      the trial judge’s misunderstanding of the trial Crown’s position on sentence
      and incorrect categorization of the offence as one of “aggravated manslaughter”,
      he wrongly limited the available range of sentence to 8 to 12 years. As
      a result of this error, he failed to give sufficient weight to the horrific
      nature of the crime.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Crown says that the trial judge erred by treating this Court’s decision
      in <i>R. v. Clarke</i>, [2003] O.J. No. 1966<i> </i>as setting an immutable
      range of sentence that must be applied when the circumstances characterize
      the crime as
    “aggravated manslaughter”, except in very rare cases where a life sentence
    is justified. The Crown argues that in so doing, the trial judge excluded
    the intermediate range between 12 years and life imprisonment that was appropriate
    in this case because of the nature of the victim and the horror of the offence.
    Essentially, the Crown says that the blunt force head trauma and 107 stab
    wounds inflicted on a trusting, sleeping, elderly woman render the facts
    of this case more horrific than those in <i>Clarke.</i> It was incumbent
    on the trial judge to sentence based on the unique circumstances of this
    case, not to pigeon-hole the facts into a defined category.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      issues of law that are raised in this case are: (1) is it correct to use
      a label of “aggravated manslaughter” to describe a subcategory of offence
      to which a range of sentence must be applied in every case? and, (2) was
      the trial judge bound to treat 12 years as the highest sentence available
      if the facts and circumstances were viewed as similar to those in <i>Clarke</i>?
      The issue of mixed fact and law is whether the trial judge did bind himself
      and thereby err.</span></p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      role of the sentencing judge is to impose a sentence that is fit. Significant
      deference is accorded to trial judges who have the greatest familiarity
      with all the relevant circumstances in respect of the sentences they impose.
      See <i>R. v. Shropshire</i> (1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at 209-10 (S.C.C.)
      and <i>R. v. M.(C.A.) </i>(1996), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 327 at 375 (S.C.C.).
      The principle of deference recognizes that for any case, there is no one
      correct, fit sentence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Supreme Court of Canada has made it clear in cases such as <i>R. v. McDonnell</i> (1997),
      114 C.C.C. (3d) 436 at 458, <i>R. v. Stone</i> (1999), 134 C.C.C. (3d)
      353 at para. 244, and <i>R. v. Proulx</i> (2000), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 449 at
      paras. 86-89 that it is appropriate for trial judges to consider a starting
      point or range of sentence for a particular offence committed in particular
      circumstances. This approach accords with the principle that like crimes
      will attract like sentences. In many if not most cases, after considering
      all the relevant factors that affect sentence, a trial judge will impose
      a sentence that is within the developed range.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>However,
      a trial judge is entitled to deviate from that starting point or range
      after considering the particular facts of the case including the circumstances
      of the victim, the particulars of the crime, and the history and circumstances
      of the offender. Where there are facts or circumstances that distinguish
      the situation significantly from other cases where sentences were imposed
      within the range, whether because of the victim, the nature of the crime
      itself, or the history or current circumstances of the offender, the trial
      judge is entitled to impose a sentence that adequately reflects the significance
      of those facts. In <i>R. v. Cheddesingh</i> (2004), 182 C.C.C. (3d) 37
      at 38, the Supreme Court repeated: “As is always the case with sentencing,
      the inquiry must proceed on a case-by-case basis.” </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    role of an appellate court is to determine whether the sentence appealed
    from was demonstrably unfit. One factor for the reviewing court to consider
    is whether the sentence imposed was outside the “normal range”, and therefore
    was demonstrably unfit because of its inconsistency with sentences imposed
    in similar circumstances. See <i>McDonnell</i>, <i>supra</i> at 458. But
    where the trial judge has given reasons that point to specifics of the victim,
    the crime, or the offender that warrant a sentence outside the normal range,
    it is unlikely that such a sentence will be found to be demonstrably unfit
    for that reason.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sometimes
    ranges of sentence have been applied to named subcategories of offences.
    In <i>R. v. Bernier</i> (2003), 177 C.C.C. (3d) 137, the British Columbia
    Court of Appeal pointed out that one danger of this approach is that a defined
    or named subcategory can be too broadly described to be useful as a device
    for setting a range.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the trial judge and all counsel agreed that this was a case of “aggravated
    manslaughter”, as recently described by this Court in the case of <i>Clarke</i>, <i>supra</i>.  In
    that case,<i> </i>the Court agreed with counsel that the accepted range for
    aggravated manslaughter is 8 to 12 years. Although Crown counsel in the case
    at bar acquiesced in characterizing the offence as aggravated manslaughter,
    he submitted that this case called for a sentence of life in prison because
    its egregious circumstances were much worse than those in <i>Clarke</i>.
    I think it is fair to say, however, that when pressed by the trial judge,
    Crown counsel was not able to point to cases where a sentence between 12
    years and life in prison was imposed for circumstances that amounted to aggravated
    manslaughter, whatever the nomenclature. It is also fair to say that Crown
    counsel at trial was not seeking such a sentence but was asking for the maximum
    possible penalty of life imprisonment provided by s. 236 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    question for this Court is whether the trial judge circumscribed his own
    discretion, or felt bound by <i>Clarke </i>to categorize the offence as “aggravated
    manslaughter” and to impose a sentence within the range of 8 to 12 years,
    when a proper consideration of all the relevant factors would have called
    for a sentence in excess of 12 years.</p>

    consideration, as I must, the statutory principles of sentencing, as interpreted
    by the case law, having regard to all the circumstances, which include but

    trial judge then examined in detail Mr. Devaney’s background including the
    evidence that had been compiled to prepare the psychiatric report in aid
    of the dangerous offender application. Although there was some suggestion
    of a history of assaultive domestic conduct, it was equivocal. Mr. Devaney
    had no criminal record. He acknowledged his severe drinking problem, but
    while in pre-trial and pre-sentence custody, he had not had a drink.  He
    advised the Court that he was amenable to taking substance abuse and anger
    management programs in the penitentiary.</p>

    of sentencing. He noted that a sentence must be proportionate to the gravity
    of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender, and that

      trial judge then went on to compare the circumstances of this case with
      those in <i>Clarke </i>where Clarke, 29, attacked his friend Cousins, a
      47-year-old frail and emaciated alcoholic. The victim owned a rooming house
      where Clarke had a room. The attack took place in their home while the
      victim was very inebriated. The victim was brutally stabbed seven times.
      Some of the wounds were inflicted with sufficient force for the knife to
      go through the breastbone and pericardial sac, into the pulmonary artery.
      Clarke first tried to divert suspicion away from himself, then eventually
      admitted that he had caused the death. Although the evidence of his alcohol
      impairment was minimal, the jury convicted Clarke only of manslaughter,
      not murder, based either on the defence of provocation or a rolled up defence
      of lack of intent based on provocation and some consumption of alcohol.</span></p>

      not one of “aggravated manslaughter”. In an oral endorsement, the Court

      by hiding the knife and by sending the police searching for the perpetrator;

      was with a knife and another blunt force object; the attack was brutal
      and horrific; the knife was never found and there were efforts to remove
      evidence of the attack; the appellant did not attempt to get help for the

    the trial judge discussed the sentencing objectives that he concluded applied
    in this case: denunciation to express society’s revulsion for the sheer violence;
    specific deterrence to Mr. Devaney in terms of the urgent need to control
    his alcoholism and its consequences; general deterrence to those who believe
    they are less responsible because they allow themselves to get drunk, then
    lose control; and rehabilitation. On the last issue, the trial judge expressed
    some concern about Mr. Devaney’s genuine desire to deal with his dependency,
    but expressed confidence that programs offered in the penitentiary have some
    value. Based on the psychiatric evidence presented earlier, the trial judge
    rejected the need for a life sentence and the allegation that Mr. Devaney
    was at risk to re-offend. Finally, the trial judge dealt with the credit
    to be given for pre-trial custody, a matter which is not the subject of this

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown on appeal emphasizes three aspects of this crime that it says particularly
    distinguish this case from <i>Clarke</i> and call for a sentence of 18 to
    20 years. First, the brutal attack on the victim was extremely horrific and
    involved 107 stab wounds, not seven as in the <i>Clarke</i> case, as well
    as an assault on the head with a blunt object. The fact that there were twenty-five
    defensive wounds showed that the victim suffered greatly, trying to defend
    herself. One can only imagine her terror. The second aspect is the nature
    of this victim who was not only a vulnerable elderly woman, but who also,
    although she was in a financially perilous situation, was a good Samaritan
    who reached out to the respondent, allowing him to stay in her home as a
    tenant for as long as she could, even when he was unable to pay the rent.
    He referred to her as his best friend. The fact that the respondent callously
    betrayed this relationship is a serious aggravating factor. The third difference
    is that in <i>Clarke</i>, there was some evidence of provocation, which is
    a factor that can be taken into account both on conviction and on sentence.
    See <i>Stone, supra</i> at paras. 41 and 246-8.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first question is whether it is appropriate to label a subcategory of manslaughter
    as “aggravated manslaughter” for the purpose of sentencing. In my view, it
    is not useful to attach a label to a subcategory of the offence, then to
    try to pigeonhole the facts of any case into the label. Adding a descriptive
    label to a set of facts within the defined offence adds a level of complexity
    to the sentencing exercise that is both unnecessary and potentially diverting
    for the court and could lead to errors. Nor do I read this court’s decision
    in <i>Clarke </i>as adopting that approach. In that case, after considering
    all of the aggravating factors, the court concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In light of
    these aggravating factors, we agree that the proper range for this offence
    and this offender is 8 to 12 years imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    exercise in each case is to impose a sentence that fits the facts and circumstances
    of the particular case and the particular offender. Part of that exercise
    is to impose similar sentences for similar offences and offenders. However,
    I would reject the concept of naming subcategories of manslaughter for the
    purpose of comparing cases and imposing similar sentences, and instead compare
    the circumstances of each situation on a case- by- case basis. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no doubt that this case required a very significant penalty. In my view,
    the trial judge could well have concluded that this was a case that called
    for a sentence outside the range established in the <i>Clarke</i> decision,
    for the reasons suggested by the Crown. Although the attacks in both cases
    were horrendous in their violence and callousness, an attack by 107 knife
    stabs where the victim remained conscious for most of the struggle may be
    seen as more egregious than an attack of seven knife stabs that killed the
    victim more quickly. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
    a fair reading of the colloquy between the trial judge and counsel during
    the sentencing submissions suggests that the trial judge may have believed
    that if he did not consider this a case for life imprisonment, his discretion
    was circumscribed by the range of 8 to 12 years if he considered this to
    be a case of “aggravated manslaughter”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    when one reviews the thorough and comprehensive reasons for sentence of the
    trial judge, it is clear that he considered every relevant factor and that
    he imposed the sentence that he believed was fit and appropriate in all the
    circumstances of this case. He imposed a sentence of 11 years. It is telling
    that he deliberately chose a sentence that was not at the top of the <i>Clarke </i>range.
    Had he wanted to go above the range but felt constrained from doing so, it
    is likely that he would have imposed the maximum of 12 years that he believed
    he could.</p>

line-height:normal'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    conclude that the trial judge did not err in law by imposing a lower sentence
    than he otherwise would have because he believed he was constrained by the
    range of 8 to 12 years set in <i>Clarke</i> for the offence of manslaughter
    with significant aggravating circumstances. Had he done so, that would have
    amounted to an error in law. However, it is clear from his reasons that the
    trial judge imposed the sentence that he believed was appropriate for this
    offender and this offence in all the circumstances. He did not impose a sentence
    that was manifestly unfit, and his decision is therefore entitled to deference.</p>
