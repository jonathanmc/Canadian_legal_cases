    trial judge noted that to conclude that the tort of deceit has been established,
    a court must find that each of the following five constituent elements has
    been proven:  </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:
normal'>(1) The defendant has made a false representation or statement;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:

  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:

  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:

  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the appellants lied to 3Com about the identity and
    location of Zorin’s customers in order to induce 3Com to give Zorin special,
    discounted pricing on 3Com switches and other computer networking products.  Specifically,
    the appellants falsely told 3Com that the 3Com products were destined for
    ministries of education in China and Australia as end-users.  Relying on
    the appellants’
    misrepresentations, 3Com approved the transactions for Meet Comp discounted
    prices.  3Com then paid rebates in the aggregate amount of US$6,499,899.19
    to Tech Data, the distributor from whom Zorin purchased the 3Com products.  However,
    instead of delivering the computer products to ministries of education in
    China and Australia, Zorin sold them to companies called Gamma Global and
    Computer Service Point, both of which trade in computer equipment.  A significant
    portion of the products ended up in the market outside regular distribution
    channels, that is,
    “the grey market”.  The trial judge found that, but for the appellants’ misrepresentations,
    3Com would not have given the rebates to its Canadian distributor Tech Data
    and awarded the amount of the rebates (US$6,499,899.19) plus interest to
    3Com as damages.  He rejected the third party action against Tech Data.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the reasons for judgment of the trial judge disclose
    that he made errors in processing the evidence because he failed to appreciate
    relevant evidence and either disregarded or misapprehended much of the evidence.  The
    evidence respecting which the appellants say the trial judge made processing
    errors is as follows:  (i)&nbsp;Zorin did not make a false representation
    but only a forecast as to future sales;  (ii)&nbsp;the appellants Sicilia
    and Marotta had no knowledge that what they said was false;  (iii)&nbsp;3Com
    was not materially induced to approve the Meet Comp discounts by what was
    said because it conducted its own investigation which showed that the products
    were not being shipped to China; and, (iv)&nbsp;3Com acted to accommodate
    its Canadian subsidiary, 3Com Canada, and its distributor, Tech Data, so
    that they could make their third quarter numbers, and consequently the cause
    of any diminution in profit was these internal corporate relationships.  In
    oral argument before us, the appellants asked this court alternatively to
    dismiss 3Com’s action, to reduce the damages or to order a new trial with
    respect to the liability of Zorin and Marotta and to dismiss the action as
    against Sicilia. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Overview of My Response to
      the Appellants’ Position</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would hold that the trial judge’s reasons do not
    disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence or committed any other
    processing errors. Irrespective of any sales forecast, the trial judge did
    not err in holding that:  (i)&nbsp;Zorin made a false representation as to
    where and to whom it intended to ship the 3Com computer parts it was buying
    from Tech Data, namely to ministries of education in China and Australia;  (ii)&nbsp;both
    Sicilia and Marotta knew the representation was false; and (iii)&nbsp;although
    3Com’s investigation caused it to be concerned that the parts were not being
    shipped to China as represented, based on the appellants’
    further representations, 3Com decided to continue shipping to them.  I would
    hold also that it was open to the trial judge to find that 3Com was entitled
    to the amount of the rebates it paid to Tech Data as damages.  Consequently,
    I would dismiss this appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Standard of Review</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Legal
      errors are subject to review on a standard of correctness whereas findings
      of fact are subject to review on the basis of palpable and overriding error.
      A third, or middle, category is that of a question of mixed fact and law
      and the standard of review in this third category will lie along a spectrum.
      If, for example, the appellant alleges that the error is due to the judge’s
      failure to consider a required element of a legal test, the error will
      be characterized as an error of law and be subject to a standard of correctness.
      Where, however, the issue on appeal is the judge’s interpretation of the
      evidence as a whole, the general rule is that the judge’s interpretation
      should be reviewed on the basis of palpable and overriding error: <i>Housen
      v. Nikolaisen, </i>[2002] 2 S.C.R. 235; <i>Jaegli Enterprises Ltd. v. Taylor</i>,<i> </i>[1981]
      2 S.C.R. 2;<i> Amertek Inc. v. Canadian Commercial Corp.</i> (2005), 76
      O.R. (3d) 241<i> </i>at paras. 67-68 (C.A.).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge’s conclusion, that the elements of the tort of deceit had been
      proven, is based on his findings as to whether there were false representations
      and, if so, whether 3Com relied on them and involves a question of mixed
      fact and law.  In relation to liability, the appellants do not allege that
      the trial judge misstated the law. Rather, their submissions concern the
      trial judge’s interpretation of the evidence as a whole.  In such circumstances,
      the trial judge’s conclusions should be upheld unless they constitute a
      palpable and overriding error, or are clearly wrong, unreasonable or unsupported
      by the evidence: <i>Amertek, supra</i>; <i>H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General)</i>,
      [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401<i> </i>at paras. 55-56. In addition, however, the appellants
      raise questions of law related to the trial judge’s application of the
      law and the adequacy of the reasons. The appellants’ argument in relation
      to damages is also one of mixed fact and law and involves not only the
      trial judge’s interpretation of the evidence but also the conceptual basis
      for awarding damages. Thus, aspects of that argument are subject to the
      standard of palpable and overriding error while other aspects are subject
      to a standard of correctness.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      palpable error is one that is obvious, plain to see or clear.  An error
      is overriding when it discredits the result: see <i>Housen, supra</i> at
      para. 5; <i>H.L.</i>, <i>supra </i>at para. 69.  The palpable and overriding
      standard applies to all factual findings whether based on credibility assessments,
      the weighing of competing evidence, expert evidence, the interpretation
      of documents or the drawing of inferences from primary facts.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant alleges that the trial judge made certain
    “processing errors”. The term “processing errors” comes from this court’s
    decision in <i>Keljanovic Estate v. Sanseverino</i> (2000), 186 D.L.R. (4th)
    481 at 489-90, wherein O’Connor J.A., for the majority, said: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The second kind of error that may warrant appellate
    interference is what might be called a
    “processing error”, that is an error in processing the evidence that leads
    to a finding of fact.  This type of error arises when a trial judge fails
    to appreciate the evidence relevant to a factual issue, either by disregarding
    or misapprehending that evidence.  When the appellate court finds such an
    error it must first determine the effect of that error on the trial judge’s
    reasoning.  It may interfere with the trial judge’s finding if it concludes
    that the part of the trial judge’s reasoning process that was tainted by
    the error was essential to the challenged finding of fact.</p>

    trial judge then reviewed the evidence that on December 9, 1999, representatives
    of Zorin invited representatives of 3Com to a meeting to acquaint them with
    The Learningstation concept.  The primary aspect of the meeting was a presentation
    by Jim&nbsp;Pennington, co-founder and then employee of The Learningstation.com.  Pennington
    had attended a conference in Banff the day prior.  At that conference, he
    had collected business cards from a number of the representatives of the
    Ministry of Education in China as well as from Ministry representatives from
    Australia.  The trial judge found that Pennington showed these cards to the

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    current matters and requirements for equipment.  Indeed, the phrase “are
    as follows” found in each of the phases is inconsistent [with] a forecast,
    and the only reasonable meaning is that Learningstation.com had sold the
    stated number of subscriptions to the institutions listed.   </p>

    trial judge referred to the fact that Marotta and Sicilia denied authoring
    the last page of the December&nbsp;15,&nbsp;1999, document and that Redwood
    did not recollect authoring it.  He also noted that in closing submissions,
    counsel for the appellants suggested that an employee of 3Com Canada forged
    the last page to ensure that the transaction was approved by 3Com.  The trial
    judge found as a fact that Zorin sent the disputed page to 3Com as well as
    the other pages in the e-mail.  He found Marotta’s credibility to be “exceedingly
    weak” and rejected his claim that the original document did not include the
    last page.  The trial judge also noted that on his examination for discovery,
    Marotta confirmed that the last page of this document contained information
    that he knew was going to 3Com and that the appellants had not suggested
    to 3Com’s representatives during cross&#8209;examination that the last page
    was not part of the document received from Zorin. </p>

    second group of documents on which the trial judge relied contained two e-mails
    from Marotta at Zorin to Patrick&nbsp;Kewin (“Kewin”) of 3Com dated December
    21, 1999.  In the first e-mail, Marotta stated, “This is to confirm that
    the 3Com product purchased for the Learningstation will be sent to the Ministry
    of Education for the People’s Republic of China.  Our contact is Mr. Lu Fu
    Yuan, he is located at 37 Damucang, Xidan, Beijing, China.”  In the second
    e-mail, Marotta stated, “Learningstation.com is an ASP (Application Service
    Provider) for the Ministry of Education located in Beijing, China.  We will
    be shipping to the below address that we are providing to you.”  The name
    of a contact person and delivery address was included thereafter.  After
    quoting from both of these e-mails, the trial judge found that they clearly
    indicated the end-user and destination of the specially discounted 3Com products.</p>

    fourth group of documents contained the commercial invoices.  Scattolon of
    3Com Canada testified that he met Marotta on January 10 or 11, 2000, and
    received two invoices purportedly proving delivery of 3Com products to the
    Ministry of Education in China.  The appellants disputed having created these
    fictitious documents and their counsel suggested that employees of 3Com Canada
    might have created them in order to gain 3Com’s approval of the transaction.  However,
    the trial judge rejected this suggestion and found that the appellants created
    these invoices and that Marotta indeed provided them to Scattolon on January&nbsp;10&nbsp;or
    11,&nbsp;2000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fifth document, called the Kamden Invoice, was an invoice from Kamden International
    Shipping (Canada) Inc. given to 3Com, which purported to show that the 3Com
    products purchased by Zorin from Tech Data on January&nbsp;7,&nbsp;2000 had
    been shipped to Hong Kong.  The source for the invoice was not disclosed.  Although
    Marotta, Sicilia and Redwood each denied supplying 3Com with this acknowledgely
    forged document, the trial judge found that it originated with Zorin and
    that “it [constituted] another representation from Zorin to 3Com that the
    products it purchased from Tech Data were delivered to China.”  He made this
    finding on the basis (i)&nbsp;that Marotta testified that a similar invoice
    was the genuine Kamden invoice,  (ii)&nbsp;that 3Com employees would not
    know which shipping company Zorin used or that Zorin as opposed to Learningstation
    Canada was the shipper so they could not have forged the document,  (iii)&nbsp;that
    the forged invoice had the same reference number as the genuine document
    and the only people privy to this information were Zorin employees, and (iv)&nbsp;that
    Marotta acknowledged during his examination for discovery that Zorin would
    have provided 3Com with a shipping waybill that indicated that the products
    were going to China. </p>

    3Com products to companies called Gamma Global and Computer Services Point.  3Com
    decided to purchase large amounts of its product on the grey market.  The

      the evidence of Marotta and Sicilia.  He commented that these two individuals: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[D]id not provide any testimony
      or other evidence that Learningstation Canada did any business whatsoever
      in China or Australia.  They admitted that Learningstation Canada was not
      the actual purchaser of the equipment.  Mr. Sicilia testified that Zorin
      provided Tech Data with purchase orders from Learningstation simply so
      that Tech Data could fulfill its obligation to provide end-user documentation
      to 3Com.  Learningstation Canada had no business reason to issue the purchase
      orders and it had no interest in the transaction. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN-US>. . . </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[43] The response of Mr. Marotta
      and Mr. Sicilia to this damaging and clear evidence reveals a most desperate
      attempt at justification.  Their counsel confronted 3Com witnesses with
      the possibility that parts of Zorin’s shipments were stolen in transit
      and that the stolen items ended up on the gray market.  However, no evidence
      of any theft of a Zorin shipment was introduced at trial.  </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[44] Both Mr. Marotta and Mr.
      Sicilia testified that the 3Com products purchased by Zorin might well
      be located in China and Australia.  In addition, Messrs. Marotta and Sicilia
      claimed that Gamma Global and Computer Service Point [the companies to
      which they sold the products obtained from 3Com] were partners of Learningstation.com,
      and had the rights to provide the hardware for its needs in China and Australia.  They
      produced no evidence of such partnering agreements.  Messrs. Marotta and
      Sicilia admitted in cross-examination they had no expectations as to where
      and to whom Gamma Global and Computer Service Point would resell the equipment. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[45] Given the extent and cogency

    of Zorin and Learningstation Canada because they were involved in all important
    facets of each company’s business dealings.  As they controlled and carried
    out the acts of these companies in these transactions, the trial judge held
    that both Marotta and Sicilia knew that the representations made to 3Com

    transactions for the Meet Comp discounted prices.  He rejected the appellants’

    the transactions under the Meet Comp policy.  The trial judge therefore held

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Did the trial judge ignore
      the oral evidence as a whole?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellants would have us read the trial judge’s comment that he found it
    “unnecessary to refer to the many oral representations made in this case” as
    if the trial judge said he was going to ignore the oral <i>evidence</i> presented
    over much of the thirteen-day trial.  I would reject the appellants’ submission
    for three reasons.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
      that is not what the trial judge said.  The trial judge said he did not
      need to address the oral <i>representations.</i>  What the trial judge
      was saying in the portion of his reasons reproduced at paragraphs 16 and
      17 above was that he did not need to sort through the conflicting evidence
      as to whether false oral representations were made or not because the written
      documents made it clear the appellants had made false written representations.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
      the trial judge did not ignore the oral evidence in his reasons.  The trial
      judge stated that some explanation as to the role of The Learningstation.com
      was needed to properly understand the import of the written representations.  That
      explanation was derived from the oral evidence of Kirchner, the president
      of The Learningstation.com, Pennington, one of its founders, and the evidence
      of Marotta and Sicilia concerning the Canadian company with the same name
      (Learningstation Canada).  The trial judge also referred to the oral evidence
      concerning the December 9, 1999, meeting between Zorin and representatives
      of 3Com, at which they learned about The Learningstation.com’s business
      model and international opportunities.  Further, references to the oral
      evidence were interspersed throughout the trial judge’s reasons wherein, <i>inter
      alia</i>, he  (i)&nbsp;rejected characterizing the December&nbsp;15,&nbsp;1999,
      e-mail as a forecast as opposed to a statement of committed sales;  (ii)&nbsp;commented
      that none of the witnesses for 3Com was confronted with the suggestion
      that the last page of the December 15, 1999, e-mail was not part of the
      document sent by Zorin;  (iii)&nbsp;rejected the denials of Marotta, Sicilia
      and Redwood that they created fictitious invoices for 3Com purporting to
      show delivery of computer products to the Ministry of Education in China;  (iv)&nbsp;rejected
      the denials of Marotta, Sicilia and Redwood that Zorin supplied 3Com with
      the acknowledgedly forged Kamden shipping invoice;  (v)&nbsp;rejected the
      suggestion raised in cross-examination of 3Com’s witnesses that parts of
      Zorin’s shipments of computer products were stolen in transit; and (vi)&nbsp;drew
      an adverse inference from the appellants’ failure to call witnesses from
      the companies to whom they had actually resold the equipment.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third,
      in this court’s recent decision in <i>Enbridge Gas Distribution Inc. v.
      Ontario (Energy Board)</i>, [2006] O.J. No. 1355 at para. 22, Doherty&nbsp;J.A.
      wrote that “the requirement that the reviewing court read reasons as a
      whole dictates that, where different parts of the same reasons can reasonably
      be read so as to maintain consistency within the reasons, that reading
      must be preferred over one which sends the reasons careening off in different
      directions and creates an error in law.”  In my view, the interpretation
      of the trial judge’s impugned comment put forward by the appellants is
      not consistent with the balance of the judgment and therefore ought to
      be rejected. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Did the trial judge restrict
      himself to the December 15, 1999, e-mail in finding that the appellants
      made a false misrepresentation and did he mischaracterize that e-mail?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A
      related submission is that the trial judge restricted himself to the December&nbsp;15,&nbsp;1999,
      e-mail to conclude that the appellants made an actionable representation
      and that it was false.  I disagree.  My review of the trial judge’s reasons
      indicates that before he concluded that the appellants had made a false,
      actionable misrepresentation to 3Com that the products Zorin purchased
      were being sent to ministries of education in China and Australia as end&#8209;users,
      he reviewed five documents or groups of documents as well as aspects of
      the oral evidence.  Accordingly, I would give no effect to this submission. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Did the trial judge err in
      law in rejecting the evidence that the December&nbsp;15,&nbsp;1999, e-mail
      was a forecast? </span></h4>

      appellants allege that the trial judge erred in law because he interpreted
      through his own eyes the representation he found in the document e-mailed
      by Redwood at Zorin to Scattolon at 3Com Canada on December&nbsp;15,&nbsp;1999.  The
      appellants submit that the trial judge’s characterization of this document
      as a statement of committed sales rather than a forecast is inconsistent
      with the evidence of the author and of the recipient of the document and,
      as such, was an error of law.  To establish liability in deceit, the person
      making the representation must intend that the person to whom the representation
      has been made understands the representation in the sense in which it was
      false.  Where a representation is ambiguous, the person to whom it was
      made must do more than show that in its ordinary meaning the representation
      was false:  <i>Goose v. Wilson Sandford &amp; Co. (A Firm), </i>[2000]
      E.W.J. No. 1299 at para. 41 (C.A. (Civ. Div.)).  The question is not whether
      the representor honestly believed the representation to be true in the
      sense assigned to it by the court on an objective consideration of its
      truth or falsity; rather, the question is whether the representor honestly
      believed the representation to be true in the sense in which he or she
      understood, it albeit erroneously, when it was made: <i>Akerhielm v. De
      Mare</i>,<i> </i>[1959] A.C. 789 at 805.  The meaning placed on the representation
      by the person making it, cannot, however, be so far removed from the sense
      in which it would be understood by a reasonable person that it would be
      impossible to hold that the representor honestly understood the representation
      to bear the meaning claimed by him or her and honestly believed it in that
      sense to be true.</span></p>

      who sent the December 15, 1999, e-mail, and Scattolon, the 3Com recipient,
      characterized the e-mail as a forecast of future sales.  The appellants
      submit, therefore, that the trial judge was not entitled to find that the
      e-mail contained a representation that Zorin knew was false, namely, that
      Zorin had given 3Com’s distributor, Tech Data, a purchase order for $50,000,000.00

      respondents submit that, read as a whole, the December&nbsp;15,&nbsp;1999,
      e-mail is much more than a vague forecast.  It constitutes a factual representation

      equipment in China, the United Kingdom and Australia.  It contains detailed
      information about the number of subscriptions and product required, and
      where the product is to be installed.</span></p>

      the figures for the total quantity of sales in the December 15, 1999, e-mail
      were arguably intended by the appellants to be a forecast, the email contains
      an unambiguous representation that there were educational end-users in
      China and Australia for the products being purchased from 3Com and it would
      be impossible to hold that the appellants believed this aspect of the representation
      to be true. Redwood, a Zorin employee and one of the representors, acknowledged
      in cross-examination at trial that he knew the identity of the end-user
      was important to 3Com, as did Zorin’s principals Marotta and Sicilia.  They
      were also aware that end-user verification was relevant to the discount.  The
      two follow-up e-mails sent by Marotta to Kewin at 3Com on December&nbsp;21,
      1999, continue and confirm the deliberate nature of the appellants’ deception. </span></p>

      the trial judge does not specifically refer to the evidence described above

      Canada that on January 10 or 11, 2000, Marotta gave him two commercial
      invoices purportedly proving delivery of the 3Com products to the Ministry
      of Education in China. In addition, the trial judge noted that 3Com was
      given an invoice from Kamden International Shipping (Canada) Inc. that
      purported to show that the 3Com products purchased by Zorin from Tech Data
      on January 7, 2000, had been shipped to Hong Kong.  The document was agreed
      by all to be a forgery and the trial judge rejected the suggestion made
      in argument that it could have come from anyone other than Zorin.  The
      trial judge found that the forged invoice “constitutes another representation
      from Zorin to 3Com that the products it purchased from Tech Data were delivered
      to China.”  </span></p>

      would appear then that the trial judge concluded that the appellants allayed
      3Com’s suspicions by providing further false information and assurances
      in the form of the two commercial invoices and the Kamden invoice.  The
      appellants, however, submit that the two commercial invoices were not accepted
      by 3Com as proof that the equipment had been shipped to China in view of
      an internal 3Com e-mail noting that copies of the international airway
      bills or airway bill numbers listing the carrier were missing.  The trial
      judge did not make reference to this e-mail in his reasons.  The trial
      judge also did not refer to the evidence of Jennifer Viola (“Viola”), the
      office manager for Zorin, who testified that the writing on one of the
      documents was not hers, nor did he refer to the inconsistencies between
      the two documents themselves, both of which arrived at the same value,
      but with different numbers for skids and pieces, thus indicating that at
      least one was false.  To summarize, the appellants say that the trial judge
      ignored the evidence of a number of prior invoices provided by Zorin to
      Tech Data and 3Com, which were all in the same form, signed by Viola, and
      used the business name of Zorin.  The appellants further submit that the
      trial judge engaged in impermissible speculation when he stated that “[e]mployees
      of 3Com Canada would have no knowledge of the form of commercial invoice
      used by Zorin, and no knowledge of which Zorin employee usually signs such
      invoices and the appearance of her signature.”  </span></p>

      acknowledged during his examination for discovery that Zorin would have
      provided 3Com with a shipping waybill that indicated that the products
      were going to China. The persons who would receive the greatest benefit
      from the provision of a false invoice were the appellants. Having regard
      to the evidence as a whole, the trial judge did not commit a palpable and
      overriding error in drawing the inference he did, namely,<i> </i>that the
      commercial invoices and the Kamden invoice originated from Zorin. The trial
      judge was also entitled to draw the inference that 3Com relied on this
      additional information concerning the end-user to make the Australian shipment.  Internal
      e-mails exchanged on February 4, 2000, indicate that, in the face of uncertainty
      as to whether the product was shipped to China, 3Com decided to rely on
      the appellants’ representations because it had little evidence that the
      deal was not genuine.  The trial judge’s finding respecting the commercial
      and Kamden invoices must be viewed in the context of his other conclusions
      that I have upheld, namely, his rejection of the appellants’ submission
      that 3Com was required to exercise greater diligence in discovering the
      deceit,<i> </i>and his rejection of the appellants’ position that 3Com
      should have known the transaction was fraudulent.  Viewed in context, it
      is apparent that the trial judge did not overlook the evidence he did not
      mention, but implicitly rejected it. </span></p>

      and that they intended for 3Com to rely on their false representations.  He

    the appellants’ submissions amount to an argument that the trial judge erred

    the appellants were advancing. A difference of opinion with the trial judge
    is not sufficient to show palpable and overriding error: <i>Schwartz v. Canada</i>,<i> </i>[1996]
    1 S.C.R. 254 at paras. 32-33; <i>H.L.</i>, <i>supra</i> at para. 74.  To
    the extent that the appellants’ submissions raise the issue of what constitutes
    sufficient reasons from a trial judge, the reasons are sufficiently amenable
    to appellate review as required by <i>R. v. Sheppard</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R.
    869 and <i>R. v. Braich</i>,<i> </i>[2002] 1 S.C.R. 903.  While more comprehensive
    reasons could, perhaps, have been given in certain areas, the trial judge’s
    reasons demonstrate the rationale behind his conclusions on credibility and
    the bases for his other conclusions. The functional requirements of reasons,
    namely, to justify the result and to inform the losing parties why they lost
    are fulfilled.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Did the trial judge err in
      finding that the appellants’ actions caused the loss claimed by 3Com?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the trial judge erred in finding that the appellants’ actions
    caused the loss claimed by 3Com for essentially three reasons. First, they
    say that there was no evidence that 3Com sustained any loss on any computer
    equipment sold and delivered by Tech Data to Zorin and, in tort, only losses
    are to be compensated. Second, they say that there was no evidence to demonstrate
    that the equipment provided by Tech Data to Zorin would have sold for any
    other higher price. Third, they say that <span lang=EN-US>3Com granted the
    SPQ to Tech Data in April&nbsp;2000 and back&#8209;dated it to February&nbsp;2000
    in order to accommodate its subsidiary, 3Com Canada, and indirectly its distributor,
    Tech Data.  Accordingly, any diminution in profit was due to internal corporate
    relationships.  Furthermore, because Tech Data agreed to sell its goods to
    Zorin at an agreed upon price with no restrictions as to end&#8209;user identity
    or location written into the contract, the appellants submit that there was
    no obligation on 3Com to retroactively grant the SPQ to Tech Data and pay
    the rebates. These three arguments appear to be essentially the same arguments
    advanced at trial that the trial judge rejected.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the trial judge’s rejection of the appellants’
    arguments. The appellants’ first argument on damages overlooks the fact that,
    in tort law, “the plaintiff is to be put in the position it would have been
    in had the misrepresentation not been made”: see <i>BG Checo International
    Ltd. v. British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 12
    at 37. Although not written into the contracts, a vital condition to their
    formation was that the appellants deliver the goods to the persons to whom,
    and the places where, they said they were shipping the goods.  The appellants
    were aware that the purchase price was based on the information they provided
    as to educational end-user and place. The fact that we are dealing here with
    a diminution in profit rather than an actual loss matters not. If the appellants
    had provided the respondents with the true customers and places of shipment,
    the respondents would have been entitled to a higher price for their goods
    or to refuse to sell their goods at the prices they did. The appellants deprived
    the respondents of this choice and made a greater profit because they did
    so. It was not necessary, in the circumstances of this case, to introduce
    evidence of a specific alternative third party buyer. In essence, the appellants’ first
    and second arguments amount to a submission that the difference between the
    SPQ and what 3Com’s pricing would have been should remain with the appellants.  The
    appellants’ submission ignores the conceptual basis of tort law, which is
    restitutionary.  The difference between the contract price and the price
    at which the appellants would otherwise have had to purchase the goods is
    a cost properly borne by the appellants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants’ third argument is that 3Com did not have to pay the rebates it
    did to Tech Data because it had discovered the appellants’
    deceitful conduct before it paid the rebates. Thus, the appellants submit
    that they should not be responsible for 3Com’s diminution of profit due to
    the rebates paid to Tech Data. It appears from the evidence that <span lang=EN-US>3Com
    approved and paid rebates on <i>two</i> SPQs, one for China and one for Australia. </span>On
    the facts as found by the trial judge, the appellants’
    argument only applies to the SPQ and rebate for the Australia shipment.<span
lang=EN-US>  With regard to the China shipment, the trial judge found that prior
    to knowing the appellants had deceived them, </span>3Com suffered damage
    in that it paid rebates to Tech Data. These rebates “were actual out of pocket
    losses”, a natural consequence of the appellants’ deceit, and, again, the
    respondent is entitled to be restored to the position it would have been
    in but for that deceit.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In
      relation to the second SPQ, <i>i.e. </i>the one for the Australia shipment,
      the appellants are in essence saying that the respondents did not mitigate
      their losses.  As is well known, a plaintiff must take all <i>reasonable</i> steps
      to mitigate its loss and cannot claim any damages due to its neglect to
      take such steps: see <i>e.g.</i> <i>British Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing
      Company, Ltd. v. Underground Electric Railways Company of London, Ltd.</i>,<i> </i>[1912]
      A.C. 673 at 689 (H.L.).</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>On
      the findings made by the trial judge, it appears that, at the time 3Com
      assured Tech Data it would pay them a rebate and asked them to ship the
      product, 3Com would not have known the appellants had deceived them. After
      shipping the goods, but prior to paying the rebate, 3Com had proof of the
      appellants’
    deception. The Australian SPQ appears to have been back&#8209;dated and paid
    so as to honour the assurances made by 3Com to Tech Data because 3Com felt
    legally and morally obliged to pay the rebate.  Legally, 3Com was concerned
    that Tech Data would begin a lawsuit to enforce 3Com’s promise to pay the
    rebate. Morally, 3Com did not want to take advantage of Tech Data and suffer
    the probability that an important commercial relationship with its distributor
    would be ruptured.   The trial judge was of the opinion that 3Com acted reasonably
    in paying the rebates under apprehension of legal action and I would agree
    with him.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>3Com
      was not obliged to risk losing an important commercial relationship. In
      his text, <i>The Law of Damages</i>, Professor Waddams states that “in
      judging the reasonableness of the plaintiff’s conduct [with respect to
      avoiding or mitigating loss] a long view can be taken, and the plaintiff
      will not be bound to take a short&#8209;term gain at the cost of jeopardizing
      a long-term interest”: see S. M. Waddams, <i>The Law of Damages</i>, looseleaf
      (Toronto: Canada Law Book, 1991) at 15&#8209;9.  This principle is reflected
      in the decision of the English Court of Appeal in <i>James Finlay &amp; Co.,
      Ltd. v. N. V. Kwik Hoo Tong Handel Maatschappij</i>, [1928] All E.R. Rep.
      110 (C.A.).  In that case, the defendant sellers agreed to send a quantity
      of Java sugar in each of July, August and September to Bombay. As was their
      custom, the plaintiffs entered into sub-contracts with buyers in Bombay.
      The agreements provided that the shipping documents were conclusive proof
      of the date of shipment.  The defendants duly delivered the July and August
      shipments but, although the shipping documents indicated the sugar for
      September was shipped on the last day of September, it was in fact shipped
      on October 2<sup>nd</sup>. By the time the shipment arrived in Bombay the
      price of sugar had fallen.  The plaintiffs chose not to enforce the strict
      terms of the contracts between themselves and their subcontractors but
      sued the defendants for the difference in price.  The defendants pleaded
      that the plaintiffs had failed to mitigate their loss and that they should
      not be responsible. The court held that no plaintiff is obliged to take
      steps to minimize damages if by so doing the plaintiff would jeopardize
      its commercial reputation. In particular, Greer L.J. stated at p. 117 that
    “[p]eople have not got to consider merely what is right in a strict court
    of conscience, but they have got to consider what is the effect of their
    conduct upon their business relationships with other people, and I can have
    very little doubt that it would not have suited their business to have taken
    the extreme course which is suggested”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    in <i>Banco de Portugal v. Waterlow &amp; Sons, Ltd.</i>, [1932] A.C. 452
    (H.L.), the defendant was a printer of bank notes for the plaintiff bank,
    which held an exclusive licence from the government of Portugal to issue
    bank notes as legal tender in that country. The defendant, in breach of contract,
    printed a quantity of these bank notes from the same plates or from plates
    made from the same dies as had been used to fulfil the plaintiff bank’s contract
    and delivered them to unauthorised persons. These persons put the forged
    bank notes into circulation. On discovering this fraud, the plaintiff bank
    cancelled the entire issue and exchanged bank notes of that issue then in
    circulation for authorized bank notes of equivalent value. Accordingly, many
    thousands of bank notes – both legitimate and forged – were exchanged for
    new, genuine bank notes. Even though the plaintiff bank was under no obligation
    to pay the forged bank notes, the House of Lords held that it had nonetheless
    acted reasonably, for if it had not exchanged new bank notes for <i>all</i> the
    notes from the issue (both legitimate and forged), it would have created
    an economic panic and caused grave damage to the credit of the bank. The
    following statement from Lord Macmillan is of particular relevance to the
    case at bar, despite the fact that it deals with a breach of contract rather
    than a tort:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where the sufferer from a breach of contract finds
    himself in consequence of that breach placed in a position of embarrassment
    the measures which he may be driven to adopt in order to extricate himself
    ought not to be weighed in nice scales at the instance of the party whose
    breach of contract has occasioned the difficulty. It is often easier after
    an emergency has passed to criticize the steps which have been taken to meet
    it, but such criticism does not come well from those who have themselves
    created the emergency. The law is satisfied if the party placed in a difficult
    situation by reason of the breach of a duty owed to him has acted reasonably
    in adoption of remedial measures, and he will not be held disentitled to
    recover the cost of such measures merely because the party in breach can
    suggest that other measures less burdensome to him might have been taken
    (p. 506).</p>
