 part of the appellant's body was shown in the photographs, unlike Ms. J.,
 neither his face nor any other identifying characteristics were apparent.&nbsp;

 heard of things like a desire to make the victim hurt like he felt he was

 judge to assume at the time of the plea that the appellant admitted the facts

 collage to be child pornography and that he did not consider himself to be a
 child pornographer does not detract from his admission of guilt.&nbsp;He recognized
 that he had committed a breach of the <i>Criminal Code</i> but simply disagreed
 with the characterization of the offences as offences of child pornography.&nbsp;

 provided ineffective representation.&nbsp;He makes several allegations.&nbsp;Central to
 his complaint of incompetence is the allegation that his counsel failed to
 advise him that if he pleaded guilty to the offences charged, he was at risk of
 going to jail.</span></p>

 appeal, stated that between the day he retained his trial lawyer in March or
 April 2003 and the day that he pleaded guilty on January 13<sup>th</sup>, 2004
 he never spoke to his lawyer for more than five minutes at a time on four or
 five occasions at court.&nbsp;He said that he tried to arrange for a lengthier
 interview in the lawyer's office but was unable to do so.&nbsp;The appellant also
 said that his lawyer never returned his phone calls.</span></p>

 that he could receive a custodial sentence.&nbsp;He also denied that his meetings
 with the appellant were no more than five minutes.&nbsp;Unfortunately, there is
 very little documentation in the lawyer's file concerning his discussions with
 his client.&nbsp;On this issue there is very little, if anything, that is helpful.&nbsp;
 What emerges from the record is that Mr. Burgess is an extremely busy criminal
 lawyer who testified in cross-examination that he handles as many as eight to
 ten cases a day in the Peterborough court.&nbsp;He did not challenge the
 appellant's assertion that all of their meetings were at the courthouse at
 times when the charges against the appellant were before the court to be spoken
 to.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

 that trial counsel believed, and rightly so, that there was no viable defence
 to the charges of making and distributing child pornography.&nbsp;Counsel's focus
 was on his attempt to negotiate a plea bargain, which would keep the appellant
 out of jail.&nbsp;His discussions with the Crown attorney were directed towards
 either a conditional discharge or a conditional sentence.&nbsp;A conditional
 discharge was out of the question.&nbsp;He could not get the Crown to commit to any
 position on sentence until the Crown saw the presentence report. &nbsp;In the
 result, if there was to be a plea it would take place before they knew the
 Crown's position on sentence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>What appears to have happened is that both
 lawyer and client, in their discussions, were placing most of their attention on
 a conditional sentence with the result that jail was not uppermost in either
 person's mind. The lawyer's communication with his client could have been much
 better.&nbsp;Brief meetings at the court house are not the most satisfactory way to
 communicate, particularly when counsel is handling as many as eight or ten
 cases a day.&nbsp;Nevertheless, I am not persuaded that Mr. Burgess did not tell
 the appellant that there was a risk of his going to jail.&nbsp;The onus is on the
 appellant in this respect.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In a recent judgment of this court Doherty J.A.
 reviewed the legal principles relevant to establishing a claim of ineffective
 representation of counsel. &nbsp;At para. 18 of <i>R.&nbsp;v. Archer</i> (2005),
 202 C.C.C. (3d) 60 , he held:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is helpful to begin
 with a summary of the applicable legal principles, none of which are in
 dispute.&nbsp;An accused who is represented at trial is entitled to effective
 representation by counsel.&nbsp;Ineffective representation may result in a
 miscarriage of justice necessitating the quashing of the conviction on appeal.&nbsp;
 Evidence relating to the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel will be
 received on appeal pursuant to s. 683(1) so that the appellate court may
 determine whether the representation was ineffective and ultimately whether it
 resulted in a miscarriage of justice:&nbsp;<i>R. v. Joanisse</i> (1995), 102 C.C.C.
 (3d) 35 at 43-44, 56-58 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [1996]
 S.C.C.A. No. 347;&nbsp;<i>R. v. B.(L.C.)</i> (1996), 104 C.C.C. (3d) 353 (Ont.
 C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Doherty J.A.
 further stated at paras. 119-120 that three things must be shown by an
 appellant seeking to quash a conviction on the basis of ineffective assistance
 of counsel:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>First, where the claim
 is based on contested facts, the appellant must establish the material facts on
 the balance of probabilities.&nbsp;Second, the appellant must demonstrate that
 counsel's acts or omissions amounted to incompetence.&nbsp;Incompetence is measured
 against a reasonableness standard.&nbsp;That assessment is made having regard to
 the circumstances as they existed when the impugned acts or omissions
 occurred.&nbsp;Hindsight plays no role in the assessment.&nbsp;Allegations of
 incompetent representation must be closely scrutinized.&nbsp;Many decisions made by
 counsel at trial will come to be seen as erroneous in the cold light of a
 conviction.&nbsp;The reasonableness analysis must proceed upon a "strong
 presumption that counsel's conduct fell within the wide range of reasonable professional
 assistance":&nbsp;<i>R. v. G.D.B.</i> (2000), 143 C.C.C. (3d) 289 at 298 (S.C.C.).&nbsp;
 As this court said in <i>R. v. White</i> (1997), 114 C.C.C. (3d) 225 at 247:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>An appellate court's review of trial counsel's
 performance should be deferential. … deference is called for because of the
 broad spectrum of professional judgment that might be considered reasonable.&nbsp;
 In most cases, even among the most skilled counsel, no two lawyers will defend
 an accused in the same way.&nbsp;Different defence counsel will use different trial
 strategies and tactics, different approaches to the examination and
 cross-examination of witnesses, different styles in opening and closing
 argument, all of them reasonable.&nbsp;The art of advocacy yields few, if any,
 absolute rules.&nbsp;It is a highly individualized art.&nbsp;What proves effective for
 one counsel may be ineffective for another.&nbsp;Most cases, therefore, offer
 defence counsel a wide scope for the exercise of reasonable skill and
 judgment.&nbsp;Appellate judges, many of them advocates in their own practices,
 should not be too quick to conclude that a trial lawyer's performance was
 deficient because they would have conducted the defence differently.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Third, the appellant
 must demonstrate that counsel's ineffective representation caused a miscarriage
 of justice.&nbsp;A miscarriage of justice occurs if the appellate court is
 satisfied that counsel's ineffective representation undermined the appearance
 of the fairness of the trial, or the reliability of the verdict.&nbsp;A verdict is
 rendered unreliable where the appellant demonstrates that had counsel performed
 in a competent fashion, there is a reasonable possibility that the verdict
 could have been different.</p>

 referred to the observation of Major J. in <i>&nbsp;R.&nbsp;v.. G.D.B.</i> at
 298 that when an allegation of lawyer incompetence is made on appeal the court
 should first consider whether the alleged incompetence resulted in a
 miscarriage of justice.&nbsp;If the court is satisfied that there has been no
 miscarriage of justice, then it is unnecessary to assess the conduct of
 counsel.&nbsp;As Doherty J.A. aptly put it:&nbsp;"This approach recognizes that it is
 the appellate court's function to determine whether a miscarriage of justice
 has occurred and not to grade counsel's performance."</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;I am satisfied that, even if a case could be
 made out in respect of these additional allegations of incompetence, there was
 not a miscarriage of justice in this case.&nbsp;The case against the appellant was
 overwhelming.&nbsp;The appellant admitted that Ms. J. was under eighteen years of
 age and that the photos depicted explicit sexual activity.&nbsp;He admitted making
 the collage and admitted e-mailing it to his friend. </span></p>

 possible defence of artistic merit as submitted by counsel for the appellant in
 this appeal.&nbsp;Counsel suggested that the collage was a take off of a MasterCard
 commercial and argued that this gave the collage its artistic merit.&nbsp;I
 disagree.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Counsel for the appellant relied upon the
 reasons for judgment of McLachlin C.J.C. in <i>R. v. Sharpe</i> (2001), 150
 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.), in which she discussed the defence of artistic merit.
 At para. 63 she stated:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I conclude that
 "artistic merit" should be interpreted as including any expression that may
 reasonably be viewed as art.&nbsp;Any objectively established artistic value,
 however small, suffices to support the defence. Simply put, artists, so long as
 they are producing art, should not fear prosecution under s.&nbsp;163.1(4).&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view there is nothing in the collage in

 incompetence raised by the appellant.&nbsp;As I have already stated, I am satisfied
 that there was no miscarriage of justice in this case.&nbsp;Therefore, in
 accordance with the observation of Major J. in <i>R. v. G.B.D.</i>,<i> </i>I<i> </i>find it unnecessary to consider further the remaining allegations of
 incompetence.</span></p>
