      in <i>Mahalingan,</i> the sole issue at trial was identity of the perpetrators
      of the attack on Perinpanathan and Balasingam. Perinpanathan knew the appellant
      from seeing him at school and testified that he did not see the appellant
      on the night of the assault. However, Perinpanathan lost consciousness
      during the attack.</span></p>

      testified that he was acquainted with the appellant and that earlier on
      the day of the attack, he telephoned the appellant twice regarding an unrelated
      incident involving an assault on several youths known as the “Middlefield
      boys”.  Balasingam told the appellant that he had nothing to do with the
      incident but that he had been asked to help the Middlefield boys.  Balasingam
      testified that the appellant admitted to having participated in the assault
      on the Middlefield boys and told Balasingam not to get involved.  Balasingam
      said that his calls to the appellant had ended amicably, although he testified
      that the appellant had yelled at him during the second phone call.  Balasingam
      did not tell the appellant where he would be later that night.</span></p>

      gave three statements to the police after the attack.  When first interviewed,
      he did not place the appellant at the scene and identified only those who
      attacked him.  In statements to the police the next day and the day after,
      Balasingam identified the appellant as one of the participants in the attack.  He
      told the police and later testified at trial that he saw the appellant
      attack Perinpanathan with an axe.</span></p>

      appellant did not testify but called his uncle, Father Virgil, a Roman
      Catholic priest, who testified that he heard Balasingam offer not to testify
      against the appellant if he were paid a bribe.  Balasingam denied making
      such an offer. </span></p>

      appellant’s defence at trial essentially was that Balasingam was an unsavoury
      witness whose evidence was riddled with inconsistencies.  The appellant
      argued that Balasingam demonstrated confusion and uncertainty regarding
      the appellant’s role in the assault and that it was not until the preliminary
      inquiry and after the appellant refused to pay him a bribe that Balasingam
      became certain of the appellant’s involvement in the attack.</span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal;'>2. Did the trial judge err in admitting
        evidence of a conversation between the appellant and Balasingam relating
        to the Middlefield boys and by failing to instruct the jury regarding
        the limited purpose for which they could use the hearsay evidence of
        the appellant’s bad character?</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='

      trial judge admitted the conversation between the appellant and Balasingam
      relating to the Middlefield boys on the basis that it was part of the narrative
      leading up to the attack and that it was also relevant to a possible motive
      for the attack.  I see no error in this ruling as I agree that Balasingam’s
      intervention on behalf of the Middlefield boys on account of the appellant’s
      assault on them could be taken as evidence of motive for the attack. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge gave the following limiting instruction: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>The evidence of gang membership or association, has been advanced during
    this trial for the limited purpose of potentially explaining why this attack
    took place and why Mr. Perinpanathan and Mr. Balasingam were targeted.  However,
    these defendants are not on trial for gang membership or association.  They
    are on trial for the two offences alleged in the indictment.  It would be
    most unfair of you to compromise the presumption of innocence, or lessen
    the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, because of this factor.</p>

      do not accept the submission that the trial judge erred in the manner in
      which he dealt with the Middlefield boys’ evidence.  While he could have
      given a specific limiting instruction tailored to the evidence relating
      to the Middlefield boys, in the context of this trial, he was entitled
      to give a general direction as to gang activities.  I am satisfied that
      the instruction he did give was sufficient to bring home to the jury the
      use they could and could not make of this evidence.</span></p>

      trial judge warned the jury that Balasingam’s evidence should be approached
      with “extreme caution” and “with the greatest care and caution”.  He also
      succinctly listed the reasons for this warning, namely Balasingam’s lengthy
      criminal record, the allegation that he had attempted to sell his evidence
      and the inconsistencies in his various statements.  As to the instruction
      that the injuries to the victims tended to confirm Balasingam’s evidence,
      the trial judge immediately added that the injuries “in no way confirm
      the identity of any or any of the persons responsible for this attack”. </span></p>

      would not give effect to this ground of appeal.  The trial judge warned
      the jury about how it should approach Balasingam’s evidence.  This is a
      discretionary matter for the trial judge and there is no standard formula
      to be followed.  The issue is </span><span lang=EN-GB>whether the instruction
      equipped the jury to weigh the evidence of the unsavoury witness appropriately.  </span><span lang=EN-US>In

      fair reading of the charge as whole, the meaning of reasonable doubt was
      communicated to the jury and the jury could not have failed to understand
      that reasonable doubt could be based on an absence of evidence.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge did not review the details of the inconsistencies in Balasingam’s
      evidence. On the other hand, he clearly explained to the jury that a cornerstone
      of the defence theory was that Balasingam could not be believed because
      of the inconsistencies in his evidence and he reminded the jury of the
      fact that defence counsel had listed those inconsistencies in her closing
      address.  I do not agree that having adequately explained to the jury the
      appellant’s position on this issue, the trial judge was obliged to go on
      to identify in detail the specific inconsistencies upon which the appellant
      relied. </span></p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal;'>6. Did the trial judge err in failing

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
      I pointed out in <i>Mahalingan</i>, the trial judge gave a relatively brief
      and concise jury instruction.  While I found that the trial judge failed
      to present an essential aspect of the theory of Mahalingan’s defence, the
      same cannot be said of the appellant’s defence. The theory of the appellant’s
      defence was simple – Balasingam was a dangerous liar who could not be believed.  The
      trial judge outlined for the jury the appellant’s position that Balasingam
      could not be believed because of his unsavoury past, the inconsistencies
      in his evidence, and the evidence of Father Virgil relating to the bribe.</span></p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal;'>7. Did the trial judge err when he refused

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>During
      the course of submissions as to the adequacy of the charge, the trial judge
      indicated that he intended to recharge the jury on various points.  However,
      in the end, he decided not to do so.  The appellant has failed to satisfy
      me that the trial judge erred in failing to recharge the jury on any of
      these points.  Accordingly, I see no basis to intervene on the ground that
      t the trial judge’s appears to have had a change of heart following submissions. </span></p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      see no merit in this ground of appeal.  While Balasingam’s evidence was
      attacked on many fronts, it provided a basis upon which a properly instructed
      jury could reasonably convict.</span></p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal;'>9. Did the trial judge err in instructing

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      see no error in the manner in which the trial judge left the issue of gang
      rivalry vis-à-vis the appellant.  There was evidence from which the jury
      could infer that gang rivalry was a motive for the attack and I have already
      set out the trial judge’s limiting instruction as to the use that could
      properly be made of evidence of gang rivalry.</span></p>

      agree with the respondent that although no evidence was tendered at trial
      as to the probation order, the appellant effectively admitted its existence
      at the sentencing hearing and waived any right to challenge its existence
      at trial.  As defence counsel put it: “ [the appellant is] not prepared
      to plead guilty to it, but I’m not asking for another trial, another formal
      trial before a jury on the issue at any rate, and I don’t want to prolong
      these matters any more than we already have…  If Your Honour is satisfied
      beyond a reasonable doubt of his guilt, based on Mr. Balasingam’s evidence,
      you can make a finding”.  In my view, the trial judge properly interpreted
      this to mean that if he was satisfied that the appellant was at the scene
      of the attack he was entitled to convict him for breach of probation.  I
      see no merit in this ground of appeal.</span></p>
