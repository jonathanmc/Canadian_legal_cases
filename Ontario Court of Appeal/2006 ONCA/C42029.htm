    are three ways in which jurisdiction may be asserted against an out-of-province
    defendant. They are described as: 1. presence-based jurisdiction; 2. consent-based
    jurisdiction; and 3. assumed jurisdiction: <i>Muscutt v. Courcelles</i> (2002),
    60 O.R. (3d) 20 (C.A.) at para. 19; <i>Incorporated Broadcasters Ltd.</i> <i>v.
    CanWest Global Communications Corp.</i> (2003), 63 O.R. (3d) 431, at para.

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defendants, respondents to this appeal, concede that, if their attornment
    to the courts of Ontario is sufficient to constitute consent, the appeal
    must succeed. In our view, it is incontrovertible that the defendants did
    attorn to the Ontario jurisdiction and thus consented to it. Without in any
    way questioning jurisdiction, they responded to the plaintiff’s pleadings
    in Ontario; they attended for examinations for discovery in Ontario, their
    counsel appeared before a master and three Superior Court judges in Ontario,
    and they participated in almost three days of the trial of this action before
    Matlow J. who, on his own motion, raised the question of jurisdiction and
    instructed counsel to research the stay provision in s. 106 of the <i>Courts
    of Justice Act</i>. It was then, for the first time, that the defendants
    took the position that Ontario did not have jurisdiction to entertain this
    action. Matlow J. adopted that position. He rejected consent as a separate
    basis of jurisdiction and focused on assumed jurisdiction. He concluded that
    his hands were tied because, on his analysis of the eight factors appearing
    in <i>Muscutt</i>, the action had no real and substantial connection with
    Ontario and the Superior Court therefore had no jurisdiction to entertain
    it. While he undoubtedly had the authority that he purported to exercise
    under s. 106, having regard to the costs the parties had already incurred
    in this litigation, it was inappropriate for him to exercise his discretion
    in the way he did. Moreover, for the reasons set out above, his decision
    was wrong in law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is allowed, the stay of proceeding is lifted and a new trial is ordered
    before a different judge. The plaintiff is entitled to counsel fee for the
    proceedings before Matlow J. on a partial indemnity basis, which costs we
    fix in the amount of $13,000, all inclusive, and which are to be paid forthwith.
    The remaining costs of the trial sought by the plaintiff, and any costs associated
    with a future trial, are reserved to the judge presiding at that trial. The
    appellant is entitled to his costs of the appeal, on a partial indemnity
    basis, which we fix in the amount of $15,000, all inclusive, and which are
    also to be paid forthwith. The firm of Beard Winter LLP is released from
    the obligation to hold the money currently held in its trust account pursuant
    to the direction of Labrosse J.A.  </p>
