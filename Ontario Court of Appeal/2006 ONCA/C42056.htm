style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 7, 2002, three police officers attended St. Patrick’s High School
    in Sarnia and, with the assistance of a “sniffer” dog, conducted a warrantless
    and random search of the school.  The attendance of the police on that particular
    day was not at the request of school authorities.  The principal and staff
    were unaware that the police were planning to attend until they arrived in
    the school.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span

    a result of an indication from the sniffer dog, the police were directed
    to the backpack of A.M.  When they searched the backpack, they found that
    it contained a quantity of marijuana and psilocybin.  A.M. was charged with
    possession for the purpose of trafficking in respect of both drugs.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, counsel for A.M. moved to exclude the evidence of the drugs found
    in the backpack on the basis that the search by the police was unreasonable
    and therefore offended s. 8 of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  The
    trial judge, Justice G. M. Hornblower of the Ontario Youth Justice Court,
    accepted the submissions of counsel and excluded the evidence related to
    the drugs under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  In the result, A.M. was
    acquitted of the charges.  </p>

    Crown now appeals the acquittals on the basis that the trial judge erred
    in finding a breach of s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i> and in excluding the evidence
    under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  </p>

      John Bristo became the principal of St. Patrick’s High School of Sarnia
      in September 2000.  At about that time, Mr. Bristo spoke to the Youth Bureau
      of Sarnia Police Services and advised the Bureau that if the police ever
      had sniffer dogs available to bring into the school, they were welcome
      to do so.  Prior to November 7, 2002 the police took advantage of this
      standing invitation on a couple of occasions.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      Bristo was concerned about the presence of drugs in the school.  He had
      received reports of drug use in the school from time to time from parents
      and school neighbors.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      Bristo testified that the school had a zero tolerance policy for possession
      and use of drugs in the school.  The zero tolerance policy was communicated
      to both the student body and the parents.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      the morning of November 7, 2002 three police officers (two from Sarnia
      Police Services and one from the O.P.P.) arrived at the school with a sniffer
      dog.  The police advised the principal that they wanted “permission to
      go through the school”.  The principal immediately gave the requested permission.  The
      principal then informed the student body on the school’s public address
      system that the police were on the premises and that they should “remain
      in the confines to their classroom[s] until the search was conducted.”  The
      result of this announcement was that no student could leave his or her
      classroom.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      police proceeded with the search of the school premises.  Before the police
      left the premises, they asked the principal if there was any place that
      he wanted the police to go.  The principal asked them to go to the small
      gymnasium and search that area as well.  </span></p>

      Bristo testified that after the police officers arrived at the school,
      he had no involvement in carrying out the search.  There was no discussion
      as to how the search was to be conducted.  On November 7, 2002 the principal
      had no knowledge that there might be drugs in the school although he said, “It’s
      pretty safe to assume that they could be there.”  </span></p>

      principal was unaware of any particular target area on November 7, 2002.  The
      reason he directed the police to the small gymnasium is that the police
      had searched everywhere else with the exception of the gymnasium and that
      is why he directed them there.</span></p>

      the request of the principal, a teacher at the school, Mr. Blake Morrison,

      Robert McCutchen of the O.P.P. proceeded to the small gymnasium with his
      sniffer dog.  The dog was trained to detect heroin, marijuana, hashish,
      crack cocaine and cocaine.  There were no students in the small gymnasium.  However,
      there were some backpacks lying next to the wall.  The sniffer dog reacted
      to one of the backpacks by biting at the backpack.  Constable McCutchen
      handed the backpack to a Sarnia police officer and told him that he may
      be interested in what was in the backpack.</span></p>

      Michael Callander of Sarnia Police Services conducted the search of the
      backpack, which was the object of the sniffer dog’s attention.  Amongst
      the contents of the backpack he identified a plastic bag containing five
      bags of marijuana, a tin box containing five bags of marijuana, a bag containing
      approximately ten magic mushrooms (psilocybin), a bag containing a pipe,
      a lighter, rolling papers and a roach clip.  A.M.’s wallet, which contained

      Callander testified that he was unaware of the existence of any drugs in
      the school when he attended there on November 7, 2002.  He agreed that,

      to try to obtain a warrant.  </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE TRIAL JUDGMENT</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge relied upon the principles set forth in the judgment of the
      Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. M.R.M</i>, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 393.  The
      trial judge concluded that the search conducted on November 7, 2002 was
      conducted without any reasonable grounds.  He further concluded that,
    “The difficulties with reasonableness in this instance are compounded by
    the fact that this was not a search conducted by school authorities.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge found that there were two searches.  The first search was the
      search conducted with the assistance of the sniffer dog; the second search
      was the search of the backpack of A.M.  The trial judge concluded that
      neither search was reasonable.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally,
      the trial judge concluded that the search was a police search in the guise
      of a search by school authorities.  He noted that, even if it had been
      a search by school authorities, the school authorities had no right to
      conduct such a search in the absence of reasonable grounds to believe drugs
      could be found.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge excluded the evidence obtained as a result of the police search
      under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  In his consideration of the application
      of s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i> the trial judge said:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>While this case centres around
      the rights of A.M., the rights of every student in the school were violated
      that day as they were all subject to an unreasonable search.  This search
      was unreasonable from the outset.  It is completely contrary to the requirements
      of the law with respect to a search in a school setting.  To admit the
      evidence is effectively to strip A.M. and any other student in a similar
      situation of the right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure.  It
      is effectively saying that persons in the same situation as A.M. have no
      rights.  Such a finding would, to my mind, bring the administration of
      justice into disrepute notwithstanding the other factors I have alluded
      to.</span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>2.         The dog sniff was not

    for the Crown submits that the police conducted the search at the request
    of the school principal who was responsible for maintaining school discipline
    and ensuring compliance with the <i>Education Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.2
    (“the <i>Education Act</i>”) and the subsidiary policies related to the presence
    of illegal drugs in schools.  Counsel further submits that, but for the standing
    invitation of the principal, no search would have been conducted by the police.  As
    a result, the police were acting as agents of the school authorities.  However,
    the Crown concedes that, given the fact that police officers physically carried
    out the search of A.M.’s backpack, the <i>Charter</i> applies.</p>

      for the Crown, in oral argument, divided the conduct of the police into
      three stages:</span></p>

      the police into the school;</span></p>

      Crown argues that in the first two stages, the police were not engaged
      in a search for s. 8 purposes.  Section 8 of the <i>Charter </i>is engaged

      see <i>R. v. Law</i>, [2002] S.C.R. 227 at para. 15.</span></p>

      had not delivered its judgment in <i>R. v. Tessling</i>, [2004] 3 S.C.R.

      was producing and trafficking in marijuana in his residence.  The police
      flew over the accused’s house in an airplane and took pictures with a Forward
      Looking Infra-Red (“FLIR”) camera.  The camera produced pictures of heat
      emanating from the house.  An analysis of the heat patterns in the pictures
      indicated that there might have been a marijuana growing operation in the
      house.  The police obtained a search warrant, based in part on the FLIR
      evidence.  The subsequent search by police revealed a large quantity of
      marijuana and weapons in the house.  During the trial of the accused for
      the possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking and other offences,
      counsel for the accused brought a s. 8 <i>Charter</i> challenge to exclude
      the evidence from the house.  The trial judge admitted the evidence.  On
      appeal to this court, the appeal was allowed on the basis that the use
      of the FLIR camera constituted an invasion of the accused’s privacy interest.  The

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A student’s backpack is in effect a portable bedroom
    and study rolled into one.  It will contain personal items such as journals,
    photos, letters, personal hygiene items, medication, clothing and school
    records.  Backpacks are often in reality the only way for students to carry
    and use items that are personal and important to them.  These items are shielded
    from view and access.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There are no contextual factors that diminish students’ legitimate
    expectation of privacy, dignity, and autonomy in their backpacks.  Students’
    expectation of privacy in their backpacks is objectively reasonable.  Backpacks
    are not searched in the normal course of a school day, nor do students come
    to school expecting that their backpacks will be searched.  The students
    did not consent to their backpacks being searched on November 7, 2002 and

    search by the police is <i>prima facie </i>unreasonable.  The Crown, who
    seeks to justify a warrantless search, has the burden of rebutting the presumption
    of unreasonableness.  In <i>Collins</i>, the Supreme Court held at p. 278
    that “[a] search will be reasonable if it is authorized by law, if the law

    para. 50.  However, I have already said that, in my opinion, this was a warrantless
    search by the police and therefore the presumption in <i>Hunter v. Southam </i>applies.  As

      standard for school authorities is required to allow them the necessary
      latitude to carry out their responsibilities to maintain a safe and orderly

      188 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at para. 69 (Ont. C.A.): “An officer cannot exercise
      the power to detain on a hunch, even a hunch borne of intuition gained
      by experience.”  </span></p>

      Supreme Court of Canada has held that there must be a clear nexus between
      the individual to be detained and a recent or on-going criminal offence.  This
      position was articulated by Iacobucci J. for the majority of the court
      in <i>R. v. Mann</i>, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 59 at para. 34:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The case law raises several guiding principles
    governing the use of a police power to detain for investigative purposes.
    The evolution of the <i>Waterfield </i>test, along with the <i>Simpson</i> articulable
    cause requirement, calls for investigative detentions to be premised upon
    reasonable grounds. The detention must be viewed as reasonably necessary
    on an objective view of the totality of the circumstances, informing the
    officer's suspicion that there is a clear nexus between the individual to
    be detained and a recent or on-going criminal offence.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Quite
    apart from the detention of the entire student body, of more significance
    is the unauthorized warrantless random search itself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the Crown has failed to rebut the presumption that the search was
    unreasonable.  Even if the presumption of unreasonableness did not apply,
    it is my opinion that there were no grounds upon which to justify a random
    search of the kind that was conducted in this case.</p>
