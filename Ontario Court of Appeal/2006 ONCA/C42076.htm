  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>On appeal from the convictions entered by Justice
    Nancy M. Mossip of the Superior Court of Justice on February 27, 2004 and

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>CRONK J.A.:</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was convicted of one count each of assault, assault with a weapon
    and sexual assault upon his wife, M.R., by a judge sitting without a jury.  He
    was sentenced to 30 months’ imprisonment on the sexual assault charge and
    12 months’ imprisonment, to be served concurrently, on each of the remaining
    charges.  The appellant appeals his convictions and sentences.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>I.          Facts</h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span>            </span>(1)            The
    Marriage</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant and M.R. were married in 1994 pursuant to an arranged marriage.  For
    about the next seven years, they lived with the appellant’s parents and extended
    family, during which time they had two daughters.  From September 2001 to
    February 2002, they lived in their own apartment with their children.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant and M.R.’s depiction of their marriage varied dramatically.  In
    her evidence at trial, M.R. described a course of discreditable conduct by
    the appellant during the marriage, as well as incidents in the history of
    the marriage that the Crown asserted formed part of the backdrop to the offences
    charged but that did not involve prior “bad acts” of the appellant.  M.R.’s
    testimony included evidence that the appellant was controlling and abusive
    from the outset of their marriage and that he beat her up on more than one
    occasion when they quarrelled.  M.R. also said that, while living with the
    appellant’s family: M.R. and the appellant fought frequently over little
    things; she “got along with everybody” in the household so long as she was
    obedient and conformed with the
    “rules”; if she wanted to go somewhere, she was required to obtain permission
    from her husband, his parents or his older brother; and, until 1999, the
    appellant controlled all their financial affairs, including their banking.  In
    short, according to M.R., her freedom and autonomy were strictly regulated
    by the appellant, who abused her and controlled and dominated their life
    together. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>M.R.
    also testified about the three specific incidents that gave rise to the appellant’s
    arrest.  She said that these took place over a two-week period in late January
    and early February 2002, when she and the appellant were residing in their
    own apartment.  The first incident occurred on January 27, 2002.  M.R. alleged
    that, following an argument, her husband put a shoelace around her neck and
    tightened it, remarking: “Let’s see if she dies or not” (the “choking incident”).  M.R.
    said that the children were playing nearby in the apartment at the time of
    this altercation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second incident took place on February 3, 2002.  According to M.R., during
    the course of an argument and in the presence of the children, the appellant
    punched her several times on the left side of her head with a closed fist
    and slapped her on the face with an open hand (the “punching incident”).  M.R.
    said that as a result of the appellant’s conduct, she fell to the ground,
    experienced “a lot of pain”, became disoriented, and suffered bumps to her
    head and swelling of the left side of her head.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third incident transpired on the following evening.  According to M.R., on
    this occasion, the appellant forced her to have intercourse with him over
    her objections.  This occurred when she was in bed with their sleeping children
    (the “sexual assault incident”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his testimony at trial, the appellant painted a very different picture of
    the marriage, his treatment of M.R., and their relationship with his family.  He
    said that his wife did not require permission from anyone else for her activities
    and that they lived happily and without conflict with his extended family.  He
    claimed that he was a loving and supportive husband and that his wife was
    the controlling and domineering spouse.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant denied each of the assaultive incidents giving rise to the charges
    against him.  He claimed that they never took place and that they had been
    fabricated by M.R.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant and M.R. separated briefly on two occasions while they were residing
    with the appellant’s family.  On each occasion, the appellant sought legal
    advice to obtain custody of the children.  The appellant claimed that they
    had no difficulties in their marital life once they reconciled after these
    separations.  The only issue, he said, was that his wife had a “depression
    problem” and sometimes yelled at him and the children.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the appellant and M.R. eventually moved to their own apartment, the appellant
    arranged for his lawyer to prepare a “separation”
    agreement.  It provided that the appellant would have sole custody of the
    children, and there would be no spousal support or equalization of family
    property, upon marriage breakdown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified that he and M.R. jointly agreed to the terms of this
    agreement.  In contrast, M.R. said that her husband pressured her to sign
    the agreement, telling her that they would not “live well” with each other
    unless she agreed to do so.  Ultimately, she signed the agreement.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;
'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Visits to Dr. Lin</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    February 4, 2002 – the day after the punching incident –
    M.R. went to see her family physician, Dr. James Lin, about a head injury,
    which she said was inflicted by her husband.  M.R. testified that she told
    Dr. Lin that her husband “hit me a lot” and that she showed Dr. Lin the “bumps
    by feeling them”.  She also said that Dr. Lin asked her if she wanted to
    call the police.  She refused because she believed that after she told the
    appellant that she “[had] a problem in my head”, the appellant would “stop
    doing all that”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Lin testified at trial for the Crown.  He said that during the February 4
    visit, M.R. told him that she had been assaulted by her husband, that he
    had punched her on the left side of her head, that her head hurt when Dr.
    Lin touched it, that this was not the first time that her husband had hit
    her, and that her husband wanted her to sign a document or “paper” and that
    they had argued about this, during which the appellant hit M.R. on the side
    of her head.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Lin also said that he noticed no redness or bruising on M.R.’s face when
    he saw her on February 4.  In addition, the results of an x-ray taken on
    February 5 were normal.  Based on M.R.’s report to him of tenderness on her
    left temple, Dr. Lin diagnosed a concussion.  He advised M.R. to stay home
    from work for three days, prescribed Advil and directed M.R. to apply ice
    to her head.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    accordance with Dr. Lin’s advice, M.R. stayed home from work for three days
    following February 4.  At trial, the appellant acknowledged that M.R. had
    missed work for this period, but said that he did not know why she was not
    feeling well.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>M.R.
    attended at Dr. Lin’s offices on two further occasions in the months of March
    and April 2002, complaining of dizziness, poor memory, headaches and forgetfulness.  On
    March 12, 2002, Dr. Lin diagnosed M.R. as suffering from post-concussion
    syndrome.  No treatment was ordered by him for this condition.  A CT scan
    performed that month was normal.  When he later saw her on June 6, 2002,
    Dr. Lin thought that M.R. might also be suffering from depression or anxiety.  He
    prescribed anti-depressant medication. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span> </span>(3)            Valentine’s Day,
    2002</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    his testimony, the appellant recounted a series of events that he claimed
    caused the final breakdown of the marriage.  By the appellant’s account,
    he became suspicious of M.R.’s whereabouts throughout the day on February
    14, 2002.  In an effort to locate M.R. that morning, the appellant left work
    and returned home.  When he discovered that M.R. was not at home, the appellant
    called M.R. repeatedly on her cell phone, asking where she was.  He then
    went to a drug store looking for her, to his lawyer’s office to obtain advice,
    and to his wife’s eye doctor’s office, where he confronted M.R. when she
    arrived for an appointment.  The appellant then searched M.R.’s car, thinking
    that she may have been buying a gift for him.  When M.R. returned home from
    work late that night, the appellant again confronted her.  She told him that
    she had gone shopping for a Valentine’s Day gift.  He then told M.R. that
    she had seven days to produce proof to him of the purchase of a gift.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    week later, on February 21, 2002, the appellant moved out of the marital
    apartment, taking the children with him.  M.R. testified that she learned
    of this when the appellant called her on her cell phone and told her that
    he had left her, that he had taken the children with him, and that M.R. would
    receive “papers”
    from him at a women’s shelter.  M.R. then returned home from work and discovered
    that the appellant had removed the children’s belongings, some of the furniture,
    and identification papers concerning both the children and M.R.   </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>(4)            M.R.’s Disclosure to the Police</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>M.R.
    did not initially disclose her husband’s assaults to the police.  She testified
    that she did not report the choking incident because she thought that her
    husband would change, particularly as, by the time of this incident, he had
    secured her signature on the “separation” agreement.  She also said that
    she refused to contact the police following the February 3 punching incident,
    notwithstanding Dr. Lin’s prompt that she do so, because she believed that
    when the appellant learned of her head injury, his offending behaviour would
    stop.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    when M.R. learned that the appellant had left her and taken the children
    with him, she telephoned the police.  Officer Geoffrey Belanger responded
    to the call.  M.R. testified that when she met with Officer Belanger at her
    apartment in the early hours of February 22, she told him about the “papers” that
    her husband had indicated he was going to deliver and that her husband had
    taken the children and some of their belongings.  She did not mention her
    husband’s assaultive conduct because she was concerned about the “papers” and
    about what her husband was going to do.  She said that Officer Belanger advised
    her to contact a lawyer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Officer
    Belanger testified at trial for the defence.  He said that M.R. told him
    that she had signed a separation agreement with her husband, that she didn’t
    know what she was signing at the time, that she was reporting that her husband
    had taken the children, and that she wanted the children back.  He also testified
    that he examined a document provided by M.R. and, determining that her request
    for the return of the children was a family court matter, he advised her
    that she should consult a family law lawyer.  He said that he “covered off
    any – if there were any other problems or allegations and she had no other
    allegations, other than the fact that she wanted her children back”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to Officer Belanger, M.R. made no allegation that there was any sort of assault
    or threat in conjunction with the appellant taking the children and their
    belongings.  On cross-examination, however, Officer Belanger acknowledged
    that he did not ask M.R. about the history of her life with the appellant
    or about sexual violence or assault because he did not think that the situation
    was a domestic assault matter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    February 24, M.R. met with Officer Manny Barbara at a women’s shelter.  M.R.
    testified that, although she told Officer Barbara about the punching incident,
    she did not mention the choking or sexual assault incidents because she thought
    that the police would say that the reporting of the former incident was “too
    late” and, with respect to the sexual assault incident, because she did not
    meet with a female police officer.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Officer
    Barbara also testified at trial for the defence.  He said that M.R. told
    him that she wanted her husband charged because she thought that this would
    give her custody of the children.  M.R. was not cross-examined at trial on
    this alleged statement to the police officer.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    February 28, 2002, the appellant and M.R. had attended in court and an interim
    custody order had been granted, on consent.  It provided for the children
    to be with the appellant, except for weekday mornings and weekends, when
    they would be with M.R.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About
    one month later, after an altercation with her mother-in-law, M.R. went to
    the police and disclosed a full history of her marriage to a female police
    officer.  This included a recounting of her husband’s alleged assaultive
    behaviour and, in particular, the choking, punching and sexual assault incidents.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>II.        Issues</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    support of his conviction appeal, the appellant argues that the trial judge
    erred: (i) in her treatment of M.R.’s evidence of the appellant’s prior discreditable
    conduct during the marriage; (ii) by reversing the burden of proof and applying
    a higher degree of scrutiny to the defence evidence at trial than she applied
    to the evidence of M.R.; (iii) in her treatment of the evidence of M.R.’s
    statements to her doctor following the punching incident; and (iv) by failing
    to properly consider the defence evidence of the appellant’s good character.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also seeks leave to appeal against sentence, arguing that the trial
    judge erred by concluding that a penitentiary sentence was required in this
    case and by failing to impose a conditional sentence.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>III.            Analysis</h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>A.            Conviction Appeal</h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;
'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evidence
    of Discreditable Conduct</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred by admitting the evidence of
    the appellant’s prior discreditable conduct and by treating this evidence
    as relevant to M.R.’s credibility.  Relying particularly on <i>R. v. Handy</i> (2002),
    164 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.), the appellant argues that this set too low
    a threshold for the admissibility of the discreditable conduct evidence,
    the real purpose of which was simply to “bolster” the complainant’s credibility
    and to establish that the appellant was a “bad” person.  The appellant also
    asserts that the trial judge erred by admitting the discreditable conduct
    evidence without first considering its prejudicial effect and, further, by
    failing to identify its limited permissible use.  I would reject these submissions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s ruling regarding the admissibility of the prior discreditable
    conduct evidence was brief.  It read as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   The Crown’s application as filed with respect
    to the evidence of prior marital abuse and disharmony and the evidence as
    set out in their factum will be admissible.  I have reviewed the case law.  It
    is clear to me that this evidence has a probative value to this court.  As
    set out in the case law, it goes to the history of the relationship.  It
    goes to the credibility of the complainant.  It goes to refute the defence’s
    argument of fabrication, and it [is] highly probative as to the nature of
    the relationship between the accused and the complainant.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   As to the weight to be given, it will obviously
    depend upon the cross-examination and the evidence of the accused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    the Crown and defence counsel at trial filed detailed written facta and made
    oral submissions on the <i>voir dire</i> conducted to determine the admissibility
    of the discreditable conduct evidence.  No doubt for that reason, the trial
    judge’s ruling in support of the admission of this evidence was succinct.  In
    my view, her ruling does not reflect legal error.  I say this for several
    reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the trial judge’s ruling must be understood in the context of the positions
    taken and the submissions made by the parties on the <i>voir dire</i>.  In
    its factum, the Crown argued that the evidence of the appellant’s prior discreditable
    conduct was admissible to:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) complete the narrative by permitting comprehension
    of the true nature of the relationship [between the appellant and M.R.];</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) assist in refuting the anticipated defence
    that the complaint was fabricated by explaining the basis for [M.R.’s] fear,
    why she did not leave the marriage, why she did not report the incidents
    sooner, and why she did not report the incidents more fully when given the
    opportunity;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c) explain the power and control dynamics in the
    relationship;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(d) demonstrate possible motive or animus on the
    part of the [appellant]; and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(e) avoid making [M.R.] describe a single act of
    violence in a vacuous context and consequently run the risk that a trier
    of fact might unfairly discredit her testimony.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown also asserted that the evidence of specific incidents in the history
    of the marriage that did not involve prior “bad acts”
    of the appellant was relevant to:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) providing background to the narrative;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>eliminating
    gaps and providing chronological cohesion;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>creating
    a logical framework in which to present the central allegations;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>explaining
    delay in reporting and disclosures; and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(e)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>establishing
    how a complaint came to be made when it was made.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    its submissions on the <i>voir dire</i>, the Crown referred to <i>R. v. F.(D.S.)</i> (1999),
    132 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.), <i>R. v. Batte </i>(2000), 145 C.C.C. (3d)
    449 (Ont. C.A.), and <i>Handy, supra</i>,<i> </i>in support of its argument
    that evidence of propensity, while generally inadmissible, may be admitted
    on an exceptional basis where the probative value of the evidence in respect
    of an issue in question is so high that it displaces the heavy prejudice
    to an accused to be occasioned by its admission.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, therefore, the issues in respect of which the discreditable conduct
    evidence was said to be relevant were clearly identified by the Crown, as
    were the legal principles governing the admissibility of such evidence, including
    those enunciated in <i>Handy</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s ruling confirms that she reviewed the relevant legal authorities
    prior to determining the admissibility of the discreditable conduct evidence.  Having
    conducted this review, she then concluded that the proffered evidence was
    admissible because it was relevant to the history and nature of the relationship
    between the appellant and M.R. and refutation of the appellant’s anticipated
    defence of fabrication, as well as M.R.’s credibility.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Handy</i>,
    at para. 116, Binnie J. of the Supreme Court of Canada noted, “Anything that
    blackens the character of an accused may, as a by-product, enhance the credibility
    of the complainant.”  He went on to emphasize that the identification of
    credibility as the “issue in question” on an application to admit evidence
    of discreditable conduct “may, unless circumscribed, risk the admission of
    evidence of nothing more than general disposition (‘bad personhood’)”.  Propensity
    reasoning that is based solely on the general bad character of an accused
    is prohibited.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    view of <i>Handy</i>, it would have been preferable had the trial judge not
    identified M.R.’s credibility generally as one of the issues in respect of
    which the discreditable conduct evidence was admissible.  But the admission
    of this evidence was firmly anchored in its relevance to the other issues
    identified by the trial judge and outlined by the Crown in its factum.  The
    evidence was admissible to explain the nature and dynamic of the relationship
    between the appellant and M.R., to demonstrate the appellant’s animus toward
    M.R., to assist in explaining M.R.’s delay in fully disclosing the assaultive
    acts of her husband, and to rebut the appellant’s claim of fabrication by
    M.R.: see <i>F.(D.S.), supra</i>, at paras. 19-20, 22 and 25-27.  Moreover,
    unlike the facts in <i>Handy</i>, the evidence in this case was provided
    by M.R. herself, and not by a third party.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    and importantly, although the defence initially challenged the admissibility
    of the discreditable conduct evidence, the record reveals that during his
    submissions on the <i>voir dire</i>, defence counsel at trial effectively
    acknowledged that this evidence was admissible, subject to the trial judge’s
    ultimate determination of the weight to be assigned to the evidence, if any.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    I do not agree with the appellant’s contention that the trial judge admitted
    the discreditable conduct evidence without first evaluating its prejudicial
    effect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the course of his oral submissions on the <i>voir dire</i>, defence counsel
    argued that the challenged evidence was “of so little probative value that
    the prejudicial effect cannot be outweighed by the probative value for the
    court’s eyes”, that it was “of virtually no probative value on the issue
    of power and control”, and that it was for the trial judge to determine whether
    some of the issues to which the evidence was said by the Crown to be relevant
    were “so vague that their probative value is … outweighed by its prejudic[ial]
    effect”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the light of those submissions, I regard the trial judge’s comments that
    the evidence had “a probative value to this court” and that it was “highly
    probative as to the nature of the relationship between the accused and [M.R.]” as
    a ‘shorthand’ method of referencing the requisite balancing of the probative
    value of the evidence against its prejudicial effect.  The trial judge’s
    ruling, although terse, was clearly responsive to the submissions of counsel
    on the <i>voir dire</i>.  Read in that context, it implicitly indicates that
    the trial judge was alive to, and assessed, the potential prejudicial effect
    of the discreditable conduct evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, given her review of the case law governing the admission of the
    discreditable conduct evidence and the nature of counsels’
    submissions on the <i>voir dire</i>, I am not persuaded that the trial judge
    failed to then undertake the requisite balancing of the probative value of
    the evidence against its prejudicial effect.  In my view, the record does
    not support this conclusion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    I also disagree with the appellant’s submission that the trial judge fatally
    erred by failing to identify the permissible use of the discreditable conduct
    evidence.  During the <i>voir dire</i>, the trial judge posed the following
    question to counsel:
    “[B]ut what use I can make of it, what use I can make of this evidence?”  Although
    it would have been of assistance had the trial judge specifically instructed
    herself on the use to which the discreditable conduct evidence could be put,
    she was not obliged to do so.  The trial judge’s exchanges with counsel on
    the <i>voir dire</i> demonstrate that she was alive to the fact that the
    proper use of such evidence was limited.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
    importantly, although the trial judge did not expressly caution herself on
    the well-established impermissible uses of evidence of prior discreditable
    conduct, there is nothing on this record to suggest that the evidence, once
    admitted, was used by the trial judge for a prohibited purpose. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p style='page-break-after:avoid'><b>(2)</b>             <b>Reversal of Burden

page-break-after:avoid'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    do I accept that the trial judge erred by reversing the burden of proof or
    by applying a disproportionate level of scrutiny to the defence evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>M.R.
    and Dr. Lin were the only Crown witnesses at trial.  As I have indicated,
    the appellant testified at trial.  He also called K.R. (his sister-in-law),
    and Officers Belanger and Barbara as witnesses, together with four character
    witnesses.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    commencing her analysis of the evidence, the trial judge observed that credibility
    was a central issue in the case.  She then stated, “[I]t is wrong in law
    to pit the complainant’s version of events against the accused’s version
    of events.”  Thus, the trial judge correctly recognized that her analysis
    could not be premised on a credibility contest between the appellant and
    M.R.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge next expressly directed herself concerning the principles set
    out in <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i> (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.).  She then
    considered the inconsistencies in M.R.’s evidence and concluded “in the context
    of all the other evidence” that M.R. was a truthful and convincing witness.  The
    trial judge set out detailed reasons for reaching this conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
    the trial judge addressed the credibility of the appellant and his sister-in-law,
    K.R., and the reliability of their testimony.  She provided detailed reasons
    for her rejection of their evidence, stating:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   I found the testimony of [the appellant] not
    to be truthful.  It is to be remembered that his core testimony was that
    none of the conduct attributed to him took place.  [The appellant’s] credibility
    was significantly impaired during the course of the Crown’s cross-examination.  To
    put it bluntly, [the appellant] was a dreadful witness, <i>and I have concluded
    that his testimony was simply unworthy of belief</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   [The appellant’s] testimony made no sense and
    was at variance with some aspects of everyday experience.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>….</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   I found the evidence of the sister-in-law to
    be scripted and to be incredible evidence.  The sister-in-law was returning
    to live with [the appellant’s] parents and [the appellant] himself.  She
    was in a difficult situation.  <i>However, I did not find her evidence to
    be of any assistance in raising a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of </i><i>[the
    appellant].</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   <i>In light of the instruction I gave myself
      with respect to R. v. W.D., and for all of the above reasons, I do not
      believe [the appellant’s] testimony nor does his testimony leave me in
      any doubt as to his guilt on all three counts in the indictment.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>   In considering the totality of the evidence
      of the Crown presented at this trial</i>, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable
      doubt that [the appellant] committed the three offences set out in the
      indictment [emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>These comments clearly indicate
    that the trial judge properly applied the principles enunciated in <i>R.
    v. W.(D.)</i> in this case and that, upon that application, she was satisfied
    beyond a reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt on the offences charged.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant relies on the following passage from the trial judge’s reasons
    to argue that the trial judge reversed the burden of proof:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[The appellant] was aware that his wife had gone
    to the doctor about a head injury on February 4, 2002.  <i>He offered no
    explanation to this court as to why she had a head injury, nor why she was
    off three days from work with a head injury. … Again, [the appellant] offered
    no explanation as to why he did not ask her about her injury and I find this
    fact defies credulity</i> [emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    first blush, the trial judge’s references to the appellant’s failures to “offer…an
    explanation” are troubling.  However, they appear in the trial judge’s reasons
    as part of a lengthy recitation of the factors relied upon by the trial judge
    as the basis for her conclusion that the appellant was an unreliable witness.  One
    of these factors involved rejecting the appellant’s claim that he was a supportive
    and communicative husband.  Read in this context, it is clear that, rather
    than reversing the burden of proof, the trial judge simply concluded that
    the evidence given by the appellant defied belief, thereby significantly
    undermining his credibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I,
    therefore, do not accept that the impugned passage from the trial judge’s
    reasons indicates that she imposed an onus on the appellant to lead evidence.  In
    all the circumstances, I am satisfied that the trial judge’s reasons reflect
    no reversal of the burden of proof or erosion of the presumption of innocence,
    nor any approach to the evaluation of the evidence that was slanted in favour
    of the complainant. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>(3)            M.R.’s Statements to Dr. Lin</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge erred in her treatment of the evidence
    of M.R.’s statements to Dr. Lin on February 4, 2002 in three related ways:
    first, by using the evidence regarding these statements to “bolster” M.R.’s
    credibility to rebut an allegation of fabrication; second, by relying on
    M.R.’s statements for the truth of their contents; and third, by misapprehending
    the import of Dr. Lin’s evidence regarding M.R.’s condition on February 4.  I
    would reject these submissions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    considering Dr. Lin’s evidence of M.R.’s February 4 visit in her reasons,
    the trial judge explicitly directed herself as follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   The assessment and diagnosis of Dr. Lin is based
    entirely on what [M.R.] told him about her symptoms and what had happened
    to her.  <i>I instruct myself that </i><i>[M.R.’s] complaints to the Dr.
    are not to be used for the truth of those statements</i> [emphasis added]<i>.</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then continued:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   However, I did find it important that [M.R.]
    attended at Dr. Lin’s office complaining of an assault by her husband, prior
    to the final separation of the parties, and prior to the commencement of
    any court proceedings with respect to the custody of the children.  Further,
    this attendance at the doctor’s is one of three days that [M.R.] took off
    from work following what she alleged was an assault on her by her husband.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsequently,
    when listing the factors that she regarded as relevant to her conclusion
    that M.R. was a truthful witness, the trial judge stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>The fact that [M.R.] attended at her doctor
      the day after the physical assault to her head [lent] corroboration and
      credibility to that assault having taken place.</i>  The parties did not
      separate at the time of this assault, and it makes no sense that [M.R.]
      went to the doctor on February 4, 2002, in order to assist in fabricating
      assault charges against her husband, when she never charged him with assault
      at that time.  <i>Bearing in mind my earlier comments with respect to how
      Dr. Lin arrived at his diagnosis, and the use I may make of information
      [M.R.] gave her doctor, I find the fact that [M.R] went to the doctor and
      that the doctor diagnosed her with a head concussion provided some corroboration
      that the assault occurred</i> [emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, properly read, these comments do not reflect an impermissible use
    by the trial judge of the evidence of M.R.’s statements to Dr. Lin.  I say
    this for three reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    I reject the appellant’s claim that the trial judge improperly used the evidence
    of M.R.’s statements to Dr. Lin to bolster M.R.’s credibility to rebut an
    allegation of recent fabrication.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant asserts that the trial judge’s reliance on the fact and timing
    of M.R.’s February 4 visit to her doctor reflects a misapprehension of both
    the defence theory relating to fabrication by M.R. and of the evidence relevant
    to that theory.  He submits that, rather than recent fabrication, the theory
    of the defence was fabrication generally.  Further, he contends that the
    evidence at trial made it clear that M.R.’s motive to fabricate pre-dated
    her disclosure to Dr. Lin.  In that respect, he submits that Officer Barbara’s
    testimony regarding the statements made to him by M.R. on February 24 demonstrated
    that M.R. was motivated to make false allegations against the appellant in
    a bid to improve her chances of obtaining custody of the children.  He argues
    that while M.R.’s statements to Officer Barbara post-dated her disclosure
    to Dr. Lin of assaultive conduct by the appellant, M.R.’s motivation to fabricate
    pre-dated that disclosure because a possible custody contest was a live issue
    prior to February 4.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am not persuaded that the trial judge misapprehended either the defence theory
    of fabrication or the evidence relating to it.  At trial, the defence mounted
    a strenuous attack on M.R.’s credibility for failing to disclose her allegations
    earlier than she did.  Near the end of M.R.’s cross-examination, defence
    counsel suggested to M.R. that, by February 24, she had become frustrated
    with the police for their failure to charge the appellant after she told
    them that he had punched her in the head.  Defence counsel then referred
    to M.R.’s subsequent attendance at the police station on March 20 and put
    the following question to M.R.:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>And I’m going to suggest to you that it was
    at that time that you decided to make up this entire story about your husband’s
    misconduct towards you?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, this extract from M.R.’s cross-examination indicates that recent
    fabrication was an element of the defence position at trial.  What may not
    have been clear was the incidents to which the allegation of recent fabrication
    related.  In the lead-up to the question set out above, defence counsel referred
    specifically to M.R.’s previous disclosure of the punching incident.  To
    the extent that there was a suggestion of recent fabrication relating to
    the punching incident, at its core it amounted to an allegation of exaggeration.  Moreover,
    it is apparent that the defence position at trial encompassed not only recent
    fabrication, but also fabrication generally.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    do I accept the appellant’s submission that the trial judge misapprehended
    the evidence relating to M.R.’s motive to fabricate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that because there had been previous separations and issues
    between M.R. and the appellant relating to the custody of their children,
    the trial judge’s references to the timing of M.R.’s disclosure to Dr. Lin
    (being prior to the final separation on February 21 and before the commencement
    of any court proceedings) reflect a misapprehension of the evidence relating
    to M.R.’s motive to fabricate.  I disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    their face, M.R.’s statements to Dr. Lin that she was assaulted by the appellant
    do not address the aspects of her evidence that the defence alleged were
    recently concocted (the choking incident and the sexual assault incident).  Therefore,
    the evidence of M.R.’s disclosure to Dr. Lin does not rebut directly the
    allegation of recent fabrication.  Further, read fairly, the trial judge’s
    comments regarding the fact and timing of M.R.’s disclosure to Dr. Lin were
    part of an overall assessment by the trial judge of M.R.’s pattern of disclosure
    and its effect on M.R.’s credibility generally, and not as a response to
    the allegation of recent fabrication.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is implicit in the trial judge’s reasons that she considered the timing of
    M.R.’s February 4 attendance on Dr. Lin in two contexts: first, in relation
    to the timing of the punching incident, and second, in relation to the status
    of the relationship between M.R. and the appellant at that time.  After considering
    both contexts, the trial judge concluded that, rather than being an attempt
    to falsely implicate the appellant in criminal conduct as a means of gaining
    custody of the children, M.R.’s attendance on Dr. Lin and her statements
    to him were for the purpose of obtaining medical attention.  Ultimately,
    the trial judge found that M.R.’s pattern of disclosure did not reveal fabrication.  For
    that reason, among others, the trial judge rejected the defence allegations
    of both fabrication and recent fabrication.  Viewed in their entirety, therefore,
    the trial judge’s comments concerning the fact and timing of M.R.’s February
    4 attendance on Dr. Lin do not reveal any misapprehension of the evidence
    concerning when a motive by M.R. to fabricate arose.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    I am not persuaded that the trial judge used the evidence of M.R.’s statements
    to Dr. Lin improperly for the purpose of proving the truth of the contents
    of the statements.  When dealing with Dr. Lin’s evidence on this issue, the
    trial judge instructed herself explicitly that she could not use the statements
    for the truth of their contents.  Later in her reasons, she again adverted
    to this important restriction on the use to which the evidence could be put.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this context, the trial judge concluded that the uncontroverted <i>fact</i> of
    M.R.’s February 4 attendance at her doctor’s office and the <i>timing</i> of
    that attendance provided “some corroboration”
    for M.R.’s claim of an assault.  While this use by the trial judge of the
    word “corroboration” was misplaced, the trier of fact in any criminal case
    is entitled, when assessing a complainant’s credibility, to consider whether
    the conduct of the complainant is consistent or inconsistent with the complainant’s
    evidence of what occurred: <i>R. v. Ay</i> (1994), 93 C.C.C. (3d) 456 (B.C.C.A.)
    at 469.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree that the trial judge should not have used the term
    “corroboration” in the manner employed in her reasons for judgment.  However,
    she was entitled to find, as she clearly did, that M.R.’s attendance on Dr.
    Lin supported M.R.’s credibility.  The evidence of the fact and timing of
    M.R.’s February 4 visit to Dr. Lin, taken with the rest of the evidence,
    was relevant to the assessment of M.R.’s credibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    I do not accept the appellant’s submission that the trial judge misapprehended
    the import of Dr. Lin’s evidence.  In this regard, the appellant contends
    that because Dr. Lin’s evidence of his physical findings upon examination
    of M.R. on February 4 did not support M.R.’s account of the physical injuries
    that she suffered as a result of the punching incident, Dr. Lin’s evidence
    should have caused the trial judge to have a reasonable doubt about M.R.’s
    allegations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Obviously,
    the trial judge could have taken a different view of the significance of
    Dr. Lin’s evidence.  Further, it would have been preferable had the trial
    judge specifically addressed in her reasons her view of the import of the
    discrepancy in the evidence concerning M.R.’s injuries relating to the punching
    incident.  However, it was open to the trial judge to find, as she implicitly
    did, that what was important about Dr. Lin’s evidence was the fact and timing
    of M.R.’s decision to seek medical attention and, having made that finding,
    that any discrepancy in M.R.’s evidence concerning the extent of her injuries
    was not sufficient to undermine her credibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would reject this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>(4)            Good Character Evidence</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that the trial judge erred by holding that the defence
    evidence of the appellant’s good character had no relevance to sexual offences;
    by failing to take it into account in her assessment of the appellant’s credibility;
    and by failing to consider it in relation to the non-sexual offences with
    which the appellant was charged.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge stated in her reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   In my assessment of the evidence in this case
    I have taken into account the character witnesses proffered by the defence,
    which evidence was that in the community and at work [the appellant] is known
    for his honesty and integrity.  As courts have noted in the past, sexual
    misconduct in particular occurs in private, and in most cases will not be
    reflected in the reputation in the community of the accused for morality.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, these comments do not suggest that the trial judge dismissed the
    value of the good character evidence “out of hand” or that she failed to
    consider it.  The appellant was unable to point to any part of the trial
    judge’s reasons that called into question the trial judge’s direct statement
    that she took the good character evidence into account in her overall assessment
    of the evidence including, therefore, her assessment of the evidence bearing
    upon the appellant’s credibility and the likelihood that he committed the
    offences charged.  In the absence of some indication to the contrary, there
    is no reason to conclude that the trial judge did not do exactly what she
    said she had done.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    do I regard the trial judge’s comment about the limited value of character
    evidence to offences that occur in private as a holding by her that the evidence
    of the appellant’s character was irrelevant in the circumstances of this
    case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s observation that sexual misconduct occurs in private and, hence,
    that evidence of the good character of an accused charged with a sexual offence
    may have limited value, was accurate.  It does not indicate that she failed
    to consider the evidence of the appellant’s character when assessing his
    credibility and the likelihood that he committed the offences charged.  Rather,
    the comment in issue indicates that the trial judge tempered the mitigating
    value of the good character evidence, as she was entitled to do, in view
    of the fact that sexual and domestic violence offences often take place in
    private, in the absence of any witnesses.  It was for the trial judge to
    determine what weight to attach to the good character evidence, if any.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    also agree with the Crown that the good character evidence in this case was
    not particularly strong when considered in the light of the other evidence.  For
    example, the appellant’s own description of the events of February 14, 2002,
    which I outlined earlier in these reasons, demonstrated that he was capable
    of being controlling and suspicious, as alleged by M.R.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I see no error in the trial judge’s treatment of the evidence of the appellant’s
    character in the community.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>B.            Sentence Appeal</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her reasons for sentence, the trial judge stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my review of all of the cases, however, except
    in extraordinary circumstances involving very dated offences, ill health,
    mental health issues, extreme remorse and such other factors, the within
    offences warrant a penitentiary sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits, and the Crown concedes, that this was an error.  I agree.  To
    the extent that the trial judge’s statement indicated a conclusion by her
    that a penitentiary sentence was mandatory for a first offender, like the
    appellant, on the offences charged, the trial judge erred in principle.  This
    court is required, therefore, to consider a fit sentence in all the circumstances
    without the usual deference to the sentencing judge’s disposition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge imposed a sentence of 30 months’ imprisonment on the sexual assault
    charge and a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment on each of the remaining
    two charges, to be served concurrently.  In my view, these sentences were
    appropriate for this offender and these offences.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the appellant had no prior criminal record, the offences were serious and
    occasioned considerable emotional trauma to M.R.  They occurred in the context
    of a domestic relationship while young children were present in the home,
    in close proximity.  Indeed, in the instance of the sexual assault, the crime
    was perpetrated while M.R. was in bed with the sleeping children.  In addition,
    the offences were not isolated occurrences.  They took place against the
    backdrop of a lengthy abusive relationship.  Moreover, unlike many of the
    cases relied upon by the appellant, no guilty plea operates in mitigation
    of sentence.  The offences here require a denunciatory sentence that also
    meets the requirements of general and specific deterrence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that a conditional sentence is appropriate and filed fresh
    evidence with this court in support of that submission.  I disagree.  Based
    on the factors that I have outlined, the sentencing objectives outlined in
    the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, s. 718 are best served by
    a sentence of 30 months’ incarceration on the sexual assault charge and 12
    months’ incarceration on each of the remaining charges, to be served concurrently.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>IV.            Disposition</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    for the reasons given, I would dismiss the appeal from conviction.  I would
    grant leave to appeal sentence and dismiss the sentence appeal.</p>
