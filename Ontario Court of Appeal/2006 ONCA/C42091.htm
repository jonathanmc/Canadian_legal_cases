      Court of Justice dated June 4, 2004, reported at [2004] O.J. No. 3087.</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FELDMAN J.A.:</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;page-break-after:avoid'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    circumstances that gave rise to this case were most unfortunate. The appellant,
    Paul Wesley Rhora, was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 1982 or 1983 and
    put on a lithium regimen. At some point prior to the events that gave rise
    to this action in March and April 1991, he stopped taking his medication.
    On or about March 26, 1991, when the appellant was intoxicated, he hit his
    head in his apartment and fell unconscious. He attended the local hospital,
    was treated and released.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    Easter Sunday, March 31, 1991, the appellant called the police and asked
    them to come and arrest him for growing marijuana. He said he was afraid
    that some people would take his plants and hurt or kill him. When the police
    arrived, they found the appellant armed with a knife and a pellet gun and
    with broken glass in his pockets; his room had been trashed and he reported
    that he had been taking heroin. The police charged him with possession of
    weapons and took him into custody. They noted that he was acting strangely,
    but that he was calm. Although they considered using s. 11 of the <i>Mental
    Health Act</i>, R.S.O. 1980, c. 262 (now R.S.O. 1990, c. M.7, s. 17) to take
    him to a hospital, they decided that by arresting him, any danger to him
    or others would be addressed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was kept at the police station for one night, then transferred
    the next morning to the detention centre for which the respondent, Mr. Villeneuve,
    was the Superintendent. While the appellant was in police custody, the police
    learned from his ex-wife that he suffered from a chemical imbalance of the
    brain and had been prescribed lithium. This information was not reported
    to the detention centre.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    there, the detention centre did learn from relatives of the appellant that
    he had a six-year psychiatric history. Because of his strange behaviour in
    the centre, as well as his aggressive conduct during a visit from his brothers
    and the concerns expressed by them, the appellant was placed in the psychiatric
    unit, though not alone but in a cell with two other men. An appointment with
    a psychiatrist was made for the following day. Unfortunately, that night
    the appellant fought with the other two men, claiming that one of them, Mr.
    Taylor, had given him AIDS. As a result of the fight, Mr. Taylor died.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was taken to hospital for his physical wounds and the next day
    saw the staff psychiatrist at the detention centre. No medication was prescribed.
    The next day the appellant injured himself as a result of banging his head
    against the wall in his cell. Yet it was not until the following day, when
    he again saw the psychiatrist, that psychometric medication was prescribed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was tried for the murder of his cell-mate and found not guilty
    by reason of mental disorder on June 25, 1991. He was held on a warrant of
    committal until September 1999, when he was released back into the community
    on a lithium regimen.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant and his family brought this action against the police and the detention
    centre for negligence by (1) failing to immediately apply s. 11 of the <i>Mental
    Health Act</i> and send him for a psychiatric assessment, and (2) failing
    to detect his psychiatric condition, send him for psychiatric assessment
    or administer psychometric drugs in a timely manner. They claim that it was
    as a consequence of that negligence that the appellant killed Mr. Taylor,
    resulting in his eight-year committal, and that he also suffered significant
    further head injury. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge dismissed the action. He found that the police and the detention
    centre did not fall below the standard of care required of them in this case,
    and that, in any event, any damages that the appellant suffered were not
    foreseeable and were too remote. The trial judge also found no systemic negligence.
    Finally, the trial judge concluded that he was not satisfied that the appellant’s
    head injury that occurred while he was in custody caused his damage but that
    the damage probably occurred earlier when he struck his head and fell unconscious
    at home.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Although
    he found no liability, the trial judge assessed the plaintiffs’ damages as
    follows: $50,000 general damages for diminution of quality of life; $252,750
    for lost wages and $5,000 to each child in respect of <i>Family Law Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3 claims. The appellant appeals the findings that deny
    liability.</p>

  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, on this record, this appeal cannot succeed for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All
    four of the matters complained of by the appellant concern, to a greater
    or lesser extent, factual findings made by the trial judge.  These findings,
    of course, attract considerable deference from this court.  Absent palpable
    and overriding error, appellate interference with these findings is precluded.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The  challenge
    of the trial judge’s factual findings rests primarily on the assertion that
    the trial judge failed to consider evidence that, in the appellant’s view,
    was relevant to the determination of whether the respondents were negligent.  There
    are two difficulties with this submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    was a lengthy trial of approximately three weeks duration.  The trial judge’s
    reasons are comprehensive, numbering 73 pages in total.  They include a detailed
    description of the evidence concerning the events surrounding the appellant’s
    arrest, his subsequent transfer to the detention centre, his custody and
    treatment at that facility, his condition throughout, and the nature of the
    information concerning the appellant’s condition and mental status known
    to the respondents at the relevant times.  The trial judge’s factual findings
    on these matters were available to him on the evidence.  The appellant essentially
    invites this court to retry the case by re-weighing the evidence adduced
    at trial.  That is not the function of this court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, the fact that the trial judge failed to mention some of the evidence
    in his reasons does not establish that he failed to consider the omitted
    evidence in arriving at his decision that the appellant’s claims should be
    dismissed.  Such omissions do not necessarily constitute reversible error.  As
    stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Housen v. Nikolaisen</i>, [2002]
    2 S.C.R. 235 at 264, quoting from <i>Van de Perre v. Edwards</i>, [2001]
    2 S.C.R. 1014, “an omission is only a material error if it gives rise to
    the reasoned belief that the trial judge must have forgotten, ignored or
    misconceived the evidence in a way that affected his conclusion.  Without
    this reasoned belief, the appellate court cannot reconsider the evidence”.  I
    am not persuaded that the appellant has met this test in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if I were persuaded that the trial judge erred in his conclusion that the
    respondents met the appropriate standard of care, the appellant’s case on
    appeal breaks down on the issue of causation.  The trial judge acknowledged
    that it would have been preferable had the police communicated to the detention
    centre the information that they had obtained about the appellant’s mental
    illness. However, he concluded that any failure of communication by the police
    was not the proximate cause of the killing or of any further injury to the
    appellant and that any damages the appellant suffered were too remote. In
    my view, the trial judge made no palpable or overriding error in so concluding
    and there is no basis for this court to interfere with those findings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    similar analysis applies with respect to any deficiencies in the timeliness
    with which the detention centre administered psychometric medication to the
    appellant. In fact, although the appellant saw a psychiatrist following the
    killing, no psychometric medication was prescribed for him until a few days
    later, following his head-banging behaviour. To the extent that the detention
    centre should have responded earlier to the behaviour of the appellant and
    the information from his family by obtaining a psychiatric consultation sooner
    than it did, any such deficiency was not the proximate cause of the tragic
    events that occurred. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also contends that the trial judge erred in law in his interpretation
    of s. 11 of the <i>Mental Health Act</i> by finding that in deciding what
    was “normal” in applying the section, the police should take into account
    factors relating to the nature of the appellant’s neighbourhood and its residents.
    The section, as it read at the time, stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>s. 11. Where
    a constable or other peace officer observes a person who acts in a manner
    that in a normal person would be disorderly and has reasonable cause to believe
    that the person</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>(a) has threatened or attempted or is threatening or attempting to cause
    bodily harm to himself;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>(b) has behaved or is behaving violently towards another person or has
    caused or is causing another person to fear bodily harm from him; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>(c) has shown or is showing a lack of competence to care for himself,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>and in addition the constable or other peace officer is of the opinion
    that the person is apparently suffering from mental disorder of a nature
    or quality that likely will result in,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>(d) serious bodily harm to the person;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>(e) serious bodily harm to another person; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>(f) imminent and serious physical impairment of the person,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>and that it would be dangerous to proceed under s. 10 [bringing information
    on oath before a justice of the peace for an order for assessment by a physician],
    the constable or other peace officer may take the person in custody to an
    appropriate place for assessment by a physician.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the appellant that s. 11 of the <i>Mental Health Act </i>is not
    concerned with the place of residence of the person said to be in need of
    assistance and it was an error for the trial judge to state that the police
    in this case were to compare the appellant’s behaviour to what could be normal
    for someone living in one of Hamilton’s toughest neighbourhoods and who had
    some involvement with drugs. This type of analysis could well result in a
    hands-off approach by the police to people who may be in dire need of psychiatric
    help. This would further disadvantage those who are already living on the
    fringes of society. On the other hand, the police were entitled to consider
    the fact that the appellant told them he had been taking heroin when they
    assessed whether his behaviour was “disorderly” as compared to a “normal” person,
    in the context of s. 11. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    spite of the legal error, it was apparent that while the police officers
    who responded to the appellant’s call did consider him to be acting very
    strangely, they </p>
  <br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>determined that he did not meet the other criteria of s. 11 and, on that basis,
    decided not to seek an assessment. The fact that the appellant had admittedly
    taken heroin would certainly affect his judgment and perceptions. He was
    also calm and compliant with the officers. In my view, it cannot be said
    on this record that the officers erred in their decision, setting aside the
    effect of any reference to the character of the neighbourhood as part of
    their assessment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge properly observed that police officers are not trained in the
    diagnosis of citizens “who may require specialized treatment outside of the <i>Mental
    Health Act</i>,” and that the Act “does not …require detailed ‘curb-side’ diagnoses
    by the police absent obvious, anomalous behaviour that is threatening to
    someone, including the person involved”. Obviously, police are not psychiatric
    professionals. That said, it is apparent from many aspects of this case,
    including the initial arrest of the appellant, that it would be helpful for
    the police to have more training in evaluating abnormal behaviour, so that
    they are able to make the best judgment possible to apply the criteria of
    the Act in the interests of the individual and of society.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also erred in law by stating that the police have no obligation
    to revisit a decision not to seek an assessment under s. 11 if they learn
    new relevant information, such as in this case, that the appellant suffered
    from a “chemical imbalance of the brain” and had been prescribed lithium.
    The trial judge quoted the following passage from the Hamilton-Wentworth
    Regional Police “Position and Procedure” manual with respect to “Mental Illness
    and Police Responsibility”, and concluded that that manual described the
    applicable standard of care for police officers:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[S]pecial care
    shall be afforded to prisoners who are suspected of or known to be, or to
    have previously been mentally ill, violent and/or suicidal, in order to ensure
    the safety and well being of the prisoner and all H.W.R.P. personnel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Clearly,
    the manual does not override a police officer’s statutory obligations under
    s. 11 of the Act. Although taking “special care” in such circumstances is
    an obvious good practice, it does not take the place of applying s. 11 and
    seeking a psychiatric assessment where the criteria in s. 11 are met. Again
    I refer to the need for appropriate training of police officers in this regard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the trial judge misconstrued the legal obligation on the police, he did not
    make a palpable and overriding error when he concluded on the evidence before
    him and based on the standards that existed at that time, that without other
    signs of violence in the appellant’s behaviour, the police were not negligent
    when they did not refer the appellant for an assessment after learning of
    his mental illness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellant contends that the trial judge erred in law in his consideration
    of the requisite elements of systemic negligence and in his application of
    the governing principles regarding systemic negligence to the facts of this
    case.  The trial judge found that the detention centre personnel owed the
    appellant “a duty to take reasonable care to protect him from foreseeable
    risks”. He correctly referred to the following definition of systemic negligence
    from the Supreme Court of Canada decision in <i>Rumley v. British Columbia</i>,
    [2001] 3 S.C.R. 184 at para. 30: “the failure to have in place management
    and operations procedures that would reasonably have prevented the [tortious
    action]”. However, he then modified that test by adopting some language from
    the British Columbia Supreme Court decision in <i>White v. Canada (A.G.) </i>(2002),
    4 B.C.L.R. (4<span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New Roman"'>th</span>)&nbsp;161
    and concluded at para. 138 that: “To succeed in an action for ‘systemic’ negligence,
    then, the plaintiff must establish that the negligent actions of one or more
    of the defendants were directed towards a ‘general’ rather than a ‘specific’ set
    of circumstances.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree that the effect of this language on the proper articulation of the
    test is confusing. But the trial judge made no error when he considered the
    question of systemic negligence because he applied the <i>Rumley</i> test.
    He approved of the policies and procedures in place in the detention centre
    and contained in the manual that was used and followed by the relevant personnel
    in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
    although the trial judge erred in his articulation of the requirements for
    systemic negligence, he did not make a palpable and overriding error of fact
    or err in law in his application of the test. He was entitled to conclude
    that the procedures in place at the detention centre at the time to identify
    and deal with potentially dangerous or mentally unstable persons were reasonably
    adequate to prevent what occurred. I note that in arriving at his decision,
    the trial judge was not assisted by any expert evidence. He prevented the
    appellant’s psychiatrist expert witness from testifying on issues regarding
    procedures in a police or prison setting because the expert had no experience
    in such a setting.  That was a ruling made within the trial judge’s discretion.
    The respondents called no expert evidence to assist the trial judge on these
    issues. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant points out that the evidence disclosed that most of the procedures
    in place in the detention centre were focused on documenting information
    and events or reacting to events as they occurred rather than on taking steps
    to prevent violent incidents once a potential mental illness issue was identified. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree that the record and events of this case have disclosed potential deficiencies
    in the police and detention centre procedures in place at the time for identifying
    and addressing the potential problems posed by a prisoner’s mental illness
    before a violent incident occurs. The evidence was that normally correctional
    staff would engage medical personnel for the psychiatric treatment of a detainee
    only after a violent episode had occurred. With the lens of hindsight, steps
    could have been taken (both by the police and by the detention centre staff)
    that may have prevented the tragic sequence of events that occurred in this
    case, such as sending the appellant for an early assessment, or keeping him
    fully segregated until his condition was fully understood and addressed.
    I earlier raised the desirability of specialized training for officers to
    assist them in dealing as effectively as possible with such prisoners. </p>

line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the end, for the reasons discussed above, I find no error by the trial judge
    that would allow this court to set aside his findings that (1) the respondents
    did not breach their duties of care; and (2) in any event, the damages the
    appellant suffered were not caused by the action or inaction of the respondents. </p>
