  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The trial judge
    granted the appellants’<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a> claim for a declaration that the part
    of the Gilleach Lake Road and the Woodbine Lake Trail that passes through
    the respondents’ property (the “Road”) is an access road to 992275 Ontario
    Inc. (“992275”) within the meaning of the <i>Road Access Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. R.34 (the “Act”). However, he also declared that 992275 is not entitled
    to use the Road for its own purposes, except to enter or leave its property
    in its motor vehicle, and he denied the appellants’ claim for costs. In addition,
    the trial judge denied the respondents’ request for an order under the Act
    closing the Road. Finally, although not referred to in the formal judgment,
    the trial judge stayed the parties’ damage claims pending the disposition
    of an outstanding criminal charge against Axel Winkelmann, the spouse of
    the personal appellant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The appellants
    submit that the trial judge erred in restricting their right to use the Road
    and in denying their claim for costs. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The respondents
    submit that the trial judge erred in declaring that the Road is an access
    road and in directing that the parties’ damage claims be stayed. Further,
    if the Road is an access road, they submit that because there is an unopened
    road allowance adjacent to the northern boundary of the appellants’ land,
    the trial judge erred in proceeding on the basis that s. 2(1) of the Act
    prohibits closing the Road without a court order. Finally, if s. 2(1) of
    the Act prohibits closing the Road without a court order, the respondents
    contend that the trial judge erred in denying their request for an order
    closing the Road.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Given
    the nature of the issues raised and the fact that they are interrelated,
    we will begin with the respondents’ issues and will also address the appellants’ issues
    as they arise.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>II.          Discussion</span></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>            (1) Status of the Road</span></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The respondents
    argued that to qualify as an access road, a road must have been used for
    motor vehicle access by the access seeker with the landowner’s acquiescence
    or consent. They claimed that there was no evidence that they, or their predecessors
    in title, had ever acquiesced or consented to such use of the Road by the
    appellants or their predecessors in title and, in any event, there was no
    evidence of such prior use by the appellants or their predecessors in title. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      We see no error
    in the trial judge’s finding that the Road is an access road within the meaning
    of the Act. In our view, contrary to the respondents’ submissions, the status
    of a road as an access road does not depend on the use of the road by the
    party claiming that the road is an access road. The definition of access
    road set out in s. 1 of the Act<i> </i>requires only that “a road located
    on land not owned by a municipality … serv[e] as a motor vehicle access route
    to one or more parcels of land”<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a>; there is no requirement that a specific
    party use a road in order for it to be an access road.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In this case,
    there was evidence at trial capable of supporting the trial judge’s finding
    that “the Woodbine Trail and the Gilleach Lake Road ‘serve(s) as a motor
    vehicle access route …’ to … the lots owned by the added defendant, Natividade
    (“Nati”) Topp”<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[3]</span></a>. In our view, that finding alone was
    sufficient to justify the conclusion that the Road is an access road within
    the meaning of s. 1 of the Act. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>            <b>(2)            Use of the Road</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      That said, we
    see no statutory basis for declaring that the Road is an access road to or
    for the benefit of particular parties. As already noted, a road meets the
    statutory definition of an access road where it “serves as a motor vehicle
    access route to one or more parcels of land”. While there is a reference
    in the definition to an access road  “serv[ing] one or more parcels of land”,
    there is no reference to an access road serving particular parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>      Similarly,
    we see no statutory basis for imposing conditions either permitting or restricting
    the use of an access road. There is no provision in the Act relating to the
    use that may be made of an access road. Rather, s. 2(1) of the Act prohibits
    impeding access over an access road except in certain circumstances and prescribes
    the conditions under which an access road may be closed. In our view, the
    Act authorizes neither specifying individuals who are entitled to use an
    access road nor imposing conditions permitting or restricting the use of
    the road. See <i><span lang=EN-US>Whitmell v. Ritchie</span></i><span lang=EN-US> (1994),
    20 O.R. (3d) 424 (C.A.) at para. 14, leave to appeal to S.C.C. denied, [1994]
    S.C.C.A. No. 459. However, as we will explain later, a finding that a road
    is an access road establishes only a relatively limited privilege.</span><b><u></u></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>            <b>(3)            Closure of the Road without a Court Order: Section
      2(1)</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    reject the respondents’ submission that the trial judge erred by proceeding
    on the basis that s. 2(1) of the Act prohibits closing the Road without a
    court order. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    2(1) of the Act prohibits closing an access road without a court order where
    closing the access road “prevents all road access to one or more parcels
    of land.” The respondents claim that an unopened road allowance adjacent
    to the northern boundary of the appellants’ property provides viable alternate
    access to the relevant parcels of land. Further, they contend that the trial
    judge erred by failing to apply the test set out in <i>Bogart v.</i> <i>Thompson</i>,
    [2002] O.T.C. 329 (S.C.J.), namely, that in order to trigger the prohibition
    in s. 2(1) of the Act, an access seeker must demonstrate that construction
    of a road on an unopened road allowance is impossible, not just inconvenient
    and expensive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his reasons, the trial judge did not address the issues of what is the appropriate
    test for determining whether the prohibition in s. 2(1) of the Act applies
    and whether the existence of an unopened road allowance is even relevant
    to that question. However, assuming without deciding that the respondents’ position
    on those issues is correct, we are not satisfied that the trial judge made
    any error by proceeding on the basis that s. 2(1) of the Act prohibits closing
    the Road without a court order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, it is implicit in the trial judge’s reasons that he concluded that
    there is a significant amount of water from various sources (beaver dams,
    marshlands, and other large ponds) covering the unopened road allowance.
    On our review of the record, there was evidence capable of supporting that
    conclusion. In <i>Bogart</i>, <i>supra</i>, the trial judge said at para.
    28, “[i]t has been found to be impossible to create road access over water,
    but not over rough ground [footnotes omitted].”
    Accordingly, even applying the <i>Bogart</i> test, we are not persuaded that
    the trial judge erred by proceeding on the basis that the prohibition in
    s. 2(1) of the Act applies in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>            <b>(4)            Closure of the Road by Court Order: Section 3(1)(b)</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    we reach a different conclusion on the issue of whether the trial judge erred
    in denying the respondents’ request for an order closing the Road under s.
    3(1)(b) of the Act. In our view, the trial judge erred by failing to make
    an explicit finding concerning whether the condition set out in that section
    was satisfied, namely, whether any of the parties entitled to notice of the
    application to close the Road have a legal right to use it. As a result of
    that omission, a new trial is required to determine the issue. We reach this
    conclusion for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    3(1)(b) was added to the Act by an amendment that became effective on January
    1, 2003. It provides that a judge may grant a closing order upon being satisfied
    that the persons described in s. 2(3) of the Act (<i>i.e.</i> persons who
    would be deprived of motor vehicle access to and from their land if a road
    closing order was made and who are therefore entitled to notice of an application
    to close an access road) do not have a legal right to use the access road.  Section
    3(1)(b) reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            3.(1)  The
    judge may grant the closing order upon being satisfied that</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            (b)            in
    the case of an access road that is not a common road, persons described in
    subsection 2(3) do not have a legal right to use the road.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the trial judge made no finding concerning whether the persons
    entitled to be served with notice of the application to close the Road have
    a legal right to use it. Rather, at para. 31 of his reasons, he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I find the applicable
    words are “the judge may grant the closing order upon being satisfied…” Counsel
    have not satisfied me that the road should be closed. In my view, the section
    (3) amendment would have direct implications for closing an access road if
    an actual application to subdivide or sever the land was made. In that case,
    it is important for others to be allowed to make their concerns known to
    Municipal authorities in accordance with Municipal rules and regulations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our respectful view, the meaning of the foregoing paragraph is not entirely
    clear. While it is possible that the trial judge may have reached a conclusion
    concerning whether the persons entitled to be served with notice of an application
    to close the Road have a legal right to use it, he did not say what that
    conclusion was and he did not explain the basis for it. As already noted,
    there was evidence at trial of a long history of use of the Road by Nati
    Topp; however, it is far from self-evident whether such use would afford
    her a legal right to use the Road within the meaning of s. 3(1)(b) of the
    Act. On a plain reading of s. 3(1)(b), it was incumbent on the trial judge
    to make a finding on that issue before arriving at any conclusions concerning
    whether the Road should be closed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    if the trial judge concluded that even if the condition in s. 3(1)(b) of
    the Act was satisfied, it would be appropriate to make an order closing the
    Road only in the event of an application to sever or subdivide any of the
    lands served by the Road, we disagree. Assuming without deciding that a judge
    hearing a road closing application retains a residual discretion to refuse
    to close the road where one of the conditions for closing an access road
    set out in s. 3(1) is satisfied, at least in relation to s. 3(1)(b), the
    proper exercise of that discretion would require balancing the competing
    interests of the parties. In our view, a conclusion that an order to close
    the Road should only be made in the limited circumstances referred to by
    the trial judge is patently incorrect either because the trial judge does
    not retain a residual discretion under s. 3(1) to refuse to close an access
    road if one of the conditions in s. 3(1) is met, or because the conclusion
    does not reflect the balancing necessary for the proper exercise of the residual
    discretion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, the trial judge noted that 992275 purchased its land prior to the
    date on which the amendment to the Act that added s. 3(1)(b) came into effect.
    He said at para. 32:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The plaintiffs purchased lot 31 prior to the date
    the amendment came into effect. Maloney J. said in the <i>Township of Shuniah
    v. Richard et al.</i> (1982), 37 O.R. (2d) 471 at p. 477, that:</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE style='text-align:justify;'>On behalf of the plaintiff,
    Mr. Drake submits that s. 37.1(1) is retrospective. He concedes that generally
    legislation ought not to be applied retrospectively and that in fact there
    is a presumption against retrospectivity. He suggests however, that this
    general proposition is altered where there is a claim for an injunction and
    cites as authority the decision of the English Court of Appeal in Application <i>Des
    Gaz S.A. v. Falks Veritas Ltd.</i> (1974), 3 All E.R. 51, where Lord Denning
    M.R. said at pp. 55-56:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>In general, when the law
    is altered during the pendency of an action, the rights of the parties are
    decided according to the law as it existed when the action was begun, unless
    the new statute, on its true intendment, shows an intention to vary such
    rights…</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    these comments indicate that the trial judge concluded that s. 3(1)(b) should
    not be applied in this case as doing so would involve applying the section
    retrospectively, we disagree. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    a plain reading of s. 3(1)(b), while a landowner may apply for a road closing
    order at any time, the date for determining whether the persons entitled
    to notice of the application have a legal right to use the access road can
    be no earlier than the date on which the road closing application is filed.
    Further, to the extent that a legal right to use an access road may arise
    through use and the passage of time, s. 3(1)(b) does not alter the date on
    which the legal right accrues, it does not eliminate rights that have already
    accrued, and it does not change the effect of events that have already occurred.
    Therefore, in our view, applying s. 3(1)(b) of the Act in this case would
    not involve applying the section retrospectively. </p>

    addition, we reject the appellants’ argument, premised on <i>Whitmell v.
    Ritchie</i>, [2003] O.T.C. 413 (S.C.J.), that the trial judge’s finding that
    the Road is an access road should affect our conclusion concerning whether
    the condition in s. 3(1)(b) of the Act was satisfied. In our view, the trial
    judge’s finding that the Road is an access road does not give persons whose
    property is served by the Road a legal right to use it within the meaning
    of s. 3(1)(b). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rather,
    at its highest, the trial judge’s finding that the Road is an access road
    establishes only that parties whose road access to other parcels of land
    would be prevented by an obstruction of the Road are entitled to the privilege
    of not being treated as trespassers: see <i>Deluca v. Paul Guiho Trucking &amp; Construction
    Ltd.</i> (1984), 46 O.R. (2d) 634 (C.A.); and <i>Whitmell v. Ritchie</i> (1994),
    20 O.R. (3d) 424 (C.A.), leave to appeal denied, [1994] S.C.C.A. No. 459.
    These persons are also entitled to the benefit of the legal process stipulated
    in the Act where a landowner wishes to close an access road. To the extent
    that the subsequent decision in <i>Whitmell v. Ritchie</i>, [2003] O.T.C.
    413 (S.C.J.), stands for a proposition that is inconsistent with our conclusions
    as set out in this paragraph, in our view, it is not correct.</p>

    we note that s. 6(1) of the Act provides as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>6. (1) Nothing
    in this Act shall be construed to confer any right in respect of the ownership

    we note that if a finding that a road is an access road created a legal right
    to use the road within the meaning of s. 3(1)(b), the condition in s. 3(1)(b)
    would make no sense. Under s. 3(1)(b), a landowner may apply to close an
    access road if the persons entitled to notice of the application to close
    the access road do not have a legal right to use it. If the fact that the
    road is an access road itself established a legal right to use the access
    road, the condition in s. 3(1)(b) could never be met. </p>

    (both of whom were also counsel at trial) recalls the trial judge asking

    even if the issues in the proceeding below overlap with the issues in the

    a result. The standard of proof in a civil case is different from the standard
    of proof in a criminal proceeding. Accordingly, adverse findings of fact
    in a civil case generally do not create prejudice in a criminal proceeding.
    Finally, to the extent that punitive damages may be awarded in the civil
    action prior to the determination of the criminal proceeding, that is a matter
    that can be taken into account in the criminal proceeding. </p>

    the result, we would allow the appeal, in part, by deleting the words “to
    the owner, 992275 Ontario Inc.” from paragraph 1 of the judgment, and by
    setting aside paragraph 2 of the judgment. In addition, we would allow the
    cross-appeal, in part, by setting aside paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of the judgment
    and by directing a new trial of the issues whether the Road should be closed
    and the damage claims. Further, we would reserve the costs of the original
    trial to the trial judge conducting the new trial. There will be no order
    as to costs of the appeal. Costs of the cross-appeal are to the respondents,
