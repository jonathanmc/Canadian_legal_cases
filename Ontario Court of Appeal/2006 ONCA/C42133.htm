      argued and analyzed at trial, the constitutionality of the seizure of the
      gun and the cocaine turned on whether the police had reasonable and probable
      grounds to arrest the appellant.  The arresting officers acted on information
      supplied by a confidential informant and on their observations of the appellant
      immediately before his arrest.  The informant had provided the police with
      a description of a person, his intended destination and a timeframe within
      which he would be at the specific location.  The informant had also told
      the police that this person was armed and was carrying cocaine.  The police
      took up surveillance at the location described by the informant.  </span></p>

      the police observed the appellant, he matched the generic description provided
      by the informant and was headed towards the named destination within the
      specified timeframe.  More importantly, as the appellant ran across the
      street, he reached into his shirt and appeared to be holding something
      tucked inside his pants. To the experienced officers who observed the appellant,
      it appeared that the appellant was holding a gun tucked into his loose
      pants as he ran across the street.  The officers arrested the appellant
      and in the course of the search pursuant to the arrest, discovered a handgun
      tucked into his pants and cocaine.  </span></p>

      trial judge identified the relevant legal issues and the applicable principles.  She
      referred to the relevant evidence.  Her conclusion that the information
      provided by the informant combined with the observations of the police,
      provided reasonable and probable grounds to arrest is, in our view, unassailable
      both in fact and in law.  In our view, the arrest was lawful and the search
      pursuant to the arrest was, therefore, constitutional.  No issue is taken
      with the manner in which the search was conducted.</span></p>

      trial, the appellant sought further information concerning the confidential
      informant.  The Crown claimed confidential informant privilege and the
      trial judge declined to compel the officers to answer questions that might
      reveal directly or indirectly the identification of the confidential informant.</span></p>

      assertion of informant privilege will shield production of information
      capable of identifying the informant save where an accused can demonstrate
      that the identification is necessary to demonstrate his innocence.  The
      appellant does not make that claim in this case.  Nor in our view did non-disclosure
      prejudice the appellant in his challenge of the constitutionality of the
      arrest and subsequent search.  The information provided by the confidential
      informant was properly treated as the equivalent of information from an
      anonymous, unproven source.  That information, when taken with the officers’ observations
      confirming the information, was enough to justify arrest.  </span></p>

      appellant’s reliance on <i>R. v. Zammit</i> (1993), 81 C.C.C. (3d) 112
      at 121 ignores the crucial distinction between the two cases.  In <i>Zammit</i>,
      the police surveillance revealed nothing that tended to confirm the material
      parts of the informant’s tip.  Here, as indicated above, the observations
      of the appellant as he ran across the street provided significant confirmation
      of the informant’s statement that the appellant was armed.</span></p>
