  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Leah
    and Ron Ristimaki were married in 1960.  Mr. Ristimaki became a very successful
    businessman as a result of his 51 per cent ownership of Auto-Trans Holdings
    Ltd. (“ATH”).  ATH, through a subsidiary, was the largest transporter of
    cars in Canada.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    and Mrs. Ristimaki enjoyed an extravagant lifestyle.  Although they had a
    rented house in Oakville, Ontario they lived for the most part on a 5-acre
    property in Florida that was jointly owned through a corporate structure.  They
    also spent considerable time on their 55-foot yacht cruising in the Caribbean
    and engaging in sport fishing tournaments.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 7, 1993, while he was about to leave their Florida home to travel
    to Ontario, Mr. Ristimaki advised his wife that he was leaving her and terminating
    their 33-year marriage.  This news came without any warning.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    March 1994, Mrs. Ristimaki retained Gregory Cooper, a Toronto lawyer who
    specialized in family law.  It is agreed between the parties that from the
    time of the first meeting between Mrs. Ristimaki and Mr. Cooper, Mrs. Ristimaki
    warned her lawyer that her husband was planning to sell his business, retire
    and leave Canada.  It is also agreed that Mrs. Ristimaki told Mr. Cooper
    that her husband was in the habit of selling used equipment for cash, which
    he deposited offshore in the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
    virtually the outset and on many occasions, Mrs. Ristimaki also told Mr.
    Cooper that her husband was intending to pay her as little as possible and
    to disappear.  Mr. Cooper always reassured Mrs. Ristimaki and told her not
    to worry, as she would have so much money that she would be able to buy whatever
    she wanted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Ristimaki retained Tom Bastedo, also a family law specialist.  Mr. Cooper
    and Mr. Bastedo knew each other well, as they had been law partners until
    1991, together with Frank Shostack, a commercial lawyer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    April 1994, Mr. Cooper requested that Mr. Bastedo provide him with Mr. Ristimaki’s
    financial statement.  By mid-June, Mr. Cooper had not received Mr. Ristimaki’s
    financial statement.  On June 17, 1994, he threatened proceedings.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    July 11, 1994, the sale of ATH was announced.  The purchaser was Allied Holdings
    Inc. of Atlanta, Georgia.  A few days before the public announcement, Mr.
    Ristimaki advised his wife of the sale.  Only a few weeks earlier, he had
    told Mrs. Ristimaki that his shares were worthless. On July 26, 1994, Mr.
    Bastedo produced an unsworn financial statement of Mr. Ristimaki that valued
    Mr. Ristimaki’s interest in ATH at $12,750,000 as of separation (November
    7, 1993 –
    “the valuation date” ).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    early August, Mr. Cooper prepared a petition for divorce.  The petition also
    claimed an equalization of net family property under the <i>Family Law Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;F. 3, an accounting of Mr. Ristimaki’s business interest
    and an interim order for the preservation and non-dissipation of Mr. Ristimaki’s
    property pending trial pursuant to s. 12 of the <i>Family Law Act</i>.  Mr.
    Cooper devised a two-step litigation strategy.  The first step was a motion
    for particulars of the sale of ATH.  After the receipt of the particulars,
    the second step in the strategy was to bring a motion for interim preservation
    of the sale proceeds from the ATH sale.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    August 16, 1994, Mr. Cooper served the divorce petition together with a notice
    of motion in which he sought the particulars of the ATH sale.  The motion
    was adjourned on two occasions and was ultimately returnable on September
    27, 2004.  Mrs. Ristimaki filed an affidavit in support of the motion in
    which she deposed:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[Mr. Ristimaki] has been saying
      for several years that he wished to sell his interest in [ATH]. I believe
      that he will retire upon the closing of the sale to Allied. Once that occurs,
      [Mr. Ristimaki] will have no reason to remain in Ontario, and I do not
      believe that he will. It is therefore urgent that my solicitors be advised
      forthwith of the particulars of the payments to [Mr. Ristimaki] for his
      interest in [ATH], so that they may then take steps to protect my position
      by seeking reasonable security to protect my entitlement to the equalization
      payment which will be found to be owing to me by [Mr. Ristimaki].  </span>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Cooper retained a business valuator, Wayne Rudson, to assist in the appraisal
    of Mr. Ristimaki’s shares in ATH.  In a letter to Mr. Rudson, Mr. Cooper
    described Mr. Ristimaki as a flight risk who had already bought a house in
    Sarasota, Florida.  Mr. Cooper advised Mr. Rudson that Mr. Ristimaki spent
    a lot of time in the Caribbean and along the coast of Mexico, which would
    make it difficult to enforce a judgment against him.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    preparation for the disclosure motion, Mr. Cooper made the following file
    note:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[…] obvious that value of that int. in Auto-Trans
    is most signif. factor affecting [Ron]’s NFP […], when sale announced, I
    frankly cons’d prob. solved […], there’s no evidence of any intervening event
    between 11/93 and 7/94 which would significantly affect value […], <b><i>once
    sale</i> <i>closes, H. is gone - he’s already bought a house in Fla…… I need…to
    protect my cl’s EP. </i></b> […] I don’t know if Mr. R.’s sh’s—are being
    bought for cash, for part cash, part shares of Allied; whether he’s being
    pd. on closing, or over a period of years, whether the money is to be paid
    here or the Cayman Islands (<i>where he already has 415K</i>)…<b><i>he could
    have the $ pd offshore, step onto his boat &amp; enforcement wld be virtually
    impossible.</i></b> [emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the day before the disclosure motion was to be argued, Mr. Rudson advised
    Mr. Cooper that he estimated the equalization payment owed to Mrs. Ristimaki
    was $8,000,000 on the assumption that ATH was worth $45,000,000.  Ignoring
    the yacht, Mr. Rudson assumed that the house in Florida was worth $2,000,000
    and that Mr. Ristimaki’s half interest would go to his wife.  In order to
    ensure that the equalization payment of $8,000,000 would be made, it would
    be necessary to secure $7,000,000.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later
    the same day, as a result of a proposal made by Mr. Bastedo and on the recommendation
    of Mr. Cooper, the motion was settled on the following terms which were confirmed
    in writing on September 27:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Ristimaki would pay $2,500,000 to Mrs. Ristimaki out of the proceeds of the
    sale to Allied as an advance on her equalization payment;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Ristimaki would place a further $1,500,000 out of the sale proceeds into
    trust to await the outcome of the proceedings between the parties;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Ristimaki would transfer his interest in the Florida property to Mrs. Ristimaki;
    and,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mrs.
    Ristimaki would not bring any motion to have further of Mr. Ristimaki’s monies
    secured prior to judgment.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>Prior to the settlement Mr. Cooper
    did not tell Mrs. Ristimaki about Mr. Rudson’s recommendation concerning
    the required security for the equalization payment, the need for a preservation
    order in respect of other monies at risk of leaving the jurisdiction, and
    the fact that, under the terms of the settlement, she would be giving up
    any further claim for security prior to judgment at trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    November 1994, the sale of ATH was completed.  The sale price was $41,000,000.  However,
    in Mr. Ristimaki’s sworn financial statement delivered shortly after the
    settlement, he stated that the total value of the shares was $25,000,000
    as of the valuation date.  Mr. Ristimaki, through his counsel, took the position
    that the value of the shares at the date of the sale was irrelevant.  Some
    evidence at trial suggested that the sale negotiations began before the valuation
    date, which led to speculation by Mr. Cooper that the price at the outset
    may have been in the range of what was eventually agreed upon for the sale.  However,
    Mr. Ristimaki told Mr. Rudson at a meeting that the first contact with Allied
    was in February 1994. It should be noted that no documents on this issue
    were ever produced, and no discovery of Mr. Ristimaki was ever conducted,
    so that the record on this issue is unsatisfactory. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    settlement of the motion was completed in November 1994. After the settlement,
    Mr. Ristimaki phoned his wife and told her that he had placed his money offshore
    and that she should do the same.  Mrs. Ristimaki advised Mr. Cooper of this
    information but he did nothing in response.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Cooper brought a motion for interim support in May 1995 before Lissaman J.
    of the Superior Court of Justice.  During the argument of that motion, Mr.
    Cooper and Mr. Bastedo agreed that the trial should take place by January
    26, 1996.  As a result, the order of Lissaman J. provided for interim support
    from April 1, 1995 through January 30, 1996.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Cooper did not advance the case to trial by January 1996.  In April 1996,
    he moved to continue the interim support order before Beaulieu J. of the
    Superior Court of Justice.  Beaulieu J. granted the request but included
    the following term:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The parties shall seek an early pre-trial and expedited
    trial from the Family Law Office, with the assistance of a judge as regards
    time table if necessary.  </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>When Mr. Cooper’s clerk drafted
    the order of Beaulieu J. she deliberately omitted the above term.  In a memo
    to Mr. Cooper she said, “I figured that we could omit this and see if [Mr.
    Bastedo] adds it.”  Mr. Cooper accepted the omission and Mr. Bastedo approved
    the draft order.  In his evidence at trial, Mr. Cooper explained that he
    left out the term in Beaulieu J.’s. order because Mr. Ristimaki was annoyed
    with having to pay interim support, and the longer he had to do so, the more
    agreeable he was likely to be on a final settlement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Except
    for the two support motions, no steps were taken between October 1994 and
    June 1996 to move the litigation forward.  During this period, some advice
    was given to Mrs. Ristimaki concerning her financial affairs and she was
    assisted in ancillary issues related to the separation.  By the end of June
    1996, Mr. Cooper had been on the file for more than two years and three months.  As
    of that time, there had been no formal examination for discovery conducted
    and no affidavit of documents received.  No steps had been taken to move
    the case to trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    June 20, 1996, Mr. Shostack, a former partner of Mr. Cooper, met with Mr.
    Cooper.  Mr. Shostack was Mr. Ristimaki’s commercial lawyer.  At the meeting,
    he provided Mr. Cooper with a memo on the understanding that Mr. Cooper would
    show it to no one.  The memo was titled, “Hypothetical Fact Situation for
    Discussion – Confidential and Without Prejudice.”  The memo read:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am advising Mr. X on certain commercial matters
    relating to his matrimonial proceeding with his former spouse.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[…]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mr. X owes a large amount of tax arrears – The
    amount of the liability exceeds the amount of the cash payment to Mrs. X
    and the amount of the funds in trust.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Mr. X moved out of the country and has all of
      his assets owned through offshore trusts and companies</i>.  He owns very
      little in his own name.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>The tax department has been attempting to contact
      Mr. X and has recently learned about Mr. X’s matrimonial dispute.  They
      are aware that a large amount of funds were paid to Mr. X’s lawyer, but
      have not yet contacted such lawyers to inquire if those funds are still
      held by such lawyers.  Mr. X expects the tax department to seize the trust
      fund very shortly</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[…]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Here is my problem:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mr. X instructed me to do nothing and allow the
    tax department to seize the trust monies.  He doubted whether discussing
    this problem with Mrs. X’s lawyer would resolve anything.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I disagreed for two reasons.  Firstly, <i>I believe
      that Mrs. X’s lawyer would be interested in protecting Mrs. X’s property</i>.  Secondly,
      I have known Mrs. X’s lawyer for a long time and felt an obligation to
      make him aware of this problem.  Moreover I believed that this lawyer has
      known me long enough to know that I would not make up a false story to
      try to extract a settlement.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mr. X agreed to allow me to speak with Mrs. X’s
    lawyer to offer settling on a division of the monies in Mr. X’s lawyer’s
    trust account by paying Mrs. X $500,000.  Mr. X intends to use the remainder
    as part of a settlement on his tax liability [emphasis added].  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the following day, Mr. Cooper and Mr. Rudson flew to Florida to meet with
    Mrs. Ristimaki.  She instructed Mr. Cooper to reject the $500,000 offer referred
    to in the above memo, but advised him to make a counter offer for $1,000,000.  Mr.
    Cooper advised Mr. Shostack of the counter offer but there was never any

    January 8, 1997, Revenue Canada filed a certificate in the amount of $7,444,261
    in the Federal Court against Mr. Ristimaki.  The amount on the certificate
    represented unpaid taxes, penalties and interest for the 1994 taxation year.  This
    certificate has the effect of a judgment.  On the same day, Revenue Canada
    filed a writ of execution with the sheriff in Toronto.  The Crown thus became
    both a judgment creditor and an execution creditor of Mr. Ristimaki.  From
    that point, its claim had priority over the claims of other judgment and
    execution creditors pursuant to the Crown prerogative.</p>

    Canada then claimed against the $1.5 million in the Bastedo trust account.  Mrs.
    Ristimaki contested Revenue Canada’s claim.  However, Low J. of the Superior
    Court of Justice ruled in favour of Revenue Canada on January 8, 2000.  Mrs.
    Ristimaki appealed.   Before the argument of the appeal in December 2000,
    Mrs. Ristimaki settled with Revenue Canada for 30 percent of the funds in
    the Bastedo trust account, which amounted to $493,512.68.  </p>

    on September 30, 1998, Mr. Cooper, acting as agent for Mrs. Ristimaki’s new
    counsel (she had terminated Mr. Cooper’s retainer in June 1998), obtained
    default judgement from Beaulieu J. for the balance of the equalization payment.  The
    amount of the default judgment was $4,437,638 plus prejudgment interest of
    $1,646,622, totalling $6,084,260.  By this time, Mr. Ristimaki had taken
    flight (apparently to Costa Rica) and his pleadings had been struck.  The
    default judgment remains unpaid.  Thus, the fear that Mrs. Ristimaki had
    expressed from the first day she met Mr. Cooper was realized.</p>

    was delivered on June 23, 2004.  The trial judge found that Mr. Cooper was
    negligent in a number of respects.  However, he found that Mr. Cooper’s negligence

      period one, the trial judge considered three allegations of negligence.  The
      first allegation was that Mr. Cooper fell below the standard of care in
      failing to advise Mrs. Ristimaki about an interim preservation order and
      failing to seek such an order in his initial motion, rather than adopting
      a two-step procedure.  The trial judge rejected this allegation and concluded

      of his judgment:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New Roman"'>[I]n
      failing to inform Mrs. Ristimaki about Mr. Rudson's estimate regarding

      assuming in agreeing to the settlement, and in failing to obtain her concurrence
      to the &quot;no further motion for security&quot; term of the deal, Mr.

      related allegation of negligence was advanced by counsel for Mrs. Ristimaki,
      to the effect that Mr. Cooper had settled the disclosure motion “in the
      dark”. This allegation was supported by expert evidence from Mr. Niman,
      a specialist in family law. The trial judge rejected this allegation at
      para. 136 of his reasons for judgment:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I therefore do not accept Mr. Niman's premise that
    Mr.&nbsp;Cooper settled the motion &quot;in the dark&quot;. Mr.&nbsp;Cooper
    had some information, albeit not obtained directly from Mr.&nbsp;Ristimaki
    under oath, upon which to base a judgment concerning the potential for a
    larger equalization payment in favour of the plaintiff. Since I do not accept
    the premise upon which Mr. Niman's criticism was based, I do not agree that
    Mr.&nbsp;Cooper fell below the standard in this regard.</p>

      respect of Mr. Cooper’s recommendation to accept the settlement proposal,
      the trial judge concluded the following at para 137:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In reaching the foregoing conclusions I am conscious
    of the comments of Anderson J. in <i>Karpenko v. Paroian, Courey, Cohen &amp; Houston</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    that &quot;it would only be in the case of some egregious error … that negligence
    would be found&quot; in connection with a lawyer's recommendation to a client
    to settle. My finding of negligence is not based upon the recommendation
    Mr.&nbsp;Cooper made to his client, or his decision to recommend the settlement
    notwithstanding he had not obtained disclosure. Plainly, the price of obtaining
    disclosure would have been the withdrawal of the offer that was in hand.
    The decision to recommend the settlement was a judgment by counsel based
    on the available information, and weighing the options. Mr.&nbsp;Cooper had
    received Mr.&nbsp;Rudson's estimate as to the amount that needed to be put
    into trust, was aware of the risks of declining the settlement and proceeding
    with the motions, and concluded that the settlement was worth recommending
    to his client. I am not prepared to find that, in making this decision, Mr.&nbsp;Cooper
    made an &quot;egregious error&quot;. Rather, his breach of duty consisted
    of failing to provide all material information to the client when seeking
    his client's settlement instructions.</p>

      pause here to underline the comment of the trial judge that, “[P]lainly
      the price of obtaining disclosure would have been the withdrawal of the
      offer that was in hand.”  While that may be so, the prospect of a subsequent
      and better offer had Mr. Cooper pressed on with his two-step strategy does
      not appear to have been considered.  I shall return to this subject later.</span></p>

      Cooper fell below the standard of care in agreeing to the terms of the
      payment of the $1,500,000 into Mr. Bastedo’s trust account.  The trial
      judge rejected this allegation and concluded that it was a standard arrangement

      the burden of satisfying the court, on a balance of probabilities, that
      she would have acted differently had she been properly advised”.  <span lang=EN-US>He

    trial judge found that Mrs. Ristimaki never testified that she would have
    refused the settlement if she had been properly advised by Mr. Cooper.  The
    trial judge observed that the closest she came to giving such evidence was
    in reference to the settlement correspondence when she said that she did
    not like the “no further motion for security” term because her husband was
    a flight risk.  Nevertheless, the trial judge concluded that Mrs. Ristimaki
    had not discharged her burden to satisfy the court that she would have acted
    differently, if she had been properly advised.  </p>

    the trial judge’s conclusion that there was no causal connection between
    Mr. Cooper’s negligence in the first period and the loss claimed by Mrs.
    Ristimaki, the trial judge proceeded with an assessment of damages in respect
    of the first period.  He did so on a “lost chance” theory of damages.</p>

lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge concluded that there was a reasonable probability that Mr. Cooper
    would have obtained a s.12 preservation order in the amount of $7,000,000
    and that the risk of non-payment into court was relatively low.  However,
    in the trial judge’s view, Mr. Ristimaki would still have defaulted on his
    tax bill and the related amounts owing to Revenue Canada.  He concluded that
    the funds paid into court would have been subject to seizure by Revenue Canada.  </p>

lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge then considered whether Mrs. Ristimaki would have been able to
    obtain a final judgment for her equalization claim prior to Revenue Canada
    seizing the funds.  In this regard, he concluded that the litigation would
    have been hard-fought and protracted.  He also said that it was very possible
    that Mr. Ristimaki would appeal a favourable judgment for Mrs. Ristimaki.  </p>

lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge concluded that there was a high likelihood that the $7,000,000
    would have remained in court as of January 8, 1997, and thus would have been
    seized by Revenue Canada.  In the result, the failure to obtain a preservation
    order did not cause any damages.  Simply put, Mrs. Ristimaki failed to prove
    that the chance she lost had any value.  </p>

lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge then continued his assessment of damages on the assumption that
    Revenue Canada did not seize the funds in court.  He asked himself the question:
    would Mr. Ristimaki continue to contest the equalization claim and, if so,
    what would the result have been?</p>

lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge reasoned that Mr. Ristimaki would probably have contested his
    wife’s equalization claim if he had been required to pay $7,000,000 into
    court.  The trial judge also concluded that Mr. Ristimaki would have argued
    for a valuation of the ATH shares at a much lower level than the post valuation
    date sale price of $41,000,000.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge then considered whether the court was bound by the judgment granted
    on default by Beaulieu J. on September 30, 1998, concerning Mrs. Ristimaki’s
    entitlement to an equalization payment.  The trial judge concluded that he
    was not bound by the prior judgment and that neither the doctrine of abuse
    of process nor the rule against collateral attack prevented him from arriving
    at a different result.</p>

      for Mr. Cooper at trial called an accountant who prepared an estimate of
      Mrs. Ristimaki’s equalization payment, based on a value of the ATH shares
      of $25,000,000.  From that figure, he calculated an equalization payment
      owing to Mrs. Ristimaki of $4,586,252, which the trial judge rounded off
      to $4,600,000.  </span></p>

      this figure was reduced by amounts previously received:  $2,500,000 in
      cash and one-half the value of the Florida property ($800,000) received
      in the settlement of the disclosure motion and a net recovery from Revenue
      Canada of $322,629.89.  In the result, the trial judge fixed Mrs. Ristimaki’s

    were motions and threatened motions to strike Mr.&nbsp;Ristimaki's pleading
    in order to collect Mrs.&nbsp;Ristimaki's support payments, nothing was actually
    done to advance her equalization claim until one of the motions to strike

      trial judge’s use of the time grid as an aid to his review of the evidence,
      I am of the opinion that his reliance on the time grid analysis led him
      to fall into reversible error.  In view of these errors, a new trial is
      required.  Having concluded that there should be a new trial, it is neither
      helpful nor necessary to decide the other three issues raised by the appellant.  </span></p>

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(i) Standard of care</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for Mrs. Ristimaki acknowledged that the trial judge correctly articulated
    the following principles in respect of the standard of care of a lawyer: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) A solicitor must bring reasonable care, skill
    and know-ledge to the professional service which he or she has undertaken;
    see <i>Central Trust Co. v. Rafuse</i>, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 147 at 208; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) For a solicitor who holds himself or herself
    out as having particular expertise in a given area of the law, a higher standard
    of care applies; see <i>Confederation Life Insurance Co. v. Shepherd McKenzie,
    Plaxton, Little and Jenkins</i> (1992), 29 R.P.R. (2nd) 271 (Ont. Ct. Gen.
    Div), varied on other grounds (1996), 88 O.A.C. 398 (C.A.); and,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c) A lawyer who does not adequately or diligently
    protect the client’s interests will be found negligent: see Stephen M. Grant
    and Linda R. Rothstein, <i>Lawyers’
    Professional</i> <i>Liability</i>, 2<span style='font-family:&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>nd </span>ed. (Markham: Butterworths, 1998) at 23. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    counsel for Mrs. Ristimaki accepted that the trial judge’s articulation of
    the above principles was correct, he further submits that the trial judge
    erred in applying the “egregious error” test to Mr. Cooper’s recommendation
    to settle the disclosure motion.  As already mentioned in para. 31 of these
    reasons, the trial judge relied upon the judgment of Anderson J. in <i>Karpenko
    v.</i> <i>Paroian, Courey, Cohen &amp; Houston </i>(1980), 30 O.R. (2d) 776
    (H.C.J.). In that case, Anderson J. observed at p. 790 that, “it would only
    be in a clear and exceptional case that the decision of counsel to recommend
    settlement could be successfully assailed.” Anderson J. further observed
    at p. 791 that, in order to establish negligence against a lawyer in respect
    of his or her advice concerning the settlement of a case, proof of an egregious
    error is required. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately,
    at the time that the trial judge delivered his judgment in this case, he
    did not have the benefit of this court’s decision in <i>Folland v. Reardon</i>,
    (2005) 74 O.R. (3d) 688 (C.A), which had not yet been argued in this court.
    In <i>Folland v. Reardon</i>, the court held that there is no justification
    for holding lawyers to a different and lower standard than other professionals.
    Doherty J.A., speaking for the court, said at paras. 41 and 42: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I see no justification for departing from the reasonableness
    standard. That standard has proven to be sufficiently flexible and fact-sensitive
    to be effectively applied to a myriad of situations in which allegations
    of negligence arise out of the delicate exercise of judgment by professionals.
    Without diminishing the difficulty of many judgments that counsel must make
    in the course of litigation, the judgment calls made by lawyers are no more
    difficult than those made by other professionals. The decisions of other
    professionals are routinely subjected to a reasonableness standard in negligence
    lawsuits. I see no reason why lawyers should not be subjected to the same
    standard: <i>Major v. Buchanan</i> (1975), 9 O.R. (2nd) 491 at 510 (H.C.)</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Recognition that some decisions made by lawyers
    are subject to a different standard than the reasonableness standard would
    also require courts to decide whether the impugned conduct of the lawyer
    fell under the rubric of “barrister’s work” or was properly described as “solicitor’s
    work.” This distinction would be difficult to make in some situations. Sometimes,
    the alleged negligent conduct by the lawyer will encompass both kinds of
    work.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    necessarily follows that the trial judge erred in his application of the “egregious
    error test”.  The question then arises whether Mr. Cooper’s advice to settle
    the disclosure motion at the time, and on the terms proposed by Mr. Bastedo,
    met the standard of reasonableness.  In considering this question, it seems
    to me that the following factors come into play:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)        Mr. Cooper, on behalf of Mrs. Ristimaki,
    was only six weeks into the litigation;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)       Mr. Cooper had not yet received a sworn
    financial statement from counsel for Mr. Ristimaki;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii)     Mr. Cooper had not received an affidavit
    of documents from counsel for Mr. Ristimaki;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iv)      No examination for discovery of Mr. Ristimaki
    had been held;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(v)       No preservation order under s. 12 of
    the <i>Family</i> <i>Law Act</i> had been obtained or moved for;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(vi)      The offer of September 26, 1994 was the
    first offer, or first significant offer – it would, I suggest, be unusual
    for this offer to be the last;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(vii)     Mr. Gerald Sadvari, one of Mrs. Ristimaki’s
    experts, testified that had Mr. Cooper proceeded with a preservation motion,
    it would have produced a better settlement or the result of the motion would
    have been better: He also said that a preservation motion would have strengthened
    Mr. Cooper’s bargaining position;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(viii)    Mr. Ristimaki was sitting on an agreement
    for the purchase of his shares in ATH, which was scheduled to close later
    in the fall and which was very favourable to him – several million dollars
    more than his earlier valuation. Thus, Mr. Ristimaki’s “appetite” for settlement
    with his wife needed to be assessed, as well as the extent to which proceeding
    with the Cooper two-step strategy potentially could have put the ATH sale
    in jeopardy, thereby increasing the likelihood of Mr. Ristimaki’s making
    a subsequent and better offer; and,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ix)      Had the sale been concluded, the prospects
    of obtaining a court order requiring payment of the sale proceeds or a significant
    portion thereof into court pursuant to a preservation order was also a potential
    factor for consideration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the trial judge considered some of the above factors in other parts of his
    reasons, he does not appear to have considered them in respect of Mr. Cooper’s
    recommendation for settlement of the motion. Nowhere does he consider the
    early stage of the litigation and the prospect that a rejection of the September
    26 offer might have produced a subsequent and better offer.  As I have said,
    the trial judge observed that, “[P]lainly, the price of obtaining disclosure
    would have been the withdrawal of the offer that was in hand.” While that
    is so, the trial judge’s view appears to have been that this was an “all
    or nothing” situation –
    either Mrs. Ristimaki accepted the offer of September 26 or she proceeded
    with the litigation to the bitter end. With respect, I disagree.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    fairness to the trial judge, while the position set out in the above paragraph
    was vigorously pursued in oral argument before this court, the record reveals
    that it was not argued before the trial judge.  Nonetheless, the point is
    an important one and there was some evidence before the trial judge on the
    issue. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    view of the trial judge’s application of the egregious error standard to
    the assessment of Mr. Cooper’s conduct in recommending the settlement of
    the disclosure motion, the next question is whether this court should apply
    the reasonableness standard to the recommendation of Mr. Cooper.  In my opinion,
    on this record, this court is not in a position to do so.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    difference between the standard of reasonableness and the standard of egregious
    error is significant. In my view, this issue is central to the case against
    Mr. Cooper.  It should be determined in the context of a trial in which the
    trial judge would take into account the above factors and any other relevant
    factors that the court considers appropriate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is an additional reason for declining to conclude that this court should
    determine the issue.  If the conclusion should be that Mr. Cooper fell below
    the standard of reasonableness in recommending the settlement, it follows
    that a reasonably competent lawyer would have recommended against accepting
    the proposed settlement.  On the record before us, it appears likely that
    Mrs. Ristimaki would have accepted that advice. What then must follow is
    a causation analysis and an assessment of damages, which would take into
    account some of the same factors that would go into the standard of reasonableness
    analysis. These matters are also best left to a trial judge. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(ii) Did the trial judge err
      in his reliance on the time grid?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for Mrs. Ristimaki submits that Mr. Cooper’s inaction was sustained over
    years and that to analyze his conduct by means of the time grid produced
    a fictitious result.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for Mrs. Ristimaki further submits that Mr. Cooper did not make three separate
    decisions to delay his prosecution of the action. The alleged delay constitutes
    one sustained act of neglect and the trial judge should have considered the
    totality of Mr. Cooper’s actions and inactions, instead of proceeding to
    dissect his conduct within three precise time periods.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel’s
    argument is summarized as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>From March 1994 to June 1998, Cooper took no steps
    to preserve [Mr. Ristimaki’s] assets for [Mrs. Ristimaki’s] benefit.  He
    sought no discovery or other examination of [Mr. Ristimaki]. He did nothing
    to bring the case to trial, letting the original January 1996 target date
    pass by. When [Mrs. Ristimaki] finally obtained default judgment, Cooper’s
    retainer had been terminated, and there were no assets remaining to satisfy
    it, because of his inaction. The time grid distorts this.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The distortion is achieved by reductionism, i.e.
    by creating three time periods in which Cooper’s acts are isolated and not
    related. In truth, there was only one time period, in which all of his acts
    were related. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The time grid was not the case [Mrs. Ristimaki]
    put to the court. The case was the sustained, linear negligence of Cooper.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>By embarking on the grid-driven analysis, the [trial
    judge] denied [Mrs. Ristimaki] an adjudication on the case she was putting
    forward.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It was either an error of law, or of mixed fact
    and law, for [the trial judge] to have applied the grid. Without the grid,
    the causal link between [Mrs. Ristimaki’s] loss and Cooper’s negligence is
    patent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I
    am not persuaded that the use of the time grid and the analysis of the three
    separate periods are in themselves reasons to find error with the approach
    of the trial judge. This was a complex case in which the trial judge was
    required to conduct a detailed review of a lawyer’s conduct of his representation
    of a client over more than four years.  It is clear that the trial judge
    found it useful to proceed in a chronological fashion by looking at Mr. Cooper’s
    conduct within specific time frames.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    I agree with counsel for Mrs. Ristimaki that it was necessary to consider
    Mr. Cooper’s conduct as a whole, rather than solely in segmented time compartments,
    when determining whether his conduct fell below the requisite standard of
    care.  In my view, once the trial judge had conducted his time grid analysis,
    he should have stepped back and considered whether the failure to move the
    case to trial, at least prior to the action taken by Revenue Canada and in
    accordance with Mr. Cooper’s own agreement with Mr. Bastedo as found by the
    trial judge and as further directed by Beaulieu J. in April 1996, fell the
    below the requisite standard of care. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is a case that, to the knowledge of Mr. Cooper, needed to be moved to trial
    on an urgent basis.  Mr. Cooper was fixed with the knowledge from the outset
    of his retainer that Mr. Ristimaki was a flight risk.  Knowing that, absent
    a settlement, the only certain way of securing Mrs. Ristimaki’s lawful entitlement
    was to get her case decided by a trial judge. A settlement of a family law
    dispute is clearly the optimal result; however, often the only way to achieve
    a settlement is to force the recalcitrant party to the courtroom door.  To
    a large degree, this was demonstrated in this case by the fact that Mr. Ristimaki
    proposed a settlement late in the day before the disclosure motion was to
    be argued. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Cooper and Mr. Bastedo agreed in May 1995 that this case should be tried
    by January 26, 1996. Yet no steps were taken to achieve that specific objective
    and no clear explanation for the failure to do so is evident on the record.  In
    the trial judge’s analysis of the second period time grid, he lists a number
    of activities undertaken by Mr. Cooper and Mr. Rudson on Mrs. Ristimaki’s
    behalf including: completing the details of the transfer of the Florida property;
    obtaining informal discovery; bringing motions for interim spousal support;
    providing financial, investment and tax advice; advising in respect of Mrs.
    Ristimaki’s right to her husband’s pension; and obtaining a divorce judgment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded his analysis of the second period of the time grid
    in paras. 249-252 of his reasons as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The standard to which a lawyer is held is one of
    reasonable diligence. What is reasonable will vary depending upon the circumstances
    of a particular case, taking into account the client’s goals, the means available
    to attain those goals and strategic considerations regarding the best approach
    to take. As Mr. Niman observed, “it is not necessarily a question of every
    case proceeding quickly.” The vast majority of cases do not reach trial.
    Very often, compromises are reached and settlements achieved without pursuing
    all available formal litigation options. Counsel may determine that there
    are advantages to be gained by pursuing a more informal approach and seeking
    to resolve a dispute by agreement, [rather than] resorting to formal procedures
    where agreement cannot be reached. Indeed, from a policy perspective, informal
    resolution of disputes is to be preferred over formal court proceedings,
    provided the clients’ interests are protected and their rights are not compromised.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Having said this, I am unable to find that the
    defendant’s approach to the prosecution of the Ristimaki matrimonial litigation
    in the period between September 1994 and June 1996 was substandard. Rather,
    Mr. Cooper’s conduct of the case over this period was consistent with the
    foregoing principles. Having obtained a substantial up-front cash payment
    on account of Mrs. Ristimaki’s equalization claim entitlement, a further
    $1,500,000 in trust, as well as an agreement for the transfer of full ownership
    of the Florida house, Mr. Cooper adopted an approach designed to elicit informally
    the information that he needed to assess his client’s potential recovery
    and Mr. Ristimaki’s likely response to her claim. He obtained an order for
    interim support. He addressed the division of Mr. Ristimaki’s pension, tax
    issues associated with the interim settlement and the transfer of his house.
    Having informally determined his client’s best case, he sought her instructions
    regarding settlement and attempted to negotiate a final resolution with Mr.
    Bastedo. When that approach did not accomplish the desired result, he resorted
    to the more formal process, demanding delivery of a sworn affidavit of documents.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It was not foreseeable that the failure of Mr.
    Cooper to advance Mrs. Ristimaki’s case through discovery and to trial by
    [January] 1996 (or, for that matter, by January 1997) would have put the
    $1,500,000 at risk. Simply stated, it could not have been anticipated that
    Mr. Ristimaki would violate Canadian tax law as he did. Where a risk cannot
    reasonably be anticipated, a person cannot be held liable for failing to
    take steps to guard against it. “A defendant need only pay attention to what
    is probable not what is possible”: G.H.L. Fridman, <i>The Law of Torts in
    Canada</i>, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 2002) at 389, citing <i>Ouellet
    v. Cloutier</i>, [1947] S.C.R. 521 at 526, per Taschereau J. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>When viewed without the benefit of hindsight, having
    regard to the various steps that he took to advance Mrs. Ristimaki’s interests,
    Mr. Cooper’s approach during Period II was appropriate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    above analysis fails to recognize the significance of the agreement between
    Mr. Bastedo and Mr. Cooper.  Two senior family law specialists agreed in
    the spring of 1995 to conduct the trial before January 26, 1996.  Settlement
    discussion is something which pervades, and should pervade, almost every
    lawsuit. However, given the circumstances, I see no reason why settlement
    discussions and the other activities listed by the trial judge should have
    delayed the case moving to trial. Those activities could and should have
    been carried out while advancing the case to trial. In order to accomplish
    this, Mr. Cooper needed full document production, including production of
    documents related to the ATH sale, and an examination for discovery of Mr.
    Ristimaki. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is worth noting here that Mr. Sadvari testified that the Family Law Division
    was and remains very efficient with respect to giving dates for trials.  It
    was his opinion, that even though there was a lot of work to do, that there
    would have been no problem getting the case to trial by the end of January
    1996.  Mr. Sadvari at that time was both a member of the Bench and Bar Committee
    and Chair of the Family Law Section of the Canadian Bar Association of Ontario.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge held that, if Mr. Ristimaki had been required to pay $7,000,000
    into court as part of a court-ordered preservation order, there was good
    reason to believe that the litigation over Mrs. Ristimaki’s equalization
    claim would have been hard fought and protracted.  He also observed that,
    in these circumstances, there was a high likelihood that the litigation would
    have taken considerable time to reach trial and that it was very possible
    that a trial judgment favourable to Mrs. Ristimaki would have been appealed
    by her husband.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later
    in his reasons, in the context of his second period time grid analysis, the
    trial judge concluded that even with the April 1996 order for an early pre-trial
    and expedited trial date, it was likely that Mrs. Ristimaki would not have
    been able to collect any funds from her husband before Revenue Canada asserted
    its claim.  The trial judge reasoned that Mr. Ristimaki could have controlled
    the timing of both the matrimonial litigation and Revenue Canada’s pursuit
    of its claim, by seeking to ensure that his funds went to Revenue Canada
    before they were recovered by Mrs. Ristimaki.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nowhere
    in his reasons, however, does the trial judge consider the likely course
    and pace of the matrimonial litigation had the settlement of the disclosure
    motion and a trial by January 26, 1996 both gone ahead, in accordance with
    counsels’ agreement to try the case by that date.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have stressed, counsel in this case agreed to proceed to trial by January
    26, 1996.  Even assuming that, following the settlement of the disclosure
    motion, the litigation might have been vigorously contested and that Mr.
    Ristimaki might have pursued his appeal rights in the face of an adverse
    trial judgment against him, if Mr. Cooper had pressed on to trial before
    January 26, 1996 in accordance with his agreement with Mr. Bastedo, it may
    have been possible to obtain a final enforceable judgment in favour of Mrs.
    Ristimaki before Revenue Canada took its initial steps in January 1997 to
    enforce its claim against Mr. Ristimaki.  The trial judge’s reasons reveal
    no consideration of this contingency, of the implications of Mr. Cooper’s
    failure to insist upon the agreed early trial date, or of his unexplained
    failure to even pursue this option.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Had
    such a final judgment been obtained prior to January 1997, Mrs. Ristimaki,
    as a judgment and execution creditor of her husband, would have been positioned
    to enforce her judgment against Mr. Ristimaki before Revenue Canada’s claim
    crystallized, thereby avoiding the consequences of a prior ranking claim
    by Revenue Canada under the Crown prerogative against the funds held in trust
    by Mr. Bastedo and Mr. Ristimaki’s other assets.  Put another way, if counsels’ 1995
    agreement on an early trial had been honoured, it cannot be assumed that
    Revenue Canada’s claim would have come into competition with Mrs. Ristimaki’s
    claim, or that Revenue Canada’s claim would have prevailed.  The issue of
    competing priorities between judgment creditors may simply have been avoided
    all together.</p>

    these comments, I do not wish to be understood as suggesting that the trial
    judge erred in finding that Mr. Ristimaki’s violation of Canadian tax law
    could not have been anticipated.  That is not the issue.  Mr. Cooper knew
    from the outset of his retainer that Mr. Ristimaki was a real flight risk.  Within
    a short time after his retainer, Mr. Cooper also knew that Mr. Ristimaki
    held assets offshore, that he was threatening to prevent or frustrate any
    meaningful recovery by his wife in the matrimonial litigation and that there
    was a significant risk that Mr. Ristimaki himself would leave the jurisdiction
    permanently, perhaps prior to discovery and probably before trial.  These
    factors alone required that the case be moved to trial on an urgent basis.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the end, the findings of the trial judge do not provide a sufficient basis
    upon which to fully assess Mr. Cooper’s conduct in failing to try Mrs. Ristimaki’s
    case after the settlement of the disclosure motion and prior to January 1997.  Nor
    does the record permit this court to fairly determine the realistic likelihood
    of Mrs. Ristimaki obtaining an exigible judgment against her husband before
    January 8, 1997 (when Revenue Canada filed its certificate with the Federal
    Court), or to assess whether an early and expedited trial date and, potentially,
    an expedited appeal date could have been obtained in these circumstances
    in sufficient time to avoid competition between Mrs. Ristimaki’s and Revenue
    Canada’s claims.  Consequently, these are matters to be determined by a trial
    judge upon proper evidence.  </p>

    my view, the trial judge failed to apprehend the significance of the evidence
    related to the failure to move this case to trial, especially the evidence
    of counsels’ agreement on an early trial date.  He may well have erred in
    this regard because he focused on the time grid analysis.  He concluded that
    the activities that were taken on behalf of Mrs. Ristimaki in the second
    period were sufficient and that Mr. Cooper had discharged his duty to his
    client.  In so concluding, the trial judge’s analysis ignores that there
    was another and more compelling need.  </p>
