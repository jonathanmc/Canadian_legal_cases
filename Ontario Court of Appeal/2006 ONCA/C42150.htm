  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In September 1997,
    at a golf course in Windsor, the appellant Talib Lake offered to sell crack
    cocaine to an undercover Ontario Provincial Police officer.  About a week
    later, Mr. Lake delivered 99.2 grams of cocaine to the officer in Detroit,
    Michigan.  He was indicted in a United States District Court for unlawful
    distribution of a controlled substance.  If found guilty, he faces a mandatory
    minimum sentence of ten years imprisonment without parole. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The respondent,
    the United States Government, seeks Mr. Lake’s extradition.  When extradition
    proceedings began, Mr. Lake was a Canadian citizen living in Ontario.  He
    was, nonetheless, committed for extradition and the Minister of Justice has
    ordered his surrender.  In this court, he seeks judicial review of the Minister’s
    surrender order.  His counsel advances three grounds of review: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>1) the Minister failed to give adequate reasons for holding
    that Mr. Lake’s surrender would not infringe s. 6 of the <i>Charter</i>; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>2) the Minister failed to do a proper “<i>Cotroni</i> assessment” and
    therefore, erred in holding that Mr. Lake’s surrender would not infringe
    his right to remain in Canada under s. 6 of the <i>Charter</i>; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>3) the United States’ minimum sentence for distributing
    crack cocaine is arbitrary and disproportionate, and therefore Mr. Lake’s
    surrender to face this sentence breaches his rights under both s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> and
    s. 44(1)(a) of the <i>Extradition Act</i>.</p>

    the OPP began an undercover investigation into drug trafficking in Essex
    County.  The investigation was known as Project Cyclone.  It lasted several
    months.  During the course of the investigation, sixty people were arrested.  One
    of those arrested was Mr. Lake.  </p>

    OPP first became aware of Mr. Lake when his cousin told the police that Mr.
    Lake was his supplier.  The OPP then investigated Mr. Lake’s activities and
    eventually charged him with several drug related offences, including conspiracy
    to traffic in cocaine in Windsor and Detroit between September 11 and September
    22, 1997.  However, Mr. Lake was not charged in Canada with the substantive
    offence of trafficking.</p>

    1997, Mr. Lake, his cousin and an undercover officer, Ralph Faiella, met
    on a golf course in Windsor.  During the meeting Mr. Lake offered to sell
    Mr. Faiella crack cocaine for $1,625.00 per ounce.  Mr. Faiella said that
    he would buy.  He and Mr. Lake agreed to get in touch with each other later.  The
    OPP then contacted the FBI about the pending purchase.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Mr. Lake telephoned
    Mr. Faiella and told him he was prepared to sell 4 ounces of crack cocaine.  He
    told Mr. Faiella to meet him in front of Kinko’s restaurant in Detroit at
    11:00 a.m. on September 22, 1997.  Mr. Faiella obtained the buy money and
    a body pack tape recorder from the FBI, and met Mr. Lake at the appointed
    time and place.  Mr. Lake got into Mr. Faiella’s car and they drove to Mr.
    Lake’s car.  Mr. Lake produced 99.2 grams of crack cocaine and Mr. Faiella
    gave him $6,500.00 for the drugs. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Mr. Faiella returned
    to Windsor with the drugs and handed them over to an FBI agent who had been
    helping him.  He also gave the agent the body pack tape recorder.  The agent
    took the drugs and the surveillance tape back to the United States.  On October
    19, 1998 Mr. Lake was indicted in Michigan for distributing crack cocaine.</p>

    guilty to the Canadian offences for which he had been charged.  As I have
    said, the offences included conspiracy to traffic in cocaine.  That conspiracy
    resulted in and ended with the sale of crack cocaine to Mr. Faiella in Michigan.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In the Canadian
    sentencing proceedings, the Crown took into account the outstanding indictment
    in Michigan.  In the light of that indictment, Crown counsel agreed to a
    joint submission for a three-year sentence (in addition to 8 months pre-trial
    custody), a rather lenient disposition for Mr. Lake’s activities.  The Crown
    explained his position to Ouellette J., the sentencing judge: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    States, in which the evidence is compelling, and the likelihood of him being
    convicted in the United States as a result of the events of September 22,
    1997, are high.  The crown has taken that into account with respect to looking
    at the entire situation.  And that was a motivating factor as far as the
    crown was concerned with respect to this sentence which I acknowledge is
    on the low end of the range with respect to these types of offences…</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><b>1)        Did the Minister give adequate reasons for
      holding that Mr. Lake’s surrender would not infringe s. 6 of the <i>Charter</i> </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Minister held that surrendering Mr. Lake for extradition would not infringe
    his right as a Canadian citizen to remain in Canada, a right guaranteed by
    s. 6 of the <i>Charter</i>.   Mr. Lake submits that the Minister had a duty
    to give adequate reasons for this holding and that he breached this duty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree that the Minister had a duty to give adequate reasons for his surrender
    order.  Although a Minister’s surrender order lies at the legislative or
    political end of administrative decision-making, it nonetheless has serious
    consequences for the person subject to it.  The surrender proceedings will
    be fair only if at the end of those proceedings, the person to be surrendered
    is told the reasons for the decision.  Reasons are especially important when
    the person to be extradited claims a breach of a <i>Charter</i> guarantee.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>U.S.A
      v. Johnson</i>, (2002) 170 C.C.C. (3d) 538 at paras. 46-47 my colleague
      Gillese J.A. emphasized the Minister’s obligation to give adequate reasons
      for a surrender decision.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>[46] In my view, the Minister must give reasons for his decision.  The
    holding of L’Heureux-Dubé J. in <i>Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship
    and Immigration)</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817, at para. 43, a case arising in
    the context of deportation, applies equally to the decision to surrender
    under the <i>Extradition</i> <i>Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>In my opinion,
    it is now appropriate to recognize that, in certain circumstances, the duty
    of procedural fairness will require the provision of a written explanation
    for a decision.  The strong arguments demonstrating the advantages of written
    reasons suggest that, in cases such as this where the decision has important
    significance for the individual, when there is a statutory right of appeal,
    or in other circumstances, some form of reasons should be required.  This
    requirement has been developing in the common law elsewhere.  <i>The circumstances
    of the case at bar, in my opinion, constitute one of the situations where
    reasons are necessary.  The profound importance of an H &amp; C decision
    to those affected, as with those at issue in Orlowski, Cunningham, and Doody,
    militates in favour of a requirement that reasons be provided.  It would
    be unfair for a person subject to a decision such as this one which is so
    critical to their future not to be told why the result was reached</i> [emphasis
    added]. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>[47] The decision to surrender a fugitive to an extradition party is as
    important as the humanitarian and compassionate determination under s. 114(2)
    of the <i>Immigration Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2 (now s. 25(1) of the <i>Immigration
    and Refugee</i> <i>Protection Act</i>, S.C. 2001, c. 27), dealt with in <i>Baker</i>.  The
    appellant was entitled to reasons that were responsive to the factors relevant
    to his situation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reasons
    in extradition proceedings serve the same purposes as they do in ordinary
    litigation.  See <i>R. v. Sheppard</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869.  They should
    tell the person being extradited why the surrender order was made; and they
    should permit a reviewing court to determine whether the Minister applied
    the proper principles and fairly considered the person’s claim not to be
    surrendered.  If the Minister’s reasons for surrender meet these twin purposes,
    they will be adequate.</p>

line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Minister’s reasons for holding that Mr. Lake’s surrender would not breach
    his s. 6 <i>Charter</i> right were brief.  But, in my view, they were adequate.  The
    Minister said the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>You have argued that, pursuant to <i>Cotroni</i>, <i>supra</i>, it is a
    “realistic option” to prosecute Mr. Lake in Canada for the offence of distribution
    of cocaine.  With respect, I disagree.  The transfer of cocaine from Mr.
    Lake to Cst. Faiella is alleged to have taken place in the City of Detroit.  Canada
    has no jurisdiction to prosecute this offence.  Even if some form of prosecution
    in Canada were possible, in the circumstances of this case, I would yield
    to the superior interest of the United States of America in prosecuting this
    matter.  The evidence alleged that Mr. Lake trafficked cocaine within the
    boundaries of the United States of America.  The United States of America
    is entitled to seek to protect its own public and maintain public confidence
    in its laws and criminal justice system through prosecution.</p>

line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    reasons tell Mr. Lake why he is being extradited: in the Minister’s view
    the United States has a superior interest in prosecuting him.  The reasons
    also permit this court to determine whether the Minister conducted a proper “<i>Cotroni</i> assessment” or
    whether he committed a reviewable error in that assessment.  I would not
    give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;

    Lake claimed that extraditing him to the United States would infringe his
    right to remain in Canada under s. 6 of the <i>Charter</i>.  In considering
    that claim, the Minister had to assess whether the desirability and effectiveness
    of a prosecution in Canada would justify denying the request for extradition.  The
    Minister typically makes that assessment by considering the set of factors
    listed in <i>United States of America v. Cotroni</i>,<i> </i>[1989] 1 S.C.R.
    1469 at para. 56.</p>

    Lake submits that the Minister failed to do a proper <i>Cotroni</i> assessment,
    and as a result infringed s. 6 of the <i>Charter</i>.  In connection with
    this submission, Mr. Lake argues that the Minister’s <i>Cotroni</i> assessment
    is not entitled to any deference from this court.  Correctness, he argues,
    is the proper standard of review of a Ministerial decision affecting constitutional
    rights.  </p>

    dealing with Mr. Lake’s substantive submission on section 6, I will address
    the standard of review.  A correctness standard for constitutional issues
    relating to a surrender order finds support in several decisions of the British
    Columbia Court of Appeal.  The earliest decision is <i>Canada (Minister of
    Justice) v. Stewart</i> (1998), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 423 at paras. 17-18 where
    Donald J.A. wrote:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>[17] The authorities seem clear that on the general question of surrender
    much deference ought to be accorded the Minister… </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>[18] What is less clear is whether there should be any deference given
    to the Minister’s disposition of <i>Charter</i> questions addressed for the
    first time a the surrender stage of the extradition process.  I have concluded
    that deference is inappropriate and that the reviewing court should examine
    the Minister’s <i>Charter</i> decisions on the standard of correctness.  While
    the present structure of the process makes it necessary for the Minister
    to determine these matters in the first instance, it should be recognized
    that what the Minister is really deciding is whether her executive act would
    violate the <i>Charter</i>.  If deference were accorded her assessment of
    the constitutional validity of her own act then I believe that judicial review
    would be unacceptably attenuated.  In my opinion, a person affected by an
    executive decision is entitled to the full measure of <i>Charter</i> scrutiny
    unrestricted by notions of deference.   It is only at the review stage that
    a neutral, uninvolved examination of the decision can take place. </p>

    the principal decision on the standard of review is the Supreme Court of
    Canada’s judgment in <i>U.S.A. v. Kwok</i>, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 532.  Although
    Arbour J., writing for the court, cited <i>Stewart</i> with approval, I do
    not believe that she fully endorsed it.  She wrote at paras. 94-95:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    v. Canada (Minister of Justice)</i> (1998), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 423 (B.C.C.A.),

    Minister must apply the correct test or the correct legal principles; if
    the Minister does not do so then the surrender order will be reviewable on
    the correctness standard.  If, however, the Minister applies the correct
    test, the weighing of the factors relevant to that test is entitled to deference.  To
    summarize what Arbour J. concluded in <i>Kwok</i> at para. 95, if on a consideration
    of the relevant factors the Minister’s surrender order is “clearly reasonable”,
    a reviewing court ought not to interfere.</p>

    Lake contends that the Minister erred in his <i>Cotroni</i> assessment for
    two reasons: the Minister applied the wrong principle because he erroneously
    concluded that Canada had no jurisdiction to try the offence for which he
    is to be extradited; and the Minister erred by failing to consider all the <i>Cotroni</i> factors.  I

    repeat for convenience the Minister’s brief reasons on s. 6 of the <i>Charte</i>r.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>You have argued that, pursuant to <i>Cotroni</i>, <i>supra</i>, it is a
    “realistic option” to prosecute Mr. Lake in Canada for the offence of distribution
    of cocaine.  With respect, I disagree.  The transfer of cocaine from Mr.
    Lake to Cst. Faiella is alleged to have taken place in the City of Detroit.  Canada
    has no jurisdiction to prosecute this offence.  Even if some form of prosecution
    in Canada were possible, in the circumstances of this case, I would yield
    to the superior interest of the United States of America in prosecuting this
    matter.  The evidence alleges that Mr. Lake trafficked cocaine within the
    boundaries of the United States of America.  The United States of America
    is entitled to seek to protect its own public and maintain public confidence
    in its laws and criminal justice system through prosecution.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    his first contention, Mr. Lake focuses on the sentence
    “Canada has no jurisdiction to prosecute this offence.”  Taken in isolation
    this sentence gives force to Mr. Lake’s argument.  His offer to deliver crack
    cocaine took place in Windsor.  Therefore, even though the delivery took
    place in the United States, he could have been prosecuted for trafficking
    (by offer) in Canada.  See <i>R. v. Libman</i>, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 178; <i>Controlled
    Drugs and Substance Act</i>, S.C. 1996, c.19, s. 2 (1).</p>

    this jurisdictional question is unimportant because the Minister went on
    to consider Mr. Lake’s s. 6 claim on the assumption that
    “some form of prosecution in Canada were possible.”  He then correctly applied
    the test under <i>Cotroni</i>.</p>

    that played a major role in the development of the case (the third factor) – the
    OPP.  However, the Minister is not required to refer expressly to each <i>Cotroni</i> factor.  See <i>United
    States of America v. Whitley</i> (1994), 20 O.R. (3d) 794 (C.A.), reasons
    adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 467.  Unless Mr.
    Lake can show that the factors the Minister did not refer to would make his <i>Cotroni</i> assessment
    unreasonable, this court should not interfere with the surrender order.  I
    do not think that Mr. Lake can do so.</p>

    my view, the Minister’s <i>Cotroni</i> assessment was
    “clearly reasonable”.  The United States has a greater interest than Canada

    the buy money and surveillance coverage, and took custody of both the electronic
    and narcotic evidence.  In short, the American government has a legitimate
    interest in prosecuting Mr. Lake in its own territory.  I would not give

      Lake’s argument on arbitrariness arises from the different sentencing regimes
      in the United States for distributing crack cocaine and distributing powdered
      cocaine.  Mandatory minimum sentences in the United States for drug offences
      are based on quantity and substance.  The United States scheme equates
      the distribution of one unit of crack cocaine to the distribution of 100
      units of powdered cocaine.  Distributing over 50 grams of crack cocaine
      merits the ten-year mandatory minimum sentence Mr. Lake faces.  To merit
      a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence for distributing powdered cocaine,
      a person would have to distribute at least 5 kilograms.  </span></p>

      is not the test under s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> or under s. 44(1)(a) of
      the <i>Extradition</i> <i>Act</i>.  The test is far more stringent: to
      offend s. 7 the foreign sentence must “shock the conscience” or be “simply
      unacceptable”.  See <i>Kindler v. Canada (Minister of Justice)</i>, [1991]
      2 S.C.R. 779; <i>United States of America v. Burns</i>, [2001] 1 S.C.R.

    “unjust” or “oppressive”.  The arbitrariness of a sentence may be a consideration
    in whether a sentence infringes s. 7 or s. 44(1)(a), but it alone is not
    determinative.  Even a sentence that would not pass constitutional muster
    in Canada would not necessarily offend s. 7.  We do not require that foreign
    criminal sentencing policies meet Canadian constitutional norms.  See <i>Canada

      United States has chosen to treat trafficking in crack cocaine far more
      gravely than trafficking in powdered cocaine.  It appears to have had valid
      reasons – born of its own experience – for doing so.  Mr. Miller on behalf
      of Mr. Lake fairly told us that the United States circuit courts of appeal,
      without exception, have rejected constitutional challenges to the 100:1
      ratio<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

      had a rational basis for treating the distribution of crack cocaine more
      severely: it viewed the distribution of crack as a greater threat than
      the distribution of powdered cocaine because it was less expensive and
      thus more easily obtained; and it thought crack cocaine to be more addictive.</span></p>

      save in exceptional circumstances, of which this is not one, I think it
      unwise for a Canadian court to, in effect, put United States sentencing
      policy on trial.  Compare <i>United States of America v. Burns, supra</i>.  It
      is not for this court to pronounce on the wisdom of that policy.  Ordinarily
      deference to ministerial decisions, grounded in considerations of comity,
      weighs against judicial intervention.  And that is especially so because

      consecutive sentences for conspiring to commit an offence and for the offence
      that was the sole object of the conspiracy.  Yet, if convicted, he will
      receive what amounts to consecutive sentences, making his sentence in the

      Canadian standards, even on a guilty plea.  Also, in several cases, this
