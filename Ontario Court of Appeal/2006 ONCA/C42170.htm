  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment
      of Justice James M. Donnelly of the Superior Court of Justice, dated June
      11 2004, made at Woodstock, Ontario.</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>LASKIN J.A.:</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>A. INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>     The appellant,
    Joanne Ursic (now Verbeek) and the respondent, Eric Ursic, are the parents
    of Jacob Ursic, who is now four and a half years old. This appeal is principally
    about the custody of Jacob. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>     The parties had
    lived together since 1995, and were married in 2000. Jacob was born in September
    2001. In December 2003, when Jacob was a little more than two years old,
    the appellant and the respondent separated, though they continued to live
    under the same roof until June 2004. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>     Over four days
    in April and May 2004, the parties litigated the question of custody before
    Donnelly J. Each parent sought sole custody of Jacob. Each parent has a job – Mrs.
    Verbeek is an athletic officer at Fanshawe College in London, and Mr. Ursic
    is a high school teacher in St. Thomas – and each put forward a different
    parenting plan for Jacob.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>     In his lengthy
    and reasoned decision, reported at [2004] O.J. No. 3550 (Sup. Ct. J.), Donnelly
    J. ordered that the appellant and respondent share “joint custody in the
    parallel parenting mode”. He set out a detailed parenting schedule, under
    which Jacob was to live with each parent about half the time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>     Jacob’s mother
    has appealed to this court, contending that the trial judge erred in failing
    to award her sole custody of Jacob. She advances three main submissions in
    support of her appeal:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge erred
    by putting the father’s interests ahead of Jacob’s best interests.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge erred
    by presuming co-parenting was appropriate, even though Jacob had never been
    solely in his father’s care.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge erred
    by granting joint custody in the face of a history of conflict between the
    parents on how best to raise Jacob.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also asks this court to order child support in accordance with
    the <i>Child Support Guidelines</i>, S.O.R. /1997-175. Although child support
    was in issue before the trial judge, he did not deal with it in his decision. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>B. RELEVANT MATTERS BETWEEN
      TRIAL AND APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      events that have taken place after trial and before the argument of the
      appeal had a bearing on this court’s decision. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge delivered his decision on June 11, 2004. After filing her notice
      of appeal, the appellant sought a stay of the trial judgment. On July 30,
      2004, Gillese J.A. granted a stay on revised terms of access to which the
      parties agreed. These terms, though different from those ordered by the
      trial judge, still gave the parties roughly equal time with Jacob.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      parties then agreed to mediate their dispute before Lang J.A. To assist
      in the mediation, they also agreed to ask Morrison Reid, a social worker,
      to deliver an assessment report and recommend a parenting plan for Jacob.
      The mediation did not resolve the parties’ dispute. However, Mr. Reid delivered
      an interim report in August 2005 and a final report in September 2005.
      Those reports were filed as fresh evidence on the appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
      Reid concluded that “joint custody over one year has demonstrated the ability
      to meet Jacob’s needs well, and should be continued.” He recommended a
      parenting plan somewhat different from the plan endorsed by Gillese J.A.,
      but under which Jacob would continue to live with each parent approximately
      half the time. At Appendix A to these reasons is a copy of Mr. Reid’s recommended
      parenting plan.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By
      September 2005, Jacob was ready to start kindergarten. The parties could
      not agree on which school he should attend, each preferring one closer
      to his or her residence. Mr. Reid recommended that Jacob go to Northridge
      Public School, the school closer to his mother’s home. Mr. Ursic accepted
      this recommendation; in return, Mrs. Verbeek agreed to Mr. Reid’s parenting
      plan. There are relatively minor differences between the plan recommended
      in Mr. Reid’s interim report, and the plan recommended in his final report.  Since
      September 2005, Jacob has been cared for in accordance with the plan in
      Mr. Reid’s final report.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>C. THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS ON
      APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      appeal, Mrs. Verbeek still seeks sole custody of Jacob. Mr. Ursic is content
      with the trial judge’s order for joint custody and parallel parenting,
      and with the parenting plan recommended by Mr. Reid, which has now been
      in effect for nearly nine months. Mr. Ursic, however, contends that he
      should have the final say on the school Jacob attends. Neither party wants
      a new trial.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>D. CUSTODY OF JACOB</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      following brief overview will put the appellant’s submissions in context.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      record shows a pattern of considerable conflict between Jacob’s parents,
      especially over how best to raise Jacob. Mr. Reid commented on this conflict
      in his final report:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Joanne and Eric report that conflict
      has continued in their relationship since their separation. They agree
      that this conflict is usually about their differing perspectives about
      Jacob’s needs and what should be an appropriate parenting plan.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Despite
      this conflict, the appellant and respondent have largely succeeded in putting
      Jacob’s interests above their own, and they have not exposed their son
      to their differences. For this they are to be commended. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>What
      is also clear from the record, and from the findings of the trial judge,
      is that each parent is both competent and caring, and each has a loving
      relationship with Jacob. Although Mrs. Verbeek took a one-year maternity
      leave after Jacob was born, and in that sense has been Jacob’s primary
      caregiver, Mr. Ursic has been actively involved in his son’s upbringing.
      Each parent has sufficiently flexible hours of work to be able to spend
      considerable time with Jacob.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge put his views of the parents this way:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Jacob has lived in the same house
      with his parents each of whom has an abiding motivation to contribute to
      his care and well being. It is beyond question that each parent loves Jacob.
      At his age his preference was not in issue. Although the marriage failed,
      from Jacob’s perspective the home environment was stable thanks to the
      combined efforts of the parents. Each parent offers and has the ability
      to provide supervision, guidance, education, the necessaries of life and
      for such needs as may arise. The proposed plans for Jacob’s care and upbringing
      are similar, each in the early stages involving parental care supplemented
      by family or commercial care providers. Both parents are stable. Both are
      the biological parents (para. 38).</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>Each has demonstrated through their months of living separately in
      the same home that they are mature. . . In that unquestionably difficult
      circumstance they were able to maintain stability for Jacob through their
      personal difficulties. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>Both parents are well on the plus side of competence. They are genuinely
      committed to Jacob’s well-being and are capable of operating at a level
      above their grievances. It is beyond doubt that they are capable of carrying
      out a parallel parenting plan in Jacob’s best interest (paras. 49-50).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Appellate
      review of a trial judge’s determination of a child’s best interests is
      necessarily limited. It is the trial judge who lives through the human
      drama as it unfolds. It is the trial judge who hears each party’s entire
      story and has the opportunity to assess each party’s witnesses. And it
      is the trial judge who can best put in perspective each party’s inevitable
      criticism of the other. For these reasons, it is the trial judge who is
      in the best position to determine the parenting plan that would most accord
      with the child’s best interests.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Of
      course, if a trial judge commits a palpable and overriding factual error,
      or a material legal error, or unreasonably exercises his or her discretion,
      then an appellate court has a duty to intervene. But it should do so only
      in these limited circumstances. Many authorities of this court and the
      Supreme Court of Canada affirm this limited scope of appellate review in
      custody cases. One example is the decision of Cory J. and Iacobucci J.
      in <i>P. (D.) v. S. (C.) (Droit de la Famille – 1150)</i>, [1993] 4 S.C.R.
      141 at 192:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>  Similarly the trial judge is
      in the best position to assess evidence pertaining to the best interests
      of the child. It is the trial judge who not only hears the evidence but
      also has the great advantage of watching the demeanor of all who testify.
      It is the trial judge who can take into account the significant pauses
      in the responses, the changes in facial expression, the looks of anger,
      confusion and concern. In the vast majority of cases as a result of hearing
      and seeing all the witnesses, it is the trial judge who is in the most
      advantageous position to determine the best interests of the child. </span></p>

      turn now to the appellant’s three submissions. First, she argues that the
      trial judge put the respondent’s interests ahead of those of Jacob. She
      relies on para. 41 of the trial judge’s reasons, where he said: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>No reason is found in the evidence
      why the Applicant should not have full opportunity to participate in Jacob’s
      upbringing. He has much to offer in terms of a calm and patient disposition,
      dedication, guidance and love. Jacob will benefit in large measure from
      association with his father and paternal grandparents. Jacob’s care is
      not in question, when in his father’s custody. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant contends that this paragraph shows the trial judge’s concern
      for “the father’s rights” and not the child’s best interests. I do not
      read it that way. Rather, the trial judge is simply saying that Jacob will
      benefit from his father’s participation in his upbringing. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Moreover,
      this paragraph has to be read in the context of the reasons as a whole.
      The trial judge began his judgment with this question: “The issue – [w]hat
      custody and access arrangements are in the best interests of Jacob …”.
      The trial judge also expressly refers to s. 24 of the <i>Children’s Law
      Reform Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C-12, which directs the court to decide
      custody “on the basis of the best interests of the child.” And the trial
      judge effectively concludes at para. 47 that it is in Jacob’s best interests “to
      maintain a relationship with both parents beyond that provided by access.” Therefore,
      I would not give effect to the appellant’s first submission.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant’s second submission is that the trial judge wrongly presumed
      co-parenting was appropriate even though Jacob had never been solely in
      his father’s care. I do not agree with this submission either. It is true
      that up until the trial, the respondent did not have sole care of Jacob.
      But that does not preclude a joint custody order.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>More
      germane to the appellant’s submission, the trial judge did not start from
      the presumption that a co-parenting arrangement was the appropriate arrangement.
      Quite the opposite. He concluded at para. 45 that “this is that rare case
      where, although the mother has much to offer, Jacob’s best interest demands
      the Applicant Father must have a meaningful and secure role in his life.” And
      he added, “[t]he parallel parenting concept is no one’s first choice” (para.
      48). But in the trial judge’s view, “it [is] substantially preferable to
      the other options.” Thus, I would not give effect to the appellant’s second
      submission.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant’s third submission is that a joint custody order was not appropriate
      because the parties were continually in conflict over how best to raise
      Jacob and could neither co-operate nor communicate with each other on his
      upbringing. Courts have generally been reluctant to order joint custody
      where parents are unwilling to set aside their differences and work together
      to raise their child or children. See for example the reasons of Weiler
      J.A. in <i>Kaplanis v. Kaplanis</i> (2005), 10 R.F.L. (6th) 373 (Ont. C.A.).
      Here, however, despite the conflict between them, the parties, to their
      credit, have largely co-operated on major decisions affecting Jacob. The
      issue of Jacob’s schooling, to which I will return later in these reasons,
      is the exception. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Also,
      importantly, the trial judge did not merely order joint custody. He included
      with it a parallel parenting order. Many trial courts have recognized that
      joint custody under a parallel parenting regime may be suitable where both
      parents love the child and should play an active role in the child’s life,
      yet have difficulty communicating or reaching a consensus on the child’s
      upbringing. See <i>T.J.M. v. P.G.M</i>. (2002), 25 R.F.L. (5th) 78 (Ont.
      Sup. Ct. J.), and <i>Mol v. Mol</i>, [1997] O.J. No. 4060 (Sup. Ct. J.).
      The trial judge viewed parallel parenting to be suitable in this case,
      and I am not persuaded that he erred in ordering it. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Overall,
      nothing in the record affords a basis for changing the joint custody order
      to an order for sole custody in favor of the appellant. The trial judge
      did not commit a reviewable error of fact or law, and he did not exercise
      his discretion unreasonably. Moreover, the fresh evidence filed on appeal
      supports the wisdom of the trial judge’s decision. We are now at a distance
      of two years from the trial. The evidence available to us suggests that
      Jacob has thrived under the regime ordered by the trial judge. Mr. Reid
      confirmed this to be so in his assessment report and, therefore, concluded
      that the trial judge’s joint custody order should continue:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Jacob believes his parents to
      be friends, which would not be the situation if he had experienced exposure
      to their animosity toward each other. It is an observation and conclusion
      of this assessment that Jacob has a strong loving relationship with his
      mother and father and both are competent caring parents. Because of Jacob’s
      current excellent progress with respect to child development, his lack
      of exposure to parent conflict and his strong relationship with competent
      parents, there are no reasons to suggest a decrease in parenting time for
      either parent or a change of the present joint custody arrangement. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      summary, the trial judge’s findings are supported by the evidence at trial
      and buttressed by the opinion of the one expert who has assessed the child.
      I would therefore dismiss the appellant’s appeal in respect of the custody
      of Jacob.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However,
      I add these four concluding comments. First, for the past nine months Jacob
      has lived with each parent under the parenting plan recommended by Mr.
      Reid. That plan differs from the plan ordered by the trial judge. In the
      interests of continuity and stability, it is sensible for Jacob to be cared
      for under Mr. Reid’s plan. To that extent, I would vary the order of the
      trial judge.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
      typically when a court orders parallel parenting, it allocates decision-
      making on major matters, so that in case of a conflict, one parent will
      have the final say. The trial judge did not allocate decision-making in
      this case. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fortunately,
      and again to their credit, the parties have agreed on most major matters
      affecting Jacob – his health care, religious upbringing and extracurricular
      activities. One major exception is schooling. The parties cannot agree
      on the school Jacob should attend, and each wants the right to make that
      decision. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      do not think it appropriate for this court to allocate decision making
      on schooling. However, I think it is fair to provide that Jacob should
      continue to go to Northridge Public School unless both parties agree to
      send him to another school, or unless either parent brings forward compelling
      and cogent evidence showing a change of schools is in Jacob’s best interest.
      I would so provide for these reasons: Mr. Reid recommended that Jacob go
      to Northridge; Jacob will likely already have formed attachments to the
      school; and, continuing at the school promotes stability in Jacob’s life.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third,
      before the trial began, both parties asked the trial judge to order an
      assessment report on Jacob. The trial judge refused their request, and
      proceeded with the trial. Although a trial judge has discretion whether
      to order an assessment, and although the trial judge in this case no doubt
      thought a speedy trial was in everyone’s best interests, I expect an expert
      assessment of Jacob before trial would have been useful both to the court
      and to the parties. I can do no better than repeat the words of Gillese
      J.A. in her decision on the appellant’s stay motion:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In particular, in a situation
      where there is a high degree of conflict and the child is but a toddler.
      This is a situation that cries out for expert assessment and the benefits
      such information could give trial judge. While assessments are the discretion
      of the court, it may have been an error to refuse to order one where such
      expert testimony would be of such use and need to the trial judge.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-US>As is apparent from my reasons, I have found the expert
      assessment of Jacob prepared after trial of great assistance in deciding
      this appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fourth,
      I comment briefly on one aspect of the trial judge’s parenting schedule.
      At paras. 55 and 56, he provided that Mr. Ursic have care and control of
      Jacob
    “without interruption for the month of July” and that Mrs. Verbeek similarly
    have care and control of Jacob for all of August. When those terms came into
    effect in the summer of 2004, Jacob was not even three years old and had
    not been out of his mother’s care for more than two consecutive days. The
    well known expert, Peter Jaffe, who filed an affidavit in support of Mrs.
    Verbeek’s stay motion, commented on the inappropriateness of these provisions:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In my opinion, these extended
      periods of time without contact with the other parent are contra-indicated
      by the child’s age and stage of development. In fact, it likely is harmful
      to a child’s sense of security and primary attachments for this schedule
      to occur. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      concur. Indeed, the trial judge appeared to recognize that extended periods
      with one parent to the exclusion of the other were ill advised. Earlier
      in his reasons at para. 45, he rejected the idea of “week-about shared
      custody” as being “too extreme for a child of Jacob’s age and fails for
      want of security and stability.” In fashioning a summer parenting schedule,
      the trial judge appears to have overlooked his own reasoning. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However,
      Gillese J.A. gave Mr. Ursic access for two weekends in August. Most importantly,
      Jacob is by all accounts a resilient child and he managed to cope during
      these extended periods when he did not see one or the other of his parents. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>E. CHILD SUPPORT</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant claimed child support at trial, but the trial judge did not address
      her claim. Both parties are salaried employees. Mr. Ursic, however, earns
      more than Mrs. Verbeek. He should therefore pay net child support in accordance
      with the <i>Child Support</i> <i>Guidelines</i>. I assume that the parties,
      with the assistance of their counsel, can work out the appropriate monthly
      figure. Support should be paid from June 1, 2004, the beginning of the
      month in which the trial judge delivered his judgment.  </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>F. CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      am not persuaded that the trial judge committed a reviewable error in awarding
      joint custody under a parallel parenting regime. I would, however, vary
      his parenting schedule by implementing the schedule recommended by Mr.
      Reid, which has now been in effect since September 2005. Otherwise, I would
      dismiss Mrs.Verbeek’s appeal concerning the custody of Jacob.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      would allow her appeal on child support, and order that Mr. Ursic pay her
      child support in accordance with the <i>Child Support Guidelines</i>, effective
      June 1, 2004.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
      Mr. Ursic has largely succeeded on the appeal, I would order that the appellant
      pay his costs of the appeal, including the stay motion before Gillese J.A.
      I would fix those costs in the amount of $6,000, inclusive of disbursements
      and GST.</span></p>

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>RECOMMENDATIONS</span></u></h4>
  <p><span lang=EN-US>1. Joint custody of Jacob Ursic be awarded to his father,
      Eric Ursic, and his mother, Joanne Verbeek.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-US>2. Jacob to reside with his father the first three of every
      four weekends from Friday evening until Monday morning, and Wednesday evening
      and overnight prior to and following the fourth weekend when he is not
      in his father’s home. Jacob to reside with his mother the fourth of every
      four weekends. If a stat holiday or P.D. day is concurrent with a  weekend,
      it is to be considered part of the weekend. This schedule is to reverse
      in the summer when Eric Ursic is on vacation from teaching. With the exception
      of the one full week of vacation with both parents during July and August,
      Jacob will reside with his mother on weekends from Friday to Monday morning
      with weekends including statutory holidays and with his father Monday until
      Friday evening.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-US>3. The parenting plan may change to an arrangement where
      Jacob resides with each parent half of each week when he begins to attend
      school full days. In this situation, Jacob would reside with each parent
      the same two consecutive day and overnight periods Monday and Tuesday with
      one parent, Wednesday and Thursday with the other parent, and on alternate
      weekends with Friday considered part of each weekend.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-US>4. Religious holidays, Thanksgiving holiday and Jacob’s
      birthday to rotate between each parent’s home on a yearly basis. Christmas
      and March break school vacations to be divided equally between the parents.
      In the summer, each parent to have one week of vacation with Jacob in July
      and August. When Jacob is 8 years of age, two week consecutive vacation
      periods are acceptable with each parent.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-US>5. The parents to communicate with each other about school,
      health care and religious decisions.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-US>6. Each parent to have direct contact with teachers, doctors,
      mental health professionals, and others such as religious and community
      activity leaders.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-US>7. In the event of disagreement about education, health
      care or religion, the parents are to follow the advice of the professional
      responsible for Jacob’s care in these concerns. </span></p>
