      authorities found a large quantity of cocaine secreted in the handle and
      tubing of the appellant’s suitcase when he attempted to enter Canada at
      Pearson International Airport on his return from Kingston, Jamaica.  Knowledge
      was the only issue in dispute at trial.  The appellant testified that he
      did not know there was cocaine hidden in his suitcase.  In support of its
      position that the appellant knew that the cocaine was in his luggage, the
      Crown relied on statements made by him to Customs officials before the
      luggage was x-rayed and the cocaine discovered.  The Crown maintained that
      the appellant told several lies to the Customs officials in an effort to
      present himself as a person who did not fit the profile of a drug courier.  These
      lies concerned the appellant’s place of employment, his place of residence
      and his marital status. The Crown argued that these false statements constituted
      circumstantial evidence that, taken with the rest of the evidence, could
      support the inference that the appellant knew that there was cocaine hidden
      in his luggage.</span></p>

      defence challenged the admissibility of the statements at trial.  Initially,
      the defence took the position that the statements had not been shown to
      be voluntary.  Subsequently, the defence also argued that the admission
      of the statements, which were made under statutory compulsion, would violate
      the appellant’s rights under s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  The defence submitted
      that the statements should be excluded under s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.  The
      trial judge found against the appellant on both arguments.  The appellant
      did not challenge the voluntariness of the statements on appeal, but did
      renew the s. 7 argument.  </span></p>

      trial judge also rejected the defence argument that the statements, even
      if admissible, could not provide evidence from which the court could infer
      that the appellant knew that there was cocaine hidden in his luggage.  The
      trial judge used the false statements as circumstantial evidence of the
      appellant’s knowledge that there was cocaine hidden in the suitcase.  The
      appellant renewed this argument on appeal.  I will address it before turning
      to the s. 7 claim.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant argues that false statements made by an accused can support an
      inference of guilt only if certain preconditions are met.  He submits that
      absent those preconditions, a statement found to be untrue can only affect
      an accused’s credibility (if he testifies) and cannot provide affirmative
      evidence of an accused’s guilt.  The appellant relies on caselaw that addresses
      the circumstances in which lies told by an accused can constitute after-the-fact
      conduct providing circumstantial evidence of an accused’s guilt:  <i>e.g.</i> see <i>R.
      v. O’Connor</i> (2002), 170 C.C.C. (3d) 365 (Ont. C.A.).  </span></p>

      appellant’s submission misconstrues <i>O’Connor</i> and similar cases.  The
      potential evidentiary value of false statements made by an accused turns
      on the generally applicable principles of relevance and materiality, and
      not on any rules unique to false statements.  Statements by an accused
      to the authorities that are found by the trier of fact to be untrue may
      or may not provide circumstantial evidence of the accused’s state of mind.  Those
      statements may provide evidence of the accused’s state of mind if, on the
      totality of the evidence:</span></p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>¨<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the

    statements;  and</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>¨<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    trier of fact can reasonably infer the existence of the relevant culpable
    state of mind from the making of deliberately false statements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      this case, the falsity of the statements allegedly made by the appellant
      to the Customs officials was not in dispute.  The defence did not contend
      that the statements attributed to the appellant were true, but argued that
      he had not made those statements.  The trial judge believed the Customs
      officials.  Having determined that the appellant did make the false statements,
      it followed in the circumstances of this case that he knowingly lied to
      the Customs authorities about his employment, marital status and place
      of residence.  The question of what inference, if any, should be drawn
      from the making of these knowingly false statements was for the trial judge.  An
      appellate court will interfere with the inference-drawing process only
      if the appellant can demonstrate that the inference-drawing process was
      unreasonable or based on some material misapprehension of the evidence.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      nature of the lies told by the appellant and the circumstances in which
      those lies were told, allowed for the reasonable inference that the appellant
      lied to the Customs officials in an attempt to present himself as a responsible,
      law-abiding citizen to “divert suspicion from himself”, and avoid a search
      of his luggage.  That inference was potentially probative on the question
      of whether the appellant knew that there was cocaine hidden in the luggage.  </span></p>

      use against him in criminal proceedings of those compelled statements infringed
      his liberty in a manner that is inconsistent with the principles of fundamental
      justice and contrary to s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  The appellant contends
      that it is a principle of fundamental justice that persons have the ability
      to freely decide whether to speak to the authorities and, if compelled
      to do so by statute, to have those statements excluded from evidence in
      any subsequent prosecution.  The appellant submits that where a person
      is statutorily required to answer questions and is subject to penalties
      for refusing to provide those answers, s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i> requires
      exclusion of those statements in a subsequent criminal proceeding against

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I do not find
    it helpful to start, … with a broad and abstract statement about the absolute

    the principle against self-incrimination. …We should not expect that the
    manifestations of the principle against self-incrimination will have any “pre-defined

    and contextual analysis of the circumstances raised before us, and the ways
    in which concerns about self-incrimination may or may not be legitimate.</u>  In

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>That the principle
    against self-incrimination does have the status of an overarching principle
    does not imply that the principle provides absolute protection for an accused
    against all uses of information that has been compelled by statute or otherwise.  <u>The
    residual protections provided by the principle against self-incrimination
    as contained in s. 7 are specific, and contextually sensitive … The principle

      claim required a balancing of the competing interests in the specific context

      the use of the statutorily compelled statements against the appellant in
      his prosecution for cocaine importation offend the principle against self-incrimination?  It
      is at this stage of the analysis that context becomes crucial.  In assessing
      a s. 7 self-incrimination claim, the court must consider the extent to
      which the rationale underlying the principle against self-incrimination
      is engaged in the specific circumstances, and the extent to which countervailing

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Where the state
    alleges wrongdoing, it cannot force the target of that allegation to assist
    the state in proving the allegation.  This rationale reflects the high premium
    placed on personal autonomy and individual privacy by the principles of fundamental
    justice.  Those principles start from the premise that individuals are entitled
    to choose whether to co-operate with the state and, if they choose not to,
    to be left alone by the state.  The rationale underlying the principle also
    reflects the hard learned lessons of history.  Conscripted evidence is notoriously
    unreliable and the line between state compulsion and state abuse can be a
    fine one.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The section
    7 analysis involves a balance.  Each principle of fundamental justice must
    be interpreted in light of other individual and societal interests that are

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Like
      the trial judge, I think the fact that the impugned statements were made
      at the border in the course of routine questioning by Customs authorities
      is central to the analysis of the appellant’s self-incrimination claim.  No
      one entering Canada reasonably expects to be left alone by the state, or
      to have the right to choose whether to answer questions routinely asked
      of persons seeking entry to Canada.  As the appellant himself testified,
      travellers reasonably expect that they will be questioned at the border
      and will be expected to answer those questions truthfully.  Travellers
      also reasonably expect that Customs authorities will routinely and randomly
      search their luggage.  Put simply, the premise underlying the principle
      against self-incrimination, that is, that individuals are entitled to be
      left alone by the state absent cause being shown by the state, does not
      operate at the border.  The opposite is true.  The state is expected and
      required to interfere with the personal autonomy and privacy of persons
      seeking entry to Canada.  Persons seeking entry are expected to submit
      to and co-operate with that state intrusion in exchange for entry into
      Canada.  </span></p>

      also have no hesitation in describing Canada’s effective control over its
      borders as a societal interest of sufficient importance to be characterized
      as a principle of fundamental justice.  Nothing is more fundamental to
      nationhood and national sovereignty than the ability to control national
      borders.  Effective border control serves a myriad of crucial social interests
      ranging from national self-defence to public health, to the enforcement
      of Canada’s fiscal policies and its penal statutes.  The appellant’s self-incrimination
      claim must be balanced against the equally fundamental societal claim to
      the preservation of the integrity of Canada’s borders through the effective
      enforcement of its laws at those borders.  Effective enforcement extends
      to the successful prosecution of those who are apprehended violating Canada’s
      laws at its borders.  Those laws, of course, include the prohibition against
      the importation of narcotics.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      significance of the border crossing context to the delineation of individual <i>Charter</i> rights
      is evident from the cases that have considered the operation of s. 10(b)
      (the right to counsel) and s. 8 (the protection against unreasonable search
      and seizure) at the border.  Persons seeking entry into Canada are subject
      to state action that can range from routine questioning to highly intrusive
      searches.  The extent to which state action at the border will be said
      to interfere with individual constitutional rights depends primarily on
      the intrusiveness of that state action.  In cases such as <i>R. v. Simmons</i> (1988),
      45 C.C.C. (3d) 296 at 312 (S.C.C.) and <i>R. v. Monney</i> (1999), 133
      C.C.C. (3d) 129 at 149 (S.C.C.), the Supreme Court has recognized three
      levels of state action at the border.  The first, or least intrusive level
      of that action, involves routine questioning of travellers, the search
      of their luggage, and perhaps a pat-down search of the person.  If state
      action involves only this level of intrusion, the rights protected by s.
      10(b) and s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i> are not engaged.  In <i>Simmons</i>, <i>supra</i>,
      at p. 312, Chief Justice Dickson put it this way:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It is, I think,
    of importance that the cases and the literature seem to recognize three distinct
    types of border search.  First <u>is the routine questioning which every
    traveller undergoes at a port of entry, accompanied in some cases by a search
    of baggage and perhaps a pat or frisk of outer clothing.  No stigma is attached
    to being one of the thousands of travellers who are daily routinely checked
    in that manner upon entry to Canada and no constitutional issues are raised.</u>  It
    would be absurd to suggest that a person in such circumstances is detained
    in a constitutional sense and therefore entitled to be advised of his or
    her right to counsel … [emphasis added] … </p>

      Chief Justice’s observation that those who are subject to routine questioning
      and searches suffer no “stigma” is germane to the self-incrimination analysis.  The
      absence of any “stigma” attached to routine questioning and searches at
      the border tells me that where state action does not become more intrusive
      than routine questioning and searches, the relationship between the state
      and the individual cannot be characterized as either coercive or adversarial.  The
      absence of coercion or an adversarial relationship suggests that the principle
      against self-incrimination does not demand the exclusion in subsequent
      proceedings of statements made during routine questioning and searches
      at the border:  <i>R. v. White</i>, at p. 278.</span></p>

      made by an individual in response to questions from an Immigration Officer
      could be used against that person in a subsequent inquiry to determine
      whether the individual’s refugee claim warranted a full hearing before
      the relevant tribunal.  In rejecting the appellant’s claim that he had
      a right to counsel under either s. 10(b) or s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> when

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It is important
    to note that neither the existence of a statutory duty to answer the questions
    posed by the immigration officer nor the existence of criminal penalties

    misleading statement necessitates the conclusion that the appellant was detained
    within the meaning of s. 10(b).  <u>These provisions are both logically and
    rationally connected to the role of the immigration officials in examining
    those persons seeking to enter the country.  Indeed, they are required to
    ensure that border examinations are taken seriously and are effective.  Both
    of these types of provisions also exist in the <i>Customs Act</i>, and as
    I have already discussed, this court held in <i>Simmons</i> at p. 517 that

      expectation of privacy compels the conclusion that personal autonomy and
      privacy – the values animating the protection against self-incrimination – were
      not implicated when the appellant was compelled to answer routine questions
      about his residence and his marital and employment status.  The exclusion
      from evidence at his subsequent trial of these statements, therefore, could
      not vindicate or protect those values.  Exclusion of the answers, however,
      could diminish the state’s ability to effectively enforce its legitimate
      border interests while at the same time impairing the search for the truth

      statements, he had become the target of a criminal investigation.  The
      appellant submits that he became a target when Inspector Harrison’s suspicions
      were aroused by his several prior trips out of Canada in the previous year.  In
      advancing the contention that a “target”
    of a criminal investigation can rely on the protection against self-incrimination

      that the s. 7 protection against self-incrimination attached immediately
      upon an individual becoming a target of a criminal investigation at the
      border, I would not describe the appellant as a target of a criminal investigation
      when he answered the relevant questions.  In this regard, I accept the

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> Second,
      I do not regard the distinction between those who can be said to be targets
      of criminal investigations at the border and those who are not targets
      of such investigations in and of itself determinative of a s. 7 claim.  In
      a general sense, everyone who is questioned at the border and whose luggage
      is examined is the target of an investigation.  Questions are asked and
      routine searches conducted to find individuals who are in breach of border-related
      laws.  It only makes good sense that those responsible for enforcing border
      regulations will focus their routine questions and searches on persons
      who have for some reason attracted their interest.  In my view, the mere
      fact that a person has attracted the suspicion of a Customs official, thereby
      causing that official to ask routine questions and conduct a routine search,
      should not give that individual any enhanced constitutional protection
      against self-incrimination.  </span></p>

      think the proper distinction is between persons, like the appellant, who
      are not detained or subject to any violation of their reasonable expectation
      of privacy when the impugned statements are made and persons who are subject
      to detention, or interference with legitimate privacy expectations when
      statements are made.  Persons who are subject to detention have the constitutional
      right to counsel and the constitutional right to remain silent.  Persons
      who have a reasonable expectation of privacy can expect that the state
      will respect that expectation and not interfere with that reasonable expectation.  The
      existence of these rights and the legitimate expectation of privacy reflect
      the values of autonomy and personal privacy that underlie the protection
      against self-incrimination.  If a person is compelled to answer questions
      at the border while under detention, or while his or her reasonable expectation
      of privacy is otherwise interfered with, a strong argument can be made
      that an attempt to use those answers in a subsequent criminal proceeding
      will run afoul of the principle against self-incrimination.  That argument
      does not have to be resolved on the facts of this case.</span></p>

      whether he could be said to have been a target of a criminal investigation
      at the border, the extent to which the border authorities suspect an individual
      of having committed a particular offence will impact on whether that individual
      is or is not detained when subject to routine questioning.  For example,
      if the border authorities have decided, because of some sufficiently strong
      particularized suspicion, to go beyond routine questioning of a person
      and to engage in a more intrusive form of inquiry, it may well be that
      the individual is detained when subject to that routine questioning:  see <i>Jacoy
      v. The Queen</i> (1988), 45 C.C.C. (3d) 46 (S.C.C.).  As indicated above,
      if the person is detained, the assessment of the s. 7 self-incrimination
