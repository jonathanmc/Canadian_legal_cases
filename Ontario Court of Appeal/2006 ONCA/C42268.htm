    (1997), 152 D.L.R. (4th) 1 (S.C.C.), Iacobucci J., speaking for the court, 
    commented that Canadian courts have added several additional factors to the 
    <i>Bardal</i> list and that the application of these factors to the assessment 
    of a dismissed employee&#8217;s notice period, will depend upon the particular circumstances 
    of the case. At para. 83 of <i>Wallace</i>, Iacobucci J. said the following:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:

    employee has been induced to leave previous secure employment: see <i>E.G.

    According to one authority, many courts have sought to compensate the reliance 
    and expectation interests of terminated employees by increasing the period 
    of reasonable notice where the employer has induced the employee to &#8220;quit 
    a secure, well paying job &#8230; on the strength of promises of career advancement 
    and greater responsibility, security and compensation with the new organization.&#8221;

    to safeguard the employee&#8217;s reliance and expectation interests in inducement 
    situations. I note, however, that not all inducements carry equal weight when 
    determining the appropriate period of notice. The significance of the inducement

    termination in this case. I am mindful of the caution of Iacobucci J. in <i>Wallace</i> 
    that not all inducements will carry equal weight when determining the appropriate 
    period of notice and that the significance of the inducement in question will 
    vary with the circumstances of the particular case. This is certainly not 
    a case where the plaintiff was somehow enticed away, in the pejorative sense, 
    from secure employment with Bell Canada. It is a case, however, where she 
    was encouraged by the defendant&#8217;s employees to seriously consider a change 
    to Alcatel and a case where she could and did reasonably expect that if she 
    did come over, she would enjoy a long relationship with the defendant, absent 
    any cause for her dismissal.</span></p>
