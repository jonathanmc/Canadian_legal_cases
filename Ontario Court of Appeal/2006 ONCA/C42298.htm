style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is a tragic and heartbreaking case.  The appellant, an eighteen year old
    OAC student with a sterling reputation in the community, was driving two
    young friends to a third friend’s home.  They planned to go bowling.  The
    appellant’s vehicle veered across a median into oncoming westbound traffic
    and struck another vehicle.  That vehicle collided with a third vehicle that
    was also travelling westbound.  </p>

      Wolf, a sixteen year old passenger sitting in the backseat of the appellant’s
      vehicle, was killed instantly.  Danielle McLean, a sixteen year old passenger
      sitting in the front seat of the appellant’s vehicle was seriously injured.  The
      appellant was also seriously injured.  Mr. Stanley Levesque, the driver
      of the vehicle struck by the appellant’s vehicle, was seriously injured.  Mr.
      Renald Roussel, the driver of the vehicle that collided with Mr. Levesque’s
      vehicle, was seriously injured, as was his passenger, Nicole Philibert.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant was convicted after a trial by a judge sitting without a jury
      of one count of criminal negligence causing death and four counts of criminal
      negligence causing bodily harm.  He was sentenced to a conditional sentence
      of twelve months to be followed by probation for 30 months.  He appeals
      his conviction and sentence.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      primary submission on the conviction appeal was that the verdict was unreasonable
      and could not be supported by the evidence.  The sentence appeal was limited
      to the submission that the trial judge erred in principle in imposing house
      arrest as a term of the probation order.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      am satisfied that the verdicts must be quashed.  The case for the Crown
      was that the appellant, who was showing off for his female passengers,
      deliberately caused the vehicle to swerve or jerk while he was proceeding
      at about 105 kilometres an hour on an expressway, and that the accident
      occurred when the appellant was unable to regain control of the vehicle
      before it turned into the median and eventually into oncoming traffic.  The
      Crown’s case depended first on the absence of any explanation apart from
      driver conduct for the accident and second on the testimony of Ms. McLean.
      Ms. McLean was sitting in the front passenger seat and described what she
      saw in the two to three seconds before the car swerved into the median.  In
      my view, no reasonable trier of fact properly applying the law of criminal
      negligence could be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant’s
      conduct constituted criminal negligence or dangerous driving.  </span></p>

      appellant had obtained his G2 licence, allowing him to drive unsupervised
      on major highways, about three weeks before the accident.  He had gone
      through driver education training.  The appellant has no criminal record
      and no history of driving infractions.  The defence led impressive character
      evidence describing the appellant as a bright, responsible, quiet, mature,
      young man.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      the early evening of November 2, 2002, the appellant and three young friends
      decided to go bowling.  The appellant drove his Honda to Danielle McLean’s
      home and picked her up.  From there, they drove to Jessica Wolf’s home.  The
      appellant, Ms. McLean and Ms. Wolf drove to the bank so that Ms. McLean
      could get some money.  They left the bank, intending to drive to Valerie
      Votto’s.  She was the third person who was going bowling with them that
      evening.  </span></p>

      appellant entered the E.C. Row Expressway from the Howard Road access.  The
      Expressway is a divided four-lane highway running east and west through
      Windsor. The speed limit is 100 kilometres per hour.  The appellant headed
      east toward the Central Avenue exit, a distance of 3.2 kilometres from
      where the appellant entered the Expressway.  Ms. McLean was sitting in
      the front passenger seat and Ms. Wolf was sitting behind her in the backseat.  Ms.
      McLean said that she looked at the speedometer and the appellant was going
      105 kilometres per hour.</span></p>

      McLean testified that the appellant was driving in a normal and prudent
      manner from the time he picked her up until the car approached the Central
      Avenue overpass.  It was dark, but the evening was clear.  The road was
      dry, well lit, and in good condition.  There was no suggestion that the
      appellant had consumed alcohol or any other drug.  There was also no suggestion
      that he was having any difficulty controlling the vehicle before it reached
      the Central Avenue overpass.  </span></p>

      Neilson was driving eastbound on the Expressway at about 7:00 p.m.  She
      was driving behind the appellant’s vehicle after he accessed the Expressway
      from Howard Road.  The appellant was driving in the curb lane.  Ms. Neilson
      observed the appellant’s vehicle swerve “slightly”.  It did not leave the
      curb lane.  She described the swerve as  a
    “correction”.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      Neilson continued eastbound, driving behind the appellant’s vehicle.  The
      appellant’s vehicle moved into the passing lane and passed a few cars.  As
      the appellant approached the Central Avenue overpass, he moved back into
      the curb lane.  Apart from the slight swerve of the appellant’s vehicle,
      Ms. Neilson did not notice anything unusual about the appellant’s driving.  She
      estimated that he was going 108 kilometres per hour.</span></p>

      Neilson testified that just before the appellant’s vehicle reached the
      overpass at Central Avenue, it began to fishtail.  The appellant’s brake
      lights flashed as his vehicle fishtailed.  According to Ms. Neilson, the
      appellant’s vehicle fishtailed more than once.  As the vehicle passed under
      the Central Avenue overpass, it turned ninety degrees to the left, entered
      the median, passed through the median, and veered into the westbound lanes
      of the Expressway.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Based
      on measurements taken by the investigating officers, the appellant’s vehicle
      travelled about 3.2 kilometres from the point where Ms. Neilson observed
      the
    “slight” swerve to the point where it began to fishtail.  The physical evidence
    indicated that the car veered into the median about eighty metres west of
    the Central Avenue overpass.</span></p>

      McLean’s evidence was crucial to the Crown’s case.  Her credibility was
      not in issue.  She did her best to recount accurately what she saw and
      felt immediately before the accident.  </span></p>

      McLean testified that everything was fine until just after the vehicle
      went under the Central Avenue overpass.  She was talking to Ms. Wolf in
      the backseat and was not looking at the appellant.  Because Ms. McLean’s
      evidence is so important, I will quote it at length.  In her examination-in-chief,
      she said:</span></p>

      the act of criminal negligence occurred entirely within a two to three

      from the conduct expected of a reasonable driver if the appellant deliberately
      jerked the steering wheel to cause the vehicle to swerve, presumably to
      either show off or frighten his young passengers.  If that finding was
      reasonably open on the evidence, then the appellant could properly have
      been convicted of criminal negligence, as he was unable to regain control
      of the vehicle before it crossed the median and collided with the westbound

      it left the road cannot be reasonably attributed to any deliberate act
      by the appellant.  Nor can it be connected to the accident.  Whatever happened
      to the appellant’s vehicle at Howard Road, it was so slight that it went
      unnoticed by Ms. McLean.  The appellant’s driving in the ensuing three
      kilometres was normal and demonstrated no failure to control the vehicle.  Ms.

      as the vehicle came out of the Central Avenue overpass, it jerked dramatically.  Third,
      Ms. McLean could not say what caused this dramatic jerking of the vehicle.  Fourth,
      within two or three seconds after the initial jerk, the vehicle had lost
      control and entered the median.  Fifth, the appellant did not regain control
      of the vehicle at any point during that two to three second interval.  Sixth,
      Ms. McLean saw the appellant turning the steering wheel back and forth
      after she felt the first significant jerk, but could not say whether he
      was turning the wheel to make the jerking worse or in an attempt to regain
      control of the vehicle.  </span></p>

      McLean’s evidence does not provide a basis for a reasonable inference that
      the appellant deliberately caused what Ms. McLean described as the first
      dramatic jerking of the vehicle as it passed under the Central Avenue overpass.  Nor
      does her evidence offer a basis for a reasonable inference that the appellant
      deliberately caused the subsequent jerking of the vehicle by turning the
      steering wheel back and forth.  As she candidly acknowledged, he may have

      my assessment of the evidence, the most that can be said is that the appellant
      suddenly lost control of his vehicle and was unable to regain control of
      the vehicle before it entered the median.  This conclusion certainly suggests
      a momentary lapse of attention by the appellant, but, in my view, cannot

      thorough reasons of the trial judge provide insight into the path he followed
      in convicting the appellant.  With respect, I think that those reasons
      reveal three errors.  The trial judge failed to address the cause or the
      significance of the initial dramatic swerve or jerk of the vehicle.  He
      also improperly relied on the absence of any explanation for the loss of
      control by the appellant.  Lastly, he drew a speculative inference from
      the evidence that the appellant seemed to regain partial control of the
      vehicle in the two or three seconds between the initial jerk of the vehicle
      and when it entered the median.  I will now address each of these errors. </span></p>

      trial judge made no finding as to the cause of the first dramatic swerving
      of the vehicle that occurred when Ms. McLean was not looking at the appellant.  In
      concluding that the appellant was guilty of criminal negligence, the trial
      judge concentrated only on the “jerking a steering wheel from side to side
      at a speed of 105 to 110 kilometres per hour”.  The jerking of the steering
      wheel that Ms. McLean did see occurred after the first dramatic swerving
      of the vehicle and on her evidence was equally consistent with an attempt
      to regain control of the vehicle.  I think the assessment of whether the
      appellant’s conduct amounted to criminal negligence could not begin with
      the evidence that he jerked the steering wheel back and forth after the
      vehicle had begun this dramatic swerving, but had to begin with the cause
      of the initial swerve.  As I have already indicated, there was no evidence
      from which it could be inferred that the appellant deliberately caused

      the course of his reasons, the trial judge made several references to the
      absence of any explanation from the appellant for his loss of control of
      the vehicle.  The trial judge’s references to the absence of any explanation
      referred both to the absence of an explanation when Ms. McLean and Ms.

      a charge of criminal negligence or dangerous driving, if, on an objective
      view of the driving, the driving would constitute the offence of criminal
      negligence or dangerous driving, the trial judge may infer the necessary
      fault component from the conduct itself, absent some explanation that would
      negate that fault element.  For example, an accused who drives across several
      lanes of traffic into oncoming traffic may explain what is <i>prima facie</i> negligent
      or dangerous driving by adducing evidence that he suffered a sudden heart
      attack immediately before losing control fo the vehicle:  see <i>R. v.

      of the initial swerving of the vehicle and further permitted no inference
      that the appellant had at any time in the crucial two to three seconds
      deliberately caused the vehicle to swerve or jerk.  As the evidence does
      not permit the conclusion, objectively viewed, that the driver’s conduct

      wheel back and forth, Ms. McLean could not recall the appellant doing or
      saying anything in the two to three seconds between the first jerk of the
      vehicle and the vehicle entering the median.  I do not think his silence
      can reasonably support an inference that he deliberately turned the wheel
      to cause the vehicle to swerve.  To the contrary, if as the Crown alleged
      he must have been showing off or trying to frighten his young female passengers,
      one would have expected something in the appellant’s demeanour or some
      statement by him to support the existence of that motivation.  In my view,

      from retrograde amnesia and had no memory of the relevant events.  Any
      evidentiary value that may be attributable to the absence of an explanation

      the appellant as regaining partial control of the vehicle before the final
      jerk that caused the vehicle to turn to the left and enter the median.  The
      trial judge inferred from this evidence that the appellant had some control

      McLean testified that the appellant did seem to have some success in regaining
      control of the vehicle after the initial swerve and before it entered the
      median two or three seconds later.  This apparent success was obviously
      short-lived.  Even if one could safely rely on Ms. McLean’s sense that
      the appellant had partially regained control of the vehicle, the fact that
      he was able to do so does not reasonably permit an inference either that
      he deliberately caused the vehicle to initially lose control or that he
      deliberately caused the final swerving of the vehicle into the median.  The
      appellant’s temporary and partial success in bringing the vehicle under

      for one’s actions takes various forms.  Criminal, civil and personal responsibility
      are often very different matters.  These proceedings are concerned exclusively
      with the appellant’s criminal responsibility.  Criminal responsibility
      turns on the Crown’s ability to prove beyond a reasonable doubt on properly
      admitted evidence each element of the offence.  For the reasons set out
      above, I am satisfied that, on the evidence adduced, the Crown could not
      meet that burden.  That conclusion, of course, says nothing about the appellant’s
      civil liability or, perhaps most importantly, his personal responsibility
      for what happened.</span></p>

    of the trial judge are reported at [2004], O.T.C. 753 (S.C.J.).  Those reasons
    differ from the reasons in the transcript of the trial proceedings.  Counsel
    both argued that the court must proceed on the basis of the reasons found
    in the transcript of the trial proceedings.  We agree.  References to reasons
    for judgment are references to the reasons found in the transcript.</p>

<div id=ftn2>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><a href="#_ftnref2"
name="_ftn2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a> At trial,
    the defence sought a stay of proceedings based on the appellant’s retrograde
    amnesia.  The defence argued that the appellant was unable to make full answer
    and defence because of his medical condition.  The trial judge rejected that
    argument.  In oral argument on appeal, Ms. Henein did not ask the court to
    stay the proceedings, but she did argue that the appellant’s retrograde amnesia
    was a relevant factor in assessing the reasonableness of the verdict, especially
    in the light of the trial judge’s emphasis on the absence of any explanation
    by the appellant for the accident.  </p>

    reasons set out below (para. 33), I do not think that Ms. Neilson’s evidence
    describing a “slight” swerve had any probative value for the Crown.</p>
