      The third parties asked for costs of the motion to be awarded against the
      Magdas, but because the Magdas were unable to pay any costs, the third
      parties asked that the Crown be made responsible for half of the award.

      Magda was the manager of classified accounting at the St. Catharines Standard
      newspaper from the 1970s until her dismissal in April 1997. As manager
      of the department, it was her role to receive and record payments from
      customers who placed classified ads and to prepare the daily bank deposits.
      She was a trusted employee of the Burgoyne family that owned the newspaper
      until they sold it to Southam Inc. in 1996. It turned out that over a 30-year
      period, Ms Magda had been stealing significant amounts of the classified
      ad revenues by intercepting cheques as they were received and using the
      cheques to replace cash which she retained and never deposited in the company
      account. As part of the scheme to conceal the fraud, she removed matching
      invoices from the paper’s records and maintained them in her desk, along
      with adding machine tapes that detailed her transactions. When she felt
      enough time had passed, she sent these records to the basement for shredding.
      Unbeknownst to her, however, the newspaper had discontinued its shredding
      program as a cost-cutting measure; therefore, when suspicion arose about
      some classified ad revenue discrepancies in 1997, these records were discovered
      and used to explain and prove her fraud. </span></p>

      search warrants were executed at the Magdas’ home and banks, the authorities
      found over 1000 garments bags containing designer clothing worth over $500,000,
      most of which still had price tags on, approximately 800 pairs of ladies’ shoes
      in their boxes, over $50,000 in jewelry with price tags on, large quantities
      of collector plates, crystal, artwork, perfume and make-up supplies, several
      bank accounts containing over $500,000 in deposits and three safety deposit
      boxes with cash, jewelry, and gold coins and wafers. </span></p>

      consequences of this huge fraud were far-reaching.  The Burgoyne family
      sold the newspaper for 4 to 5 million dollars less than its true value,
      had the actual classified ad revenues been known. Staff at the paper had
      been laid off or had their salaries reduced because of the paper’s financial
      difficulties. The city itself suffered because the Burgoyne family had
      always been generous in funding charitable projects.</span></p>

      Magdas were each represented in the criminal proceedings by counsel appointed
      by the court under a <i>Rowbotham</i> order, based on this court’s decision
      in <i>R. v. Rowbotham </i>(1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 1. Counsels’ accounts
      were paid by the Crown but at legal aid rates. Prior to trial, defense
      counsel launched a motion seeking very widespread production of financial
      documents from the third parties, the original owner of the newspaper,
      the current owner and their accountants, including monthly bank statements,
      deposit slips, lists of employees and their contact information, financial
      statements, working papers and correspondence.</span></p>

      response to the motion, the third parties filed a comprehensive brief setting
      out details of how the crime was carried out along with supporting documentation.
      They objected to producing all of the documentation requested on the basis
      of privacy concerns. The purpose of the brief was to show that the balance
      of what was requested was unnecessary and therefore irrelevant. The Crown
      also led <i>viva voce</i> evidence elaborating on the brief filed by the
      third parties and explaining its position that the privacy rights of the
      third parties would be compromised by the type of production sought by
      the Magdas.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      court held a four-day hearing on the motion, after which the Magdas abandoned
      their request with respect to the accountants, but required the court to
      rule on the motion as it affected the other two third parties. The trial
      judge concluded that the evidence filed by the third parties made it clear
      that the motion was unnecessary. This was because there had already been
      disclosure of the necessary documents by the Crown as well as substantial
      production in the context of a civil action that had been brought by the
      two owners against the Magdas. Second, the records now being sought were
      highly confidential and private and had no bearing on the issues before
      the court. Most significantly, the reason the further records were not
      relevant for the Magdas’ purposes was that the monies stolen by Lucy Magda
      had been diverted from the newspaper’s revenues before they were ever accounted
      for in the financial records. The trial judge therefore observed that the
      financial status of the paper had nothing to do with the charges. The trial
      judge concluded that the motion was a fishing expedition, and a tactic
      to try to get the prosecution withdrawn by the parties that had been victimized.</span></p>

      the court ordered some minimal further production which the third parties
      did not oppose. However, the financial cost to the third parties to have
      their solicitors respond to the motion was substantial: $22,703.67 for
      the owners, and $23,724.23 for the accountants. The trial judge found both
      those bills to be reasonable.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      third parties sought an order for reimbursement of these costs, first from
      the Magdas, but because the Magdas were judgment proof, either from Legal
      Aid, charged as a disbursement of counsel, or from the Crown.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      considering the request the trial judge made three findings of fact: (1)
      the third parties voluntarily disclosed everything that was logically relevant
      and only resisted the excessive demands; (2) the Crown was free from criticism
      and had produced everything in its possession that was logically relevant;
      and (3) both Burgoyne and the newspaper had already suffered significant
      losses as a result of Lucy Magda’s actions. In that context, he concluded
      that the Magdas should bear the costs of the motion, and made an order
      to that effect.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
      there was no authority to order Legal Aid to pay costs ordered as a disbursement,
      the court declined to make such an order.  However, the trial judge found
      that the extensive material prepared by the third parties in response to
      the motion had relieved the Crown of its costly burden of defending the
      motion and, in effect, had shifted that burden to the third parties. Relying
      on the case of <i>R. v. Law Office of Simon Rosenfeld</i>, [2003] O.J.
      No. 834 (S.C.J.), the trial judge ordered the Crown to contribute half
      the costs incurred by each of the third parties with a right to recover
      from the Magdas.</span></p>

      in a criminal matter is in ss. 809(1) and 826 of the <i>Criminal </i><i>Code</i>,
      which pertain only to summary conviction matters. The only common law or
      inherent jurisdiction to award costs against the Crown arises in the very
      narrow and limited circumstances where there has been Crown misconduct
      or the breach of a <i>Charter</i> right such as failure to make proper

        v. Garcia</i> (2005), 194 C.C.C. (3d) 361, this court discussed the two
        broad categories of circumstances when costs have been awarded against
        the Crown in summary conviction appeal proceedings under the court’s
        statutory jurisdiction. One is where there is Crown misconduct. The other
        is where: “other exceptional circumstances exist such that fairness requires
        that the individual litigant not carry the financial burden flowing from
        his or her involvement in the litigation” (para. 13). For example, a
        costs award may be appropriate when the prosecution is a test case that
        transcends the particular circumstances of the accused and the accused’s
        personal interest in the outcome of the appeal is minimal.</span></p>

      the context of the indictable offence of manslaughter in <i>R. v. Curragh
      Inc.</i> (1997), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 481,  the Supreme Court of Canada awarded
      costs incurred by the accused in both the original and the new trial<i> </i>to
      be paid by the Crown. The new trial was ordered on appeal based on a finding
      of reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the trial judge. In making
      the costs order, the court characterized the problems that caused the costly
      delays in the case as “systemic” and referred to the circumstances as “unique”.<i></i></span></p>

      to award costs in the case of <i>R. v. Chapman </i>(2006), 78 O.R. (3d)
      778. Factually, that case also involved an application by the accused for
      third party records. The records belonged to the Children’s Aid Society
      and, as in this case, the motion was dismissed. The trial judge granted
      the third party Children’s Aid Society’s request that its costs be paid
      by the accused. On the appeal, the Criminal Lawyers’ Association as intervenor,
      supported the position of the accused that the court had no jurisdiction

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>[15]…to the extent that a Superior Court may have inherent jurisdiction
      to make a costs order in a criminal matter against an accused person, the
      Crown concedes, and I agree, that the trial judge erred by departing from
      the general principles governing the making of such an award, thereby fashioning
      a legal standard that makes it easier to obtain a costs award against an
      accused person than it is to obtain a costs award against the Crown.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>[16] In this respect I observe that the jurisdiction in issue is not
      a broad discretionary jurisdiction, but rather is based on the inherent
      jurisdiction of the court to control its own process. In <i>Attorney-General
      of Quebec et al. v. Cronier</i> (1981), 63 C.C.C. (2d) 437 (Que. C.A.),
      L’Heureux-Dubé J.A. described that jurisdiction as follows, at pp. 449

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>[TRANSLATION] A superior court has the power to maintain its authority
      and to control its procedure so as to put justice in order and efficiently.
      That this implies sometimes ordering one of the parties and even lawyers
      to pay the costs of a proceeding in cases of the abuse or of the frivolity
      of proceedings, of misconduct or dishonesty or of taken for some other
      ulterior motive, is a recognized principle. But the conditions for the
      exercise of this inherent power must exist.</span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span

      of control and supervision.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>On the one hand, the Judge cannot authorize himself to do indirectly
      what the Canadian criminal law does not expressly authorize him to do,

      remedies in criminal matters. In the absence of reprehensible conduct by
      the appellants, or a serious affront to the authority of the Court or of
      a serious interference with the administration of justice, which is not
      the present case, the imposition of costs on appellants in the context
      of the present debate is in no way justified.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>[17] In this case, by rejecting fault or some form of conduct requiring
      censure as at least an element of what is necessary to justify a costs
      award in a criminal matter, the trial judge erred in principle. Therefore,
      the costs order cannot stand on the basis on which it was made.</span></p>

      is clear that the Quebec Court of Appeal in <i>Cronier</i>, followed by
      this court in <i>Chapman</i>, considered Crown misconduct or a serious
      interference with the authority of the court or with the administration
      of justice to be an essential prerequisite for a trial judge to make an
      order of costs against the Crown. As there was neither Crown misconduct
      nor extraordinary circumstances amounting to an interference with the authority
      of the court or with the administration of justice in this case, the court
      is bound by its existing jurisprudence to allow the appeal, unless the
      issue were to be reconsidered by a five-judge panel of the court. </span></p>

      those circumstances, counsel were invited, together with counsel in another
      case where a related issue was raised, to reargue the case before a five-judge
      panel of this court. Such a panel would have been free to consider whether
      there are other categories of circumstances, such as where a third party
      victim has incurred costs in order to protect its privacy interest in documents
      sought by an accused in a criminal case, where the costs incurred by that
      party could be ordered payable by the Crown. The parties were reluctant
      to take the opportunity to reargue the case. In those circumstances, we
      are bound by the earlier decision of this court in <i>Chapman</i> and must
      set aside the costs award against the Crown.</span></p>

      leaving the analysis however, I wish to comment on three further issues
      in the context of this appeal. The first is the trial judge’s reliance
      on the <i>Rosenfeld</i> case. In <i>Rosenfeld</i>, the Crown had seized
      numerous documents from the home of the accused, a lawyer. Before any of
      the documents could be used by the Crown in the prosecution, issues of
      solicitor-client privilege had to be determined. For that purpose, the
      Court ordered that a referee be appointed to review the documents. The
      court also ordered that the cost of the procedure was a cost of prosecution
      and must be borne by the Crown.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>That
      situation is substantially different from the case at bar where it is the
      accused who sought the production of third party records. They were not
      documents required by the Crown for the prosecution. Had those records
      been in the possession of the Crown and not disclosed as a matter of Crown
      misconduct, then that would be a different rationale for an award of costs
      against the Crown, as a <i>Charter</i> breach.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
      since the argument of this appeal, two cases were decided, one by the British
      Columbia Court of Appeal and one by the Ontario Court of Justice, dealing
      with whether the costs of an order for the production of documents in the
      possession of a third party unconnected with the proceeding, should be
      borne by the Crown under either s. 18 of the <i>Mutual Legal Assistance
      in Criminal Matters Act</i> R.S.C. 1985, c. 30 (4<sup>th</sup> Supp.) or
      under s. 487.012 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In <i>Canada
        (A.G.) v. Pacific International Securities Inc</i>. (2006),<i> </i>209
        C.C.C. (3d) 390 (B.C.C.A.), New York authorities requested production
        of documents from a securities dealer in B.C. in connection with a prosecution
        in New York. The request was made under the <i>Mutual Legal Assistance </i>statute,
        court orders were obtained and the dealer produced the documents. However,
        subsequent orders became very onerous and costly for the securities dealer
        to comply with and a request was made for the costs of compliance, such
        as wages paid to employees who worked on fulfilling the requests, to
        be borne by the Crown. <i></i></span></p>

      majority of the Court of Appeal found that the Superior Court judge had
      erred in making an order for costs against the Crown. The court held that
      the legislation constitutes a complete code that does not provide for Crown
      reimbursement of the expenses of compliance. As the Act is in the nature
      of a criminal statute, the normal restrictions on costs awards against
      the Crown apply.<i></i></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In <i>Tele-Mobile
        Co. v. Ontario</i>, [2006] O.J. No. 2589 (Ont. Ct. J.), an order was
        made under s. 487.012 of the <i>Criminal </i><i>Code </i>requiring Telus
        to produce phone records in connection with a murder investigation by
        the Ontario Provincial Police. Telus sought an order for reasonable compensation
        to help defray the costs of complying with the order. This was effectively
        a test case, as Telus would be the subject of numerous orders of this
        kind because it is in the telecommunications business. Although the court
        was sympathetic to the position of Telus, it held that there was no statutory
        authority to make a compensation order. Under s. 487.015 a court can
        grant an exemption to a person named in such an order if it would be
        unreasonable in the particular circumstances to require compliance; but
        on the facts of that case, the court was unable to find that those circumstances
        existed. As an addendum to its reasons, the court suggested that Parliament
        might consider a scheme for reasonable compensation to third parties
        who are ordered to produce documents to assist with criminal investigations.<i></i></span></p>

      written submissions made following the release of <i>Pacific International </i>and <i>Telus</i>,
      the Crown argued that these two decisions support its position on the appeal.
      The third parties submitted that the two cases were distinguishable from
      the case at bar because they involved statutory jurisdiction, while in
      this case the court was being asked to exercise its inherent or common
      law jurisdiction to control its own process. The basis of the argument
      for the award in this case was that the third parties effectively fulfilled
      a Crown obligation to oppose the <i>O’Connor </i>motion,<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[3]</span></a> and in that way the Crown delegated
      its obligation to them. The costs were incurred by the third parties fulfilling
      the Crown’s obligation in the prosecution. These arguments are similar
      to those made and rejected in <i>Pacific International </i>and <i>Telus </i>as
      a basis to interpret the relevant legislative provisions to allow a court
      to order compensation. If the argument were accepted in this case, that
      would broaden the basis on which costs orders could be made against the
      Crown beyond the current scope set out in <i>Chapman</i>. <i></i></span></p>

      in their factum, the third parties raised as an “additional issue” an argument
      that the costs award should be viewed as a remedy under s. 24 of the <i>Charter</i>.
      The essence of the argument is that it was only because defence counsel
      was funded by a <i>Rowbotham </i>order and was not subject to the financial
      strictures that would have been imposed by Legal Aid, that counsel was
      able to bring the ill-conceived <i>O’Connor </i>motion. That motion amounted
      to an attack on the <i>Charter</i> privacy rights of the third parties,
      which attack was funded by the Crown and constituted a “re-victimization” of
      the third parties after the initial crime.<i></i></span></p>

      cannot give effect to this argument. First, it was not made at the trial
      and was not the basis upon which the trial judge made the order under appeal.
      Second, the tactics of defence counsel cannot be laid at the feet of the
      Crown because of the particular circumstances of the <i>Rowbotham </i>order.
      The Crown is merely providing the funds to pay for the services of defence
      counsel in the particular circumstances of this case, but of course, the
      Crown has no involvement in the conduct of the case for the defence.<i></i></span></p>
