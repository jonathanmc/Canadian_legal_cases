style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals his conviction and sentence for possession for the purpose
    of trafficking in crack cocaine.  In relation to the conviction appeal there
    are two issues.  The first is whether the trial judge erred in holding that
    the police had reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the appellant.  The
    second is whether the trial judge erred in holding that the cocaine found
    in the appellant’s possession was for the purpose of trafficking as opposed
    to simple possession. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE EVIDENCE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    officers were on uniformed patrol on Yonge Street.  They observed a known
    crack addict, Warden, outside of the Wellesley subway station.  He was pacing
    back and forth, conduct consistent with a user waiting for someone.  They
    noticed the appellant coming towards the user from an alleyway.  He nodded
    his head in acknowledgment of the user, looked about, reached into his pants
    pocket and briefly extended his open palm to the user.  Warden looked at
    his palm.  The appellant then closed his hand and put it back in his pocket.  They
    walked away together.  The two men walked together for a while and then broke
    apart, walking in separate directions.  Neither officer heard if anything
    was said or could see what was in the appellant’s hand.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    officers testified that Warden had admitted his crack addiction to them; <a name="OLE_LINK3">Constable </a>Ryta
    had had numerous dealings with Warden and they were all crack-related; Constable
    Forde said his dealings were related to trespass to property but that whenever
    he saw Warden he had just come down from crack or was looking for crack.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    officers then called the appellant over.  He crossed the street and was arrested
    for possession of crack cocaine for the purpose of trafficking.  He was subsequently
    searched.  The police discovered individually wrapped packages of crack cocaine
    and an exacto knife with residue.  They also found two cell phones.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    an arrest to be lawful, there must be both subjective and objective reasonable
    and probable grounds to believe that an offence has been committed. The appellant
    submits that there was neither a subjective or objective basis on which to
    arrest the appellant.  The appellant also submits that the trial judge conflated
    the subjective and objective grounds for arrest and that in so doing she
    erred. We disagree with these submissions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  The
    comments and reasons of the trial judge indicate that she was alive to the
    issues raised here.  With respect to the subjective grounds for arrest, Warden’s
    alleged admission as to his cocaine use coupled with the officers’ observations
    informed the officer’s subjective belief that they had grounds to arrest
    the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our opinion the trial judge did not conflate the subjective and objective
    grounds to arrest. She correctly stated that the objective person is a person
    with the knowledge that the police had.  That is, the objective person would
    know the particular area involved and the particular location within that
    area was frequently used for drug trafficking.  The reasonable person standing
    in the shoes of the officers would also know of Warden’s drug use. The police
    also had other information about Warden’s drug use. Evidence that Warden
    was a known crack user was properly before the court.  Information received
    from individuals can form part of the grounds for a subsequent arrest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    an objective basis a person standing in the shoes of the police officer would
    have also seen: </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Warden’s
    behaviour of pacing in a location known for crack cocaine trafficking;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    guarded mode of acknowledgment between Warden and the appellant, typical
    of drug transactions;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    appellant’s act of showing Warden a small item in his cupped hands, typical
    of drug deals; and </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='
line-height:normal;'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>both
    men walking off together.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    regard to the above factors we are not prepared to second guess the trial
    judge’s assessment that the police had reasonable and probable grounds, on
    both a subjective and objective basis to arrest.  Her assessment of reasonable
    and probable grounds is entitled to deference on appeal: <i>R v. Feeney</i> (1997),
    115 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (S.C.C.).b </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also submits that the Crown did not prove possession for the purpose
    of trafficking beyond a reasonable doubt  The trial judge was entitled to
    draw the inference she did that the appellant was engaged in possession for
    the purpose of trafficking and again her conclusion is entitled to deference.  We
    would dismiss the appeal as to conviction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentence of 18 months was fit and proper at the time it was imposed.  The
    appellant served seven months of that sentence.  Having regard to the fresh
    evidence filed, and, in particular, that the appellant, a relatively young
    man has now been gainfully employed and supporting his family for over a
    year, we do not feel that any useful purpose would be served by re-incarcerating
    him at this time.  Having served over one&#8209;third of his sentence, he
    is eligible for parole.  The 7 months he has served appears to have had the
    effect of specific deterrence.  As a result, we would grant leave to appeal
    sentence, allow the appeal as to sentence, set aside the sentence of 18 months
    and reduce the sentence to time served plus two years probation.  The firearm
    prohibition remains.</p>
