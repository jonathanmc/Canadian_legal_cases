      of Belleghem of the Superior Court of Justice, dated August 10, 2004.</span></h4>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants seek to set aside the order of Belleghem J. dated August 10, 2004,
    finding that there was an oral agreement binding on the parties.  The agreement
    was that Gold River would provide exclusive management services to the retirement
    residences owned by the appellants in exchange for a 5% value-added equity
    position in those residences upon termination of the management arrangement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants argue that the parties had failed to agree on terms essential
    to the agreement and that the trial judge erred by creating essential terms
    that were not agreed to by the parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is essentially a fact-driven appeal.  Mr. Hallman, through his companies,
    provided the capital for, and developed, elder homecare sites.  Mr. Neid,
    through his company, managed these sites.   The two men worked together for
    approximately five years in the residential retirement home industry before
    Mr. Hallman’s death in June 1999.  Shortly thereafter, the services of Mr.
    Neid and Gold River were terminated by Mr. Hallman’s brother, who took over
    operation of the business.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Neid says that he and Mr. Hallman entered into an oral agreement that provided
    for his exclusive services in exchange for 5% value-added equity.  Although
    no written agreement was ever formalized and signed, Mr. Neid testified that
    the proposals and drafts before the Court simply reflected the exclusivity/equity
    arrangement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the evidence was open to other interpretations, the trial judge accepted
    the plaintiff’s evidence.  He found there was an oral agreement that the
    respondent would be entitled to 5% of the increased value of the retirement
    homes brought about by Mr. Neid’s development and management of the homes,
    in exchange for Mr. Neid devoting his full time and exclusive care and attention
    to the development and management of the homes.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    spite of the appellants’ arguments, we can find no palpable and overriding
    error, or error in law, on the part of the trial judge.  The finding there
    was an oral agreement was open to him on the evidence.  There is a substantial
    body of objective evidence, surrounding circumstances and history between
    the parties which supports the fundamental finding that equity participation
    was not only discussed but was agreed to by Mr. Hallman.  Mr. Neid’s testimony
    that he specifically agreed to – and did – shut down another management project
    in which he was involved, but wanted to finish, because Mr. Hallman insisted
    that “exclusive was exclusive”, is strong evidence in support of the respondent’s
    position.  There is no other reason, in the circumstances, why he would agree
    to do so without the equity participation in exchange.  Although no written
    agreement was ever signed, the parties worked together, apparently on the
    basis of the agreement, for two years prior to Mr. Hallman’s death, with
    no complaints from the other.  Given their relationship, this silence is
    probative of consensus.</p>

    $12,500 plus disbursements and GST.</p>
