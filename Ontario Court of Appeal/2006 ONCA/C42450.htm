      of Justice Norman D. Dyson of the Superior Court of Justice dated September
      2, 2004, dismissing a summary conviction appeal from a conviction entered
      by Justice Donna G. Hackett of the Ontario Court of Justice.</span></h4>

      the conclusion of oral submissions, we dismissed the appeal, with reasons
      to follow.  These are those reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Robert
      Karas was convicted by Hackett J. of the Ontario Court of Justice on two
      counts of assault and assault with a weapon.  He appealed his conviction
      to the summary conviction appeal court on the grounds that Hackett J. erred
      in her approach to assessing credibility and that the verdicts were unreasonable.  The
      summary conviction appeal court judge dismissed the conviction appeal but
      reduced the sentence.  The appellant appeals that decision on the basis
      that the summary conviction appeal court judge erred in not providing reasons
      for his decision to dismiss the conviction appeal.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>At
      the hearing of the appeal, the Crown conceded that the summary conviction
      appeal judge’s failure to give reasons is an error of law.  However, subsequent
      to the oral hearing, the Crown advised the court that brief oral reasons
      had been given by the summary conviction appeal court judge but that they
      had not been recorded and were therefore not available and cannot be reviewed
      by this court.  Because no reporter was present, the summary conviction
      appeal court judge should have put a brief written endorsement on the record.  In
      the absence of reasons capable of review, the appellant is deprived of
      meaningful review by this court of the summary conviction appeal judge’s
      decision concerning any errors of law.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
      fact that there are no reasons that this court can review from the summary
      conviction appeal court judge explaining why he dismissed the appeal does
      not, however, automatically dictate that this appeal be allowed.  This
      court cannot apply the proviso but can consider the trial record and, if
      the reasons of the trial judge do not demonstrate reversible error, dismiss
      the appeal (see <i>R. v. Minuskin</i> (2003), 68 O.R. (3d) 577 (C.A.)).  In
      the present case the Crown filed the appellant’s factum on the summary
      conviction appeal and it is apparent that the grounds of appeal argued
      by the appellant on the summary conviction appeal below were the same grounds
      as are advanced in this court.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant submits that the trial judge decided the case on the basis of
      a credibility contest between Crown and defence witnesses and failed to
      carry out the analysis required pursuant to <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i> (1991),
      63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>We
      do not agree.  The trial judge’s reasons are comprehensive and there is
      no indication that the trial judge viewed her task as the judging of a
      credibility contest between Crown witnesses and defence witnesses.  The
      trial judge properly recognized the fundamental principle that the onus
      rests on the Crown to prove each element of the defence beyond a reasonable
      doubt.  While she did not explicitly articulate the <i>W.(D.)</i> steps,
      it was not required that she mechanically recite them.  Her reasons as
      a whole demonstrate that she took the correct approach to assessing the
      evidence and was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt by the Crown’s evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant further submits that the trial judge engaged in an impermissible
      and erroneous process of reasoning not in accordance with the approach
      set out in <i>R. v. Morin</i> (1988), 44 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.) because
      she came to her decision by a series of separate and exclusive judgments
      on each part of the evidence and did not look at the whole of the evidence
      to weigh its cumulative effect.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not consider the trial judge’s approach to have been improper.  While
    she dealt with the credibility and reliability of the various witnesses,
    there is nothing in her reasons to indicate that, after doing so, she did
    not consider the evidence as a whole before reaching her conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also submits that the trial judge applied a stricter standard of
    scrutiny to the evidence called by the accused than to the Crown evidence.  We
    do not agree.  The reasons clearly demonstrate that the evidence of the Crown
    witnesses was scrutinized and analyzed in as a thorough a fashion as the
    evidence of the defence witnesses.  The fact that she ultimately made positive
    credibility findings with regard to the Crown witnesses does not mean that
    she diminished the standard of scrutiny applied to their evidence.  Her approach
    to assessing the evidence of all the witnesses was fair and even-handed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was clearly evidence on which the appellant could be found guilty.  Mr. Topos’ evidence
    that the appellant waved the saw in his face was corroborated by the evidence
    of Chris Topos and Mr. Oikle, as was Mr. Topos’ evidence that the appellant
    banged his head onto the seat of the van.  The verdict was entirely reasonable
    and supported by the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, leave to appeal is granted but the appeal is dismissed.</p>
