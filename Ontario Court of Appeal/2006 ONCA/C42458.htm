    appellant was tried by a jury for the offences of attempted murder, possession
    of a firearm for a purpose dangerous to the public peace, aggravated assault,
    using a firearm in the commission of the aggravated assault, pointing a firearm
    and setting a trap or a device likely to cause bodily harm.  On October 9,
    2003, the jury found the appellant guilty of three counts, namely, aggravated
    assault, using a firearm in the commission of the aggravated assault and
    pointing a firearm.  The jury found him not guilty on the other three counts.  On
    January 15, 2004, Rutherford J. sentenced the appellant to six years for
    the aggravated assault, two years consecutive for the use of a firearm in
    the commission of the aggravated assault and one year concurrent for pointing
    a firearm. </p>

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant owned a bush farm property in the forested hill country north of
    Wilno, Ontario.  At the time of the offences, the appellant, now a 49-year-old
    man, was living on the property in a house, doing bodywork on one or more
    vehicles and tending to the cultivation of an unspecified number of marijuana
    plants within a few hundred yards of his house.  From the evidence, it appears
    that the appellant was living at a very modest level, using a lot of marijuana
    himself on a daily basis.  His crop was important to him and in the weeks
    prior to the date of the incident, it had suffered significant loss due to
    poachers.  The evidence showed some serious attempts by the appellant, with
    help from his son, to protect his crop, including the use of external video
    surveillance devices and the placement of trip lines connected to alarms.  There
    was also evidence that a number of fishhooks had been strung in and around
    some of the plants, but the jury was not satisfied on the evidence that the
    appellant was responsible for that. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    September 6, 2000, Edward Evenden and an accomplice were engaged in stealing
    marijuana plants from the appellant when they activated a trip wire.  It
    was the third time in a couple of weeks that Evenden had snuck onto the property
    to poach the marijuana plants.  A short time later, Evenden was shot in the
    back while running down the path adjoining the marijuana growth.  The bullet
    entered Evenden’s spine, rendering him a permanent paraplegic. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evenden’s
    evidence was that he unwittingly set off the trip line, which caused an alarm
    to ring.  He then ran from the farmhouse area into a forested area in order
    to avoid being seen by the appellant, a long time friend.  As he ran, he
    heard the appellant shout out.  Evenden next heard shots being fired and
    then was hit and fell to the ground.  The appellant came upon Evenden and
    his accomplice a minute or so later and helped to ensure that Evenden was
    taken to the hospital.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s evidence was that his dogs had barked several times that morning
    and that finally he took his 22-calibre rifle out of the house and, at waist
    level, fired a number of rounds at random towards a tree and into the bush,
    from a point not far from his house.  The appellant said he saw no one and
    did not know any person was around, but thought that in firing off those
    rounds, he would scare the dogs into silence or scare away the animals that
    may have been stirring them up. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
    the point that the appellant said he was shooting, it was likely impossible
    to see Evenden, let alone hit him with a bullet, due to the trees and rising
    ground.  At a point higher up on the rising ground from which Evenden would
    have been able to be seen while he was running away, the police found several
    22-calibre casings on the ground. </p>

lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Issue #1:  Whether the trial
      judge erred in his charge to the jury with respect to the burden of proof
      and approach to fact finding </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits there were two related errors made in the charge to the
    jury with respect to how to approach the evidence, both of which had the
    effect of reversing the burden of proof and convicting the appellant on a
    standard of proof less than beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the outset of his charge to the jury, the trial judge said to the jury that
    it was their job to “find out what happened, if possible, if you can determine
    what happened.”  In this respect the judge echoed a comment by the Crown
    in his closing submissions to the jury.  In his submissions to the jury,
    the Crown outlined the positions of the primary Crown and the Defence witnesses
    and said, “ Well how are we going to test which story is correct?”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant further submits that, given the conflicting evidence as to the
    position of the appellant and whether the alarm had sounded before he fired
    his gun, the jury were being told in effect that they had to choose which
    version of the evidence to accept.  He submits that the jury was not told
    in clear terms that they need not believe the defence evidence in order to
    acquit.  Further, he submits, the jury was not clearly instructed that if
    the appellant’s evidence just raised a reasonable doubt in the context of
    the whole of the evidence, that would be sufficient.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge should not have told the jury that its job was
    “to find out what happened”.  As the Supreme Court states in <i>R. v. Pittiman</i>,
    2006 S.C.C. 9 at para 8.  “The jury’s task is not to reconstruct what happened.  Rather,
    it is to determine whether the Crown has proven each and every element of
    the offence beyond a reasonable doubt.”  However, neither this brief comment
    at the beginning of the charge nor the Crown’s comment in closing could be
    said to have had the effect of reversing the burden of proof or misdirecting
    the jury as to the standard of proof.  The trial judge’s clear direction
    that they were to take the law from him and his correct instructions regarding
    the burden and onus of proof left the jury with a proper understanding of
    their task.  When the charge is read as a whole, there is no reasonable possibility
    that the jury could have understood from the instructions that if they disbelieved
    the appellant they had to convict.  The trial judge repeatedly told the jury
    that if they believed the accused or if they were left in some doubt by the
    evidence, they must find the appellant not guilty.  The jury also had the
    benefit of appropriate instructions regarding the presumption of innocence,
    the burden of proof and the fact that a doubt may arise from the absence
    of evidence.  Counsel for the appellant did not object to the instructions
    on reasonable doubt or the fact-finding process.  We do not agree that the
    trial judge erred in stating that there was a conflict in the evidence.  There
    was a conflict in the evidence regarding what inferences the circumstances
    supported and about what was in the appellant’s mind when he fired the gun.  On
    the appellant’s version, he was just trying to calm the dogs down and was
    completely unaware that anyone else was on the property.  On Evenden’s evidence,
    the inference is that the alarm went off inside the house after he tripped
    it, that the appellant then knew that thieves were on the property and that
    he deliberately shot towards the intruders.  Accordingly, the trial judge
    was not in error in characterizing the evidence as showing conflicting views
    of what the appellant knew and what inference might arise from his conduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would dismiss this ground of appeal. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Issue # 2:  The effect of the
      improper reply evidence and the lack of any instruction thereon.</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that improper reply evidence called by the Crown may have
    played a pivotal role in the jury’s deliberations.  That evidence is as follows.  Without
    seeking leave, the Crown called reply evidence for the sole purpose of contradicting
    the appellant’s credibility on the collateral issue of whether the gun was
    placed in the back of Evenden’s accomplice’s truck.  After the appellant
    testified it was, an officer testified he did not find it when they seized
    and searched the truck some hours after the incident.  Had a timely objection
    been made, the Crown likely would have been precluded from calling reply
    evidence.  However, there was no objection to this evidence and it was not
    related to any of the elements of the offence.  The evidence was not a direct
    contradiction of the appellant’s evidence as it is possible that the driver
    of the truck took the gun out.  In the circumstances, we would not give effect
    to this ground of appeal. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Issue #3:  Whether the caution
      against propensity reasoning was insufficient.</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge’s caution against propensity reasoning
    was deficient in three ways.  First, it failed to address the prejudice to
    the appellant arising from the Crown’s closing address as it related to the
    offence of cultivation, to which the appellant had pleaded guilty in a separate
    proceeding.  Second, the trial judge failed entirely to caution the jury
    with respect to the general bad character evidence introduced at trial regarding
    the appellant and his son.  Third, the trial judge failed to caution the
    jury with respect to reasoning by propensity as between counts. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are not persuaded that there was any error with respect to the reference
    to the cultivation of marijuana.  The entire context of the case revolved
    around the growing of marijuana and the complainant’s repeated thefts of
    the same drug.  Cultivation of marijuana related to the crown’s theory of
    a motive for the shooting and did not amount to merely evidence of propensity
    or bad character.  Moreover, following the Crown’s closing address, defence
    counsel neither objected to the caution nor sought a direction that the jury
    be told to disregard these remarks.  We note that to the extent the impugned
    aspects of the Crown’s address could have been prejudicial, defence counsel
    in this case addressed the jury last although the defence called evidence.  Further,
    the trial judge told the jury to disregard any expressions of opinion the
    jury had heard during counsel’s addresses, to decide the case only on the
    evidence presented and to exclude prejudice from their decision. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to general bad character and the use of evidence between counts,
    the trial judge cautioned the jury on two occasions about deciding the case
    on the basis of sympathy.  The trial judge also carefully and fully instructed
    the jury regarding the limited use they could make of the appellant’s record
    (including his conviction for cultivating marijuana).  He then commented:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>So you may find, if you can draw on these criminal
    histories at all, you may find that the honesty related convictions are more
    important that ones that relate to just misconduct of one sort or another. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    also told the jury that they should not jump to the illogical conclusion
    that the appellant had actually committed the crimes with which he was charged
    because he had done things before and been convicted for it.  He added: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Do not fall into that trap.  It is only part of
    the history that you may draw on if you feel it is worth drawing on to assess
    the evidence the man gives in the witness stand.  It is not propensity evidence
    that, ‘oh well, once a criminal, always a criminal’ or
    ‘once having committed bad things, more likely that he will do bad things
    in the future.’ </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>That is, in a sense it is a human nature error
    that we are inclined sometimes to make.  It is a bias type of reasoning.  It
    is prejudging type of reasoning, prejudicial and I caution you strongly not
    to fall into that trap.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the charge was perhaps less than ideal in relation to the evidence of general
    bad conduct, the trial judge’s comments conveyed to the jury the sense that
    they were not to judge the appellant based on the “bad things” he had done
    in the past.  These comments cautioned the jury more broadly not to engage
    in propensity reasoning.  In addition, the trial judge focussed the jury
    on the real issue in the case.  That issue was where the appellant was standing
    when he fired the gun and the sight lines.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the use of evidence as between counts, this was not a case involving
    separate incidents.  Here, all of the evidence was relevant to all counts
    which arose from one incident and, in the circumstances, we do not agree
    that the instruction as to propensity reasoning was defective.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Issue #4: Whether the trial
      judge unfairly denigrated the defence expert evidence.</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence called Finn Nelson as an expert witness.  He gave evidence about
    the sight lines from where the appellant said he was standing at the time
    he fired the gun and the sightlines where the cartridge casings were found.
    The trial judge said, &ldquo;It was not really opinion evidence within his
    core expertise but you take into account in considering his evidence the
    specialized training and experience he has.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the Crown that here is no basis in the record to say that the
    expert’s evidence was “totally undermin[ed]” by the trial judge’s charge.  Appellant’s
    counsel made no objection to the charge to the jury on this basis.  The witness
    himself described his expertise as being in the fields of “firearms and toolmarks” and
    he was accepted as an expert in those areas.  The expert testified about
    the visibility of a target at two different locations based on his experience
    in army training.  The trial judge properly noted that evidence about line
    of sight might be seen as outside the witness’
    core area of expertise, but he still underlined the witness’ specialized
    training and experience in the army.  In part because of the need to correct
    the misstatements made by defence counsel about the expert’s evidence, the
    trial judge reviewed the line of sight evidence given by the expert and by
    the identification officer very thoroughly.  Coupled with the numerous times
    that the trial judge emphasized the importance of the issue of whether the
    appellant knew that he was shooting at people, the jury could not have failed
    to appreciate how the line of sight evidence related to the defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge reviewed the expert’s evidence thoroughly and did not denigrate
    it. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Issue #5: The sentence appeal.</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge was satisfied that by their findings, the jury must have rejected
    the appellant’s evidence that he did not knowingly shoot at a human being.  The
    jury was obviously convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant
    did see a person/persons running among his marijuana plants, aimed at him/them
    and fired a number of shots, intending either to hit or at least threaten
    him/them with the prospect of being shot.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in principle by disproportionately
    focusing on the tragic consequences of the offence and overemphasizing denunciation.  This
    resulted in him imposing a sentence that was excessively long, having regard
    to the offender and the nature of the offence.  The appellant also submits
    that in this case, while the appellant’s conduct in firing a gun was reprehensible,
    the fact that he demonstrated his concern for Evenden after discovering him
    by ensuring that he was taken to the hospital was a significant mitigating
    factor.  Moreover, there was no premeditation and there was no evidence that
    the appellant was dangerous or incorrigible. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge does not indicate, nor does the sentence imply, that he mistakenly
    believed that the appellant was either the worst offender or that this was
    the worst offence.  The trial judge factored into his decision that the appellant
    said he was remorseful.  As for the appellant’s assistance to Evenden after
    shooting him, this relatively limited help was not a “significantly mitigating” factor.  If
    the appellant were really as devastated by the shooting as he maintained,
    one might have expected him to override Evenden’s alleged wishes and summon
    properly trained emergency personnel by calling 911.  Instead, he allowed
    Evenden to be taken to the hospital by his accomplice.</p>

    agree with the Crown that the total sentence of eight years’ imprisonment
    was appropriate in light of the following circumstances: (1) the appellant
    kept a loaded semi-automatic rifle by his door, ready to be used to repel
    thieves; (2) the jury’s verdicts meant that they found that the appellant
    deliberately shot at a person intending or threatening to apply force; (3)
    the appellant’s motive must be inferred to have been to protect his illegal
    marijuana crop; (4) the physical injuries to Evenden have rendered him a
    permanent paraplegic; (5) the impact on Evenden’s family has been devastating;
    (6) there is a need to denounce and deter those who are prepared to defend
    illegal grow operations with firearms; (7) although dated, the appellant
    has three prior convictions for assault; and (8) the sentence imposed is
    not out of the wide range of sentences that may be applied in similar cases.</p>
