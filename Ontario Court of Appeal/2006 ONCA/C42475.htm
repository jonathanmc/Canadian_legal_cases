    Aristorenas delivered a baby by Caesarian section on June 1, 2000.  She was
    at a high risk for infection after the delivery because of her obesity.  After
    her discharge from hospital, she developed an infection.  Over a two&#8209;week
    period she was treated by Dr.&nbsp;Jeffrey Gilmour, an obstetrician and gynaecologist,
    and several home care nurses employed by Comcare Health Services (“Comcare”).</p>

    found that both defendants had been negligent in their post&#8209;natal treatment
    of Ms.&nbsp;Aristorenas, that their negligence caused Ms.&nbsp;Aristorenas’ injury,

    had a four&#8209;year old child, Jasel, and worked as a legal secretary.  She

    who was involved in Ms.&nbsp;Aristorenas’
    post&#8209;natal hospital care, continued the antibiotic until her discharge
    on June&nbsp;5.  On discharge, Dr.&nbsp;Gilmour prescribed an oral antibiotic.  He
    did not observe any infection at that time.</p>

    saw Dr.&nbsp;Gilmour in his office on June&nbsp;9.  The incision had serious
    non&#8209;purulent discharge and redness around the area.  Dr.&nbsp;Gilmour
    did not think that there was an infection but decided to leave the staples
    in for a few more days and he instructed his patient to finish the oral antibiotic.</p>

    saw Dr.&nbsp;Gilmour again on June&nbsp;14 to remove the staples.  Dr.&nbsp;Gilmour
    observed dehiscence (separation of skin and tissue layers) and was very concerned
    that Ms.&nbsp;Aristorenas would develop an infection, as the edges of the
    skin were open.  He arranged for her to have home care nursing by Comcare,
    whose nurses would clean and monitor the wound.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Between
    June&nbsp;16 and 22, Ms.&nbsp;Aristorenas was cared for by seven Comcare
    nurses and was assessed 14 times.  Over the first five days, different nurses
    noted an escalating deterioration of the condition of the wound, including
    the presence of coloured discharge, itchiness, increased pain, and the presence
    of a foul smell.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    June&nbsp;21, Ms.&nbsp;Aristorenas went back to Dr.&nbsp;Gilmour’s office.  She
    carried with her a letter from one of the nurses recommending a change in
    the method of treatment.  Dr.&nbsp;Gilmour noted that there was purulent
    discharge from the wound and that some of the tissue was necrotic (dead).  He
    also noted a foul odour.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.&nbsp;Gilmour
    did not change the dressing on the wound.  He prescribed the same antibiotic
    as before.  Adopting a recommendation from a Comcare nurse, he ordered an
    increase in dressing frequency and prescribed intrasite gel for the wound
    area.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later
    on June&nbsp;21, a Comcare nurse visited Ms.&nbsp;Aristorenas.  She was concerned
    about the state of the wound and sought the opinion of a senior nurse.  The
    senior nurse, Lorna&nbsp;Thompson, saw Ms.&nbsp;Aristorenas the next day.  Nurse
    Thompson advised Ms.&nbsp;Aristorenas to go to the hospital immediately.  After
    arranging for child care, Ms.&nbsp;Aristorenas went back to the hospital.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    June&nbsp;23, a surgical debridement (removal of damaged tissue) of the wound

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    June&nbsp;24, Ms.&nbsp;Aristorenas’ temperature increased.  On June&nbsp;25,
    a further debridement was considered.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    June&nbsp;26, exploratory surgery was performed.  Ms.&nbsp;Aristorenas was
    diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis, a life&#8209;threatening infection.  Emergency
    surgery followed immediately.  An abdomen muscle was removed.  In a second
    operation,  a muscle from the patient’s right leg was removed and inserted
    in her abdomen.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.&nbsp;Aristorenas
    sued both Dr.&nbsp;Gilmour and Comcare in negligence for their supervision
    of her care and recovery from June 14 to June 21, 2000.  The trial judge
    heard testimony from ten witnesses during the six&#8209;day trial, including
    Ms.&nbsp;Aristorenas, Dr.&nbsp;Gilmour, several Comcare nurses, Dr.&nbsp;Parry&nbsp;Mayer,
    a family physician with expertise in the subject of wound care, Dr.&nbsp;Paul&nbsp;Bernstein
    and Dr.&nbsp;Mathias&nbsp;Gysler, obstetricians and gynaecologists, and Professor&nbsp;Margaret
    Wood, an expert with respect to nursing standards for wound care.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the treatment of Ms.&nbsp;Aristorenas by Dr.&nbsp;Gilmour
    and the Comcare nurse team fell below the accepted standard of care for their
    professions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning
    Dr.&nbsp;Gilmour, the trial judge found that his examination and treatment
    of Ms.&nbsp;Aristorenas on June&nbsp;21, 2000 was negligent:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The evidence
    establishes that Dr.&nbsp;Gilmour failed to recognize that conventional treatment
    was not assisting in the healing of this post&#8209;operative surgical wound.  At
    least by June&nbsp;21<sup>st</sup>, when he saw the plaintiff in his office,
    if not earlier, he noted that the plaintiff was exhibiting discharge from
    the wound.  It was observed to be large, purulent discharge and some of the
    tissue was necrotic.  The plaintiff was having a burning pain and there was
    the onset of a foul odour.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>This obvious
    marked deterioration of the wound site when compared with the chronology
    of the failed conventional treatments called out for an immediate debridement,
    either in Dr.&nbsp;Gilmour’s office or at the hospital.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I find that
    this failure constituted a breach of the standard of care of a reasonable
    and prudent medical doctor responding to post&#8209;operative symptoms.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also found that the Comcare nurses, collectively, were negligent
    in their treatment of Ms.&nbsp;Aristorenas:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In summary,
    the plaintiff entered home care with an obviously infected wound.  Her wound
    deteriorated.  There is little in the Comcare records to suggest that the
    nurses applied their knowledge of wound care and healing.  The nurses did
    not assess accurately or completely, did not document according to the standards
    expected, and did not promptly inform the supervisory physician of complications.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the causation issue, the trial judge applied the “robust and pragmatic approach” to
    fact finding in relation to causation set out in <i>Snell v. Farrell</i>,
    [1990] 2 S.C.R. 311 at 330, and concluded that “the plaintiff has established,
    on a balance of probabilities, that the defendants’ negligence materially
    contributed to the injury.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge assessed damages in this fashion:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The plaintiff
    faced death as a result of her encounter with necrotizing fasciitis.  She
    suffered through repeated surgical debridements which resulted in the removal
    of significant necrotic tissue from her abdomen.  She spent 10 days in the
    intensive care unit and suffered through considerable pain.  She also suffered
    severe anxiety in terms of fear for her own life and the future of her children.  She
    had to undergo significant skin and muscle grafts from her leg to her abdomen
    and she has been left with a large permanent scar on her abdomen and leg.  She
    was deprived of effective loss of her mother’s leave for post&#8209;natal
    bonding with her infant.  She went through a long period of rehabilitation.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>She was able
    to return to work approximately 6 months after the surgery at the point when
    she had significantly recovered from the result of the necrotizing fasciitis
    and corrective surgery.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In the circumstances,
    I assess general damages at $55,0000….</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    Dr.&nbsp;Gilmour and Comcare appeal the trial judge’s judgment.  However,
    they do so on only a single issue &#9472; causation.  They do not contest
    the trial judge’s findings of negligence against them or his assessment of
    damages.</p>

    458, and <i>Cottrelle v. Gerrard</i> (2003), 67 O.R. (3d) 737 (C.A.).</span></p>

    general principles relating to causation were succinctly summarized by
    Major&nbsp;J. in <i>Athey v. Leonati</i> at paras. 13&#8209;15:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Causation is
    established where the plaintiff proves to the civil standard on a balance
    of probabilities that the defendant caused or contributed to the injury:&nbsp; <i>Snell
    v. Farrell</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 311;<i> McGhee v. National Coal Board</i>,
    [1972] 3 All E.R. 1008 (H.L.).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The general,
    but not conclusive, test for causation is the “but for” test, which requires
    the plaintiff to show that the injury would not have occurred but for the
    negligence of the defendant:&nbsp;<i> Horsley v. MacLaren</i>, [1972] S.C.R.
    441.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The “but for”
    test is unworkable in some circumstances, so the courts have recognized that
    causation is established where the defendant’s negligence “materially contributed” to
    the occurrence of the injury: <i>Myers v. Peel County Board of Education</i>;
    [1981] 2 S.C.R. 21, <i>Bonnington Castings, Ltd. v. Wardlaw</i>, [1956]

    of the circumstances in which the “but for” test is potentially unworkable

    materially contributed to the injury.”  In answering this question, the trial
    judge adopted the “robust and pragmatic approach” to fact finding in relation

    necrotizing fasciitis, whose causes cannot be established with scientific
    certainty, the trial judge did not err in framing his inquiry in these terms.</p>

    This rare disease can be a complication of an infected wound.&nbsp; It is
    a matter of common sense that the negligence or delay on the part of the
    defendants allowed the wound to reach a complicated state and lead to rapid
    unpredictable consequences.&nbsp; There is absolutely no evidence to suggest

    did develop serious complications.&nbsp; One of those serious complications
    has a name, necrotizing fasciitis.&nbsp; The plaintiff was required to establish
    on a balance of probabilities that the defendants’ negligence would foreseeably
    result in a type of serious injury.&nbsp; However, the plaintiff was not
    required, particularly in a case such as this where the matter is not susceptible

    the real focus of the appellants’ attack on the trial judge’s reasons is
    his fourth proposition:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    disagree.  It is true that this link cannot be established to the level of
    scientific certainty.  However, this is precisely what the case law does <i>not</i> require.  As
    Sopinka&nbsp;J. explained in <i>Snell v. Farrell</i> at p.&nbsp;330, “an
    inference of causation may be drawn although positive or scientific proof
    of causation has not been adduced.”  See also <i>Athey v. Leonati</i> at

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is essentially what the trial judge did, especially in his fifth proposition:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    wound which was permitted to deteriorate due to the defendants’ lack of care,

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    acknowledge that it is possible that the necrotizing fasciitis arose from
    some cause unrelated to the Caesarian section wound.  It is also possible
    that it arose sometime between June&nbsp;9 and 15, before any of the appellants’ negligent
    treatment and care took place.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    these possibilities do not detract from the validity of the trial judge’s
    reasoning.  When the medical evidence (an untreated or mistreated infected
    wound can lead to serious complications; one possible complication is necrotizing
    fasciitis) is combined with the appellants’ conduct (negligent wound care
    for a week) and the result (rapidly deteriorating health and, ultimately,
    the onset of necrotizing fasciitis in the precise area of the infected, and
    mistreated, wound), the trial judge’s conclusion that Ms.&nbsp;Aristorenas
    had established causation on a balance of probabilities is supportable.  In
    any event, his conclusion is far removed from being a palpable and overriding
    error, especially when it is recalled that in <i>Snell v. Farrell</i>, at
    p.&nbsp;328, Sopinka&nbsp;J. was critical of a “too rigid application by
    the courts in many cases” of the traditional approach to causation, and in <i>Athey
    v. Leonati</i>, at para.&nbsp;16, Major&nbsp;J. instructed that “[t]he causation
    test is not to be applied too rigidly.”  In my view, the trial judge’s causation
    analysis in this case was faithful, in tone and substance, to these instructions.</p>

    (4<sup>th</sup>) 289 (S.C.C.), I am of the view that the trial judge erred
    in his articulation and application of that test.  Had the trial judge correctly

    that may be appropriate in cases such as this one.  The first is the generally
    applicable “but for” test whereby a plaintiff must “show that the injury

    however, provides little guidance as to when the
    “but for” test is unworkable and ought to be replaced by the “material contribution” test.  However,
    Sharpe J.A. examined the type of cases that warrant the adoption of the test
    at para. 30 of <i>Cottrelle</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In <i>Athey</i>,
    for example, the Supreme Court affirmed the “material contribution” test
    as a qualification to the strict “but for” test only when used in cases similar
    to <i>Bonnington Castings</i> and <i>McGhee v. National Coal Board</i>. The
    more recent House of Lords decision in <i>Fairchild v. Glenhaven Funeral
    Services Ltd</i>, also reflects this same tendency to depart from the “but
    for” standard, but only where the precise cause of the injury is unknown. <i>Bonnington,
    McGhee</i>, and <i>Fairchild</i> <u>all involved situations where the plaintiff
    was exposed to a harmful substance from various sources, but could not prove
    precisely that the substance resulting from the defendant’s tortious conduct
    caused the loss</u>. In <i>Fairchild</i>, the plaintiffs had been exposed
    to asbestos while working for various employers for various periods. The
    plaintiffs developed a fatal disease caused by asbestos, but could not establish
    which exposure or exposures to asbestos had actually caused the disease.
    ... <u>The salient feature of <i>Fairchild</i> was that the plaintiffs were
    definitely injured by the negligence of one of the defendants, and there
    was no other operative cause or explanation for the injury</u>. As pointed
    out in Lewis N. Klar, <i>Tort Law</i>: “courts will strive to fashion a just
    solution in this type of case to allow a wronged plaintiff to recover. Courts
    will not allow wronged plaintiffs to fall between the cracks due to the formal
    requirements of proving cause” [citations omitted and emphasis added]. </p>

    300-302:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I am of the
    opinion that the dissatisfaction with the traditional approach to causation
    stems to a large extent from its too rigid application by the courts in many
    cases.  Causation need not be determined by scientific precision.…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>In many malpractice cases, the facts lie particularly within
    the knowledge of the defendant.   In these circumstances, very little affirmative
    evidence on the part of the plaintiff will justify the drawing of an inference
    of causation in the absence of evidence to the contrary.  </p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The legal or
    ultimate burden remains with the plaintiff, but in the absence of evidence
    to the contrary adduced by the defendant, an inference of causation may be
    drawn although positive or scientific proof of causation has not been adduced.  If
    some evidence to the contrary is adduced by the defendant, the trial judge
    is entitled to take account of Lord Mansfield’s famous precept.  This is,
    I believe, what Lord Bridge had in mind in <i>Wilsher </i>when he referred
    to a “robust and pragmatic approach to the ... facts.”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It is not, therefore,
    essential that the medical experts provide a firm opinion supporting the
    plaintiff’s theory of causation. Medical experts ordinarily determine causation
    in terms of certainties whereas a lesser standard is demanded by the law.
    As pointed out in D.W. Louisell, <i>Medical Malpractice</i>, the phrase
    “in your opinion with a reasonable degree of medical certainty”, which is
    the standard form of question to a medical expert, is often misunderstood
    [citations omitted].</p>

    is important to note that Sopinka J. does not reduce the ultimate burden
    of proof from a balance of probabilities.  Rather, the “robust and pragmatic” approach
    is adopted in evaluating the facts of the case and deciding whether they
    meet the civil standard.  Put another way, the burden of proof is the same,
    but a series of facts and circumstances established by the evidence led at
    trial may enable the trial judge to draw an inference even though medical
    and scientific expertise cannot arrive at a definitive conclusion.</p>

    need not be determined by scientific precision; as Lord Salmon stated in <i>Alphacell
    Ltd. v. Woodward</i>, and as was quoted by Sopinka J., it is “essentially
    a practical question of fact which can best be answered by ordinary common
    sense”. Although the burden of proof remains with the plaintiff, in some

    this language does evoke a more “relaxed” standard to proving causation,
    it does not alter the requirement that the plaintiff must establish causation

    trial judge’s causation analysis hinges on his view that it “is a matter

    allowed the wound to reach a complicated state and lead to rapid unpredictable
    consequences”.  Despite the use of the phrase “negligence or delay”, causation
    in this case turned on the delay in treatment that resulted from the defendants’ negligence.  No
    other theory of causation was offered by the plaintiff.  It is important,
    therefore, to examine the facts as found by the trial judge and disclosed
    by the record to determine whether there is anything to support the proposition
    that the defendants’ delay caused or materially contributed to the plaintiff
    contracting necrotizing fasciitis.  The defendants’ negligence is now conceded.  The
    question is whether that negligence, which led to a delay in treatment, was
    a cause of the necrotizing fasciitis.</p>

    fasciitis was discovered in the plaintiff some twenty-six days after the

    the wound.  The trial judge found that the defendant doctor breached the
    standard of care when, on June 21, he neither debrided the wound nor sent
    the plaintiff to hospital.  Instead, the plaintiff was sent to hospital the
    next day, on June 22.  Thus, the negligence of the doctor resulted in a delay

    a doctor or to the hospital on June 19:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>But the nurses

    <li style='text-align:left;     '>Ms. Barton also gave evidence to the effect

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    only expert that was explicitly qualified to give evidence on necrotizing

    (other than it requires the presence of an infection<a href="#_ftn12"
name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[12]</span></a>) and
    that he did not think that anybody could provide its scientific cause.  Another
    one of the defendants’ experts, Dr.&nbsp;Gysler, testified on the standard
    of care applicable to obstetricians and gynaecologists.  He expressed the
    view that necrotizing fasciitis is “rare but not necessarily preventable.”  When
    the plaintiff asked him whether he considered himself an expert in necrotizing

    and contracting necrotizing fasciitis, no witness considered or gave evidence
    as to what effect the three-day delay in performing the first debridement
    had in this case.  This is the same omission that prevented a finding of
    causation in <i>Van Dyke v. Grey Bruce Regional Health Centre </i>(2005),
    255 D.L.R. (4th) 397 at para. 48 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused,
    [2005] S.C.C.A. No. 335.  In that case the court, at para. 48, stated as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Dr. Freeman’s
    evidence does not establish the necessary causal link between delay in stopping
    the administration of Gentamicin and Mr. Van Dyke’s damages. Dr. Freeman
    was not asked what effect, if any, a delay of two or three days would have
    on a person’s prospects for reversing, at least in part, the adverse consequences
    of vestibular toxicity. Dr. Freeman testified that the literature suggested
    a 50-50 chance of reversal if the Gentamicin was stopped when the symptoms
    appeared. He did not give any evidence as to how those statistics would be
    affected if the discontinuation of Gentamicin was delayed by two or three

    approach.  When compared to <i>Snell</i>, there is far less evidence and
    there are no additional factors to assist the court in reaching a finding
    of causation.  As indicated previously, the limited evidence about the impact
    of delay on wound care and infections was vague and general and, therefore,
    of little assistance.  On the facts of this case, there was a wide variety
    of possible causes of the necrotizing fasciitis:</p>

    assuming that the plaintiff’s theory of the case is correct and that a delay
    in treatment can cause or materially contribute to the contracting of necrotizing
    fasciitis, none of the evidence led at trial addresses whether in this case
    it was the delay in treatment or some other factor that caused the plaintiff
    to contract necrotizing fasciitis.  There are many theories of causation,
    and the evidence leaves us in a position where we do not know which one is
    correct or the most probable.  None of the evidence provided by the parties

    whether a “complicated state” is the same as the development of a specific “complication”.  The
    trial judge did not assess whether <i>this </i>delay caused <i>this </i>complication.  There
    are many unknown factors that could have been independent causes of the necrotizing
    fasciitis.  Eschewing scientific certainty does not eliminate the need for
    any evidence to support causation.  If causation can be inferred in the absence

    the defendants contributed to only three of the ten days of the known period

    hospital, the debridement was not carried out until the following day, suggesting
    that, at that point, the hospital staff did not consider it so urgent that
    the debridement needed to be done that day.  This lends further support to
    my view that the three day delay, even when it is coupled with the general
    statements made by unqualified experts to the effect that the chance of developing
    a variety of bacterial pathogens increases with the duration of the infection,
    are insufficient to support a finding of liability on a balance of probabilities.</p>

    otherwise and if it were sufficient to show merely loss of a chance, or to
    treat an increase in risk as equivalent to a material contribution, then

    defendants did not appeal the finding of negligence and, as a result, it
    is reasonable to conclude that they remain liable in damages for the pain
    and suffering of the plaintiff flowing from the delay in treatment caused
    by this negligence.  Although the statement of claim clearly focussed on
    the damages suffered as a result of contracting necrotizing fasciitis, damages
    for the pain and suffering flowing from the delay in treatment were, in my
    view, properly part of the claim.  The trial judge did not separately assess
    the damages flowing from the three-day delay as distinct from the damages
    suffered as a result of the necrotizing fasciitis.  Clearly the bulk of the
    general damages awarded by the trial judge is attributable to the necrotizing
    fasciitis.  As a result, I would vary the award of general damages to an
    award of $1,000.</p>
