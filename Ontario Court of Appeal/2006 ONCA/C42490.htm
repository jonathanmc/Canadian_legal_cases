  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the conviction
    entered by Justice Silja S. Seppi of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting
    with a jury, dated June 24, 2004.</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>LaFORME J.A.:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was charged with importing a prohibited
    substance, namely, cocaine.  At his
    trial he testified in his own defence and provided his explanation of the
    events that gave rise to the charge.  In
    essence, his testimony was as follows: he was left standing in the arrivals
    section at Pearson International Airport with a box containing four 1.14
    litre-sized liquor bottles.  Unbeknownst
    to him, these bottles contained $100,000 worth of cocaine.  The appellant was to give the bottles to a
    person unknown to him but with the name “Michael”.   He also testified that he had intentionally thrown out the only
    piece of paper containing the contact information for the man who had consigned
    these goods to him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jury found the appellant guilty of importing a prohibited
    substance.  He was sentenced to six
    years imprisonment.  He appeals only his
    conviction.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, a Canadian, testified that he flew to Antigua
    on a business trip.  A man named “Fred”,
    whom he had just met while playing golf in Antigua, had given him bottles of
    liquor to give to a friend of Fred’s in Canada who would be at the airport to
    meet him.  The appellant, who considered
    this to be a perfectly normal request for a local to make to a visitor, agreed.  Fred told the appellant that he had arranged
    for his friend to meet the appellant at the airport.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant said that he and Fred had exchanged telephone
    numbers in Antigua, although when the appellant subsequently tried the number,
    it was not in service.  The appellant
    carried the box containing the liquor bottles as personal luggage onto the
    plane. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On arrival in Toronto, the appellant presented a Customs
    Declaration Card, which declared that he was carrying five litres of
    alcohol.  This was in excess of the
    amount allowed and he was therefore referred to secondary customs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The secondary customs officer examined the liquor bottles and
    noticed that the seal on one of the bottles was broken.  The Custom’s officer testified that when he
    confronted the appellant with this observation: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>At that point [the
    appellant] began to sweat profusely, as soon as I showed him the bottle.  He seemed nervous.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Customs officer conducted a test on the substance in the
    liquor bottle, which proved to be cocaine.  He arrested the appellant for smuggling and contacted the R.C.M.P. who
    then took custody of the appellant.  The
    police officer’s evidence was:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>At the time Mr. Morales
    did appear quite nervous.  I did notice
    him sweating on the forehead, but other than that, his demeanour was all
    right.  He appeared nervous, but he was
    – he seemed to be okay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant testified that he threw out the phone number
    that he had been given for Fred.  He did
    this after he had been arrested and charged with importing cocaine, and after
    he had contacted a lawyer and discussed the phone number with him.  He claimed to have thrown the piece of paper
    out because the number was not real.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As previously noted, the liquor bottles contained
    approximately $100,000 worth of cocaine.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that the trial judge committed two
    errors that can be summarized as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1) The evidence of the appellant’s physical
    demeanour and utterances to Customs officers and police during the importation
    should not have been admitted.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) Wilful blindness ought not to have been left
    with the jury because: (i) there was no air of reality to it; and, or
    alternatively, (ii) the trial judge erred in her charge to the jury on wilful
    blindness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would dismiss the appeal for the reasons that follow.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE CONVICTON APPEAL</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>(1)            Demeanour Evidence:</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two key Crown witnesses testified that the appellant was
    sweating in an unusual manner.  The
    first was Customs Officer Seeley who questioned the appellant in the secondary
    inspection area.  The second was Police
    Constable Dhillon of the R.C.M.P. who later took custody of the appellant from
    the Customs Officer.  Each of them was
    fully cross-examined by defence counsel on this issue.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant relies primarily on the decision of
    Rosenberg J.A. in <i>R. v. Levert</i> (2001), 159 C.C.C. (3d) 71 (Ont. C.A.) to
    assert that the demeanour evidence in this case ought not to have been admitted
    because its probative value was outweighed by the prejudice to the
    appellant.  The Crown argues that the
    demeanour <span lang=EN-US>evidence in this
    case is contemporaneous with
    the offence and is therefore proper circumstantial evidence that the jury could
    consider in arriving at its verdict.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence of the Customs officer is not post-offence
    conduct; rather, it is some circumstantial evidence about the offender’s
    appearance and behaviour during the commission of the offence.  This
    court has held that this type of evidence by Customs officers can be admissible
    to establish that an accused person was aware of the contents in question: see <i>R.
    v. Goulart-Nelson</i> [2004] O.J. No. 4010 (C.A.). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assuming that the trial judge ought to have first ruled on the
    admissibility of the evidence, in the context of this case, the use of the
    evidence did not render the trial unfair.  I reach this conclusion for several reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, defence counsel made no objection to the admission of
    this evidence, and although this is not dispositive of the issue, it is a
    factor to consider.  Second, the
    appellant gave evidence explaining his innocent reasons for his demeanour, and
    much of his evidence in this regard was confusing and vague.  It no doubt impacted on the jury’s
    assessment of his credibility.  Third,
    defence counsel vigorously challenged the veracity of the evidence that the
    appellant was sweating.  Counsel
    attacked this evidence as being tainted and given by witnesses with an interest
    in the outcome of the case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, <span lang=EN-US>the jury was fully and properly instructed by the trial judge on
    reasonable doubt and the treatment of the appellant’s evidence pursuant to <i>R. v. S.(W.D.)</i> (1994), 93 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).  The trial judge’s charge on the evidence of the appellant’s
    reaction was full, fair and balanced.  She accurately summarized the evidence and drew the jury’s attention to
    the competing inferences the parties suggested should be drawn from it.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before leaving this, I would add that, had the
    admissibility of the evidence been challenged, the trial judge ought to have
    considered the concerns expressed by Rosenberg J.A. in <i>Levert</i>.  <i>Levert</i> was a case that involved
    evidence of the accused person’s demeanour when the young complainant’s foster
    mother and her husband confronted him with sexual assault allegations.  Rosenberg J.A. noted that the evidence in
    that case could only be relevant to post-offence conduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Levert</i>, Rosenberg J.A. concluded that
    evidence of “adoption by silence” by an accused person should be approached
    with caution.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-family:Arial;
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>[1]</span></span></a>  He goes on to hold that the inference drawn
    from this type of demeanour evidence is based on perceptions of how an accused
    person should respond in what are often extreme and unusual circumstances.  Such perceptions might well be inaccurate,
    and consequently the probative value of the evidence may be low and its
    potential prejudicial effect high.  It
    seems to me that the faulty inferences that may be made from a person’s
    post-offence conduct can apply equally to other circumstances, such as those in
    this case.<span lang=EN-US>  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However,
    in the circumstances of this case, for the reasons I have given I am not
    satisfied that the use of the evidence rendered the trial unfair.  Accordingly, this ground of appeal is dismissed.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>(2)            Wilful Blindness:</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge acceded to the Crown’s request to leave wilful
    blindness with the jury as an alternative <i>mens rea</i> to the appellant’s
    actual knowledge that he was importing cocaine.  The appellant argues that there was no air of reality to the
    Crown’s theory of wilful blindness and that it was an error for the trial judge
    to leave it with the jury.  Thus, as the
    jury could have relied on wilful blindness to convict, this amounts to an unreasonable
    verdict and the conviction ought to be quashed.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US>(i)            Air of reality:</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn first to the issue of air of reality.  The question in the context of this case is:
    could a properly instructed jury acting reasonably find that the appellant was
    wilfully blind to the fact that he was carrying cocaine?  See <i>R. v. Cinous</i> (2002), 162 C.C.C.
    (3d) 129 (S.C.C.) at para. 47.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For wilful blindness to be established, the Crown need
    only prove that the failure to inquire was motivated or informed by a desire to
    avoid the truth, or knowledge on the part of the accused that avoiding an
    inquiry will shield his eyes and ears from the guilty truth: see <i><span lang=EN-US>R. v. Lagace</span></i><span lang=EN-US> (2003), 181 C.C.C. (3d) 12 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 28.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant himself admitted that taking the box of bottles
    from Fred “looks stupid”.  The appellant
    testified he met Fred while on a business trip to Antigua.  He did not know Fred’s last name, but agreed
    to Fred’s request to take liquor back to Canada for Fred’s friend.  His evidence also included such things as:
    he had only the name “Michael” as a delivery contact and no address or phone
    number for Michael; and he had no description of Michael and no way to contact
    Michael even though he was in possession of property for Michael.  There is more such similarly vague evidence
    of the appellant; however, for purposes of this decision these examples will
    suffice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, it was open to the jury to ask whether the
    appellant’s “being stupid” or “looking stupid” in all the circumstances as
    described by him that resulted in the commission<i> </i>of a serious criminal offence, was as a
    result of his wilful blindness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s evidence revealed inherently suspicious events
    with details that were unclear and defied common sense.  In these circumstances the jury was entitled
    to believe some, all or none of his evidence and, in doing so, wilful blindness
    became an issue.  The appellant’s
    evidence alone was capable of supporting a finding of deliberate
    ignorance.  It was open to the jury to
    find that the appellant must have suspected that there was more than just
    liquor being taken back to Canada, but declined to make inquiries that would
    confirm his suspicions, preferring to remain ignorant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, there was an air of reality to wilful
    blindness.  I turn next to the trial
    judge’s charge to the jury on wilful blindness.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US>(ii)            Jury charge:</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s argument centres on the trial judge’s use of
    the word “perhaps”.  In essence, he
    submits that by using the word “perhaps” as she did in her charge, the trial
    judge may have undermined the burden of proof and invited the jury to speculate
    about this crucial issue.  I disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The actual phrase she uses is “perhaps when”, which she
    repeats several times.  It is obvious to
    me, when one considers the whole of her instructions, that she does so to
    relate the various times at which to consider the issue of wilful blindness,
    and not in regard to the burden of proof.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only questions from the jury were: “What is the basis of
    wilful blindness?  Is it based on a
    reasonable person or is it based on Mr. Morales”?  The trial judge, with the agreement of all counsel, instructed
    the jury: “The basis of wilful blindness for you to consider in this trial is
    Mr. Morales state of mind”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, the jury obviously disbelieved the appellant’s evidence that he had nothing to gain
    from importation of the cocaine.  In the
    context of the jury’s question and the trial judge’s answer, the trial judge
    correctly conveyed the essential subjective nature of wilful blindness to the
    jury.  The trial judge’s charge on
    wilful blindness was complete and accurate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would therefore also reject this ground of appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>DISPOSITION</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
