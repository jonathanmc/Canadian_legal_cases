      of Justice Halikowski of the Ontario Court of Justice dated September 11,
      2003.</span></h4>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in refusing an adjournment when
    the appellant attended on the trial date with counsel who had just been retained
    a day or two before the trial date.  Counsel requested an adjournment so
    that he might adequately prepare to defend the appellant.  The appellant
    also submits that having forced the appellant on without counsel, the trial
    judge did not provide the assistance to the appellant needed to ensure a
    fair trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    need not go into the procedural background of this case.  It may well be
    that the trial judge should have made further inquiries as to the relevant
    circumstances and the length of the adjournment requested before refusing
    the adjournment.  In the end however, we are satisfied that the refusal of
    the adjournment compromised neither the fairness of the trial nor the appearance
    of the fairness of the trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the trial judge refused an adjournment, the Crown called its case.  The Crown
    called two witnesses – the complainant and his mother.  The appellant cross-examined
    both witnesses.  After the Crown’s case was complete, the trial judge adjourned
    the trial for four months.  When the matter returned to court some four months
    later, the appellant had retained counsel.  Counsel had been provided on
    the order of the court with a transcript of the earlier proceedings and a
    copy of the Crown’s disclosure.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the trial recommenced, the appellant testified with the assistance of counsel.  Counsel
    was allowed a further adjournment of about six weeks so that he could recall
    the complainant’s mother who had testified during the case for the Crown.  Counsel
    did not make any request to recall the complainant, the only other witness
    called by the Crown.  Counsel did not challenge the ruling allowing what
    would appear to be a relatively unimportant amendment to the information.  Counsel
    did not request a mistrial.  Counsel did adduce further defence evidence
    and did make submissions on behalf of the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
    claims had been advanced in this court that defence counsel did not provide
    effective assistance to the appellant at trial.  Indeed, the trial judge
    ultimately found that two of the three factual allegations made by the complainant
    had not been proved.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Our
    review of the record does not suggest anything that counsel could reasonably
    have been expected to do that could have affected the result.  Moreover,
    we are satisfied that the appearance of fairness was maintained.  In that
    regard, we note that after refusing the adjournment, the trial judge did
    grant a lengthy adjournment at the end of the Crown’s case so that the appellant
    could retain counsel for the purpose of assisting him in his own defence.  The
    trial judge took effective steps to ensure that counsel who was retained
    receive full disclosure and a transcript of the evidence of the two Crown
    witnesses.  The trial judge not only allowed trial counsel to recall one
    of the Crown witnesses but granted a further adjournment so that the witness
    could be brought to court.  We have no reason to think that the trial judge
    would have refused any reasonable request to further cross-examine the complainant
    had counsel believed it was necessary.  The overall conduct of the proceedings
    overcomes any perceived unfairness flowing from the denial of the adjournment
    request after what might be described as an inadequate inquiry by the trial
    judge.</p>
