style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The appellants
    operated a mail fraud scheme that involved sending invoices to thousands
    of businesses and non-profit organizations in Canada purporting to be for
    the renewal of a listing in an Internet Yellow Pages business directory.
    The problem was that the recipients were not existing customers of the directory,
    which had just been started, but were misled into paying for the “renewal” of
    the listing by threats of late payment charges and by the assertion that
    these were in fact renewals, when they were not. The revenues generated by
    five mailings between May and December 2000 exceeded $1.1 million. Following
    a twenty-two-day jury trial, the appellants were found guilty of misleading
    advertising, contrary to s. 52(1) of the <i>Competition Act,</i><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:black;'> </span>R.S.C. 1985, c. C-34, s. 52, as
    am. by S.C. 1999, c. 2, s. 12. This appeal involves their sentences of a
    lengthy jail term as well as a significant fine.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The appellants
    are brothers. Alan and Elliot Benlolo were principals in the Internet business
    directories called yellowbusinesspages.com and yellowbusinessdirectory.com.
    On May 25, 2000, they sent out their first mailing of invoices to approximately
    50,000 businesses and non-profit organizations. The invoice was sent to recipients
    who had no relationship with the new business, yet the invoice did not describe
    the product in any way. Each mailing bore a striking similarity to a Bell
    Canada invoice, with almost the identical format, font and layout, including
    a two-sided format and detachable lower portion. It also contained a close
    facsimile of the Yellow Pages walking fingers logo. The amount due was stated
    to be $25.52, payable on receipt, with a late payment charge if payment was
    received after June 24, 2000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      After the May
    mailing, Victor Serfaty became involved. He was charged jointly with the
    Benlolos but did not appeal his conviction or sentence. On July 6, 2000,
    the Competition Bureau sent a warning letter to Mr. Serfaty that the May
    mailing raised concerns regarding misleading representations and deceptive
    practices in contravention of the <i>Competition Act</i>. Additionally, shortly
    after the first mailing took place, solicitors for Telus Pages in British
    Columbia wrote yellowbusinesspages.com to demand that the latter cease using
    a reversed version of the walking fingers logo on its invoices.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      On July 25, 2000,
    the second mailing was sent to 100,000 businesses and non-profit organizations
    in Canada. The second mailing was a somewhat modified version of the May
    mailing. Although it no longer contained the walking fingers logo associated
    with the Yellow Pages directory, it included the fact that there was no charge
    for the initial listing and set-up and continued to refer to a balance forward,
    account number and other references that suggested to the recipient that
    it was a renewal notice. The word “bill” remained on the form.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The third mailing
    on August 24, 2000 was sent out to 222,691 businesses and non-profit organizations,
    and the fourth on September 24, 2000 was sent to 288,015 such recipients.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      As a result of
    this continued activity by the appellants and Mr. Serfaty in the face of
    a warning from the Competition Bureau, together with a record number of consumer
    complaints (over 4,400 in total), the Competition Bureau as well as Canada
    Post took enforcement action. On October 24 and 25, 2000, the Competition
    Bureau executed nine search warrants at locations associated with the appellants
    and their companies, and on November 24, 2000, Alan and Elliot Benlolo and
    Victor Serfaty and their companies were charged with violations of the <i>Competition
    Act</i> in relation to the May, July, August and September 2000 mailings.
    On December 6, 2000, the Canada Post Corporation issued an interim prohibitory
    order under s. 43 of the <i>Canada Post Corporation Act, </i><span class=documentbody>R.S.C.
    1985, c. C-10, </span>prohibiting Alan and Elliot Benlolo and Victor Serfaty
    and their company from sending or receiving mail from specified addresses
    associated with their Internet business directory.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a><i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      After these charges
    and the prohibitory order were made, the fifth mailing was sent out on December
    15, 2000. The appellant Simon Benlolo, a third brother, had worked in the
    office of yellowbusinesspages.com since at least July 2000. On November&nbsp;2,
    2000, eight days after the search warrants were executed, he incorporated
    a “clean” Ontario numbered corporation to carry on the directory’s activities.
    At that time, he also opened two bank accounts as the president and secretary
    of the new company. The December mailing was a bilingual bill similar in
    content to the previous mailings, but the price was raised to $37.40 and
    it was sent out only in Quebec to 225,331 businesses and non-profit organizations.
    Alan and Elliot Benlolo and Victor Serfaty were charged in connection with
    this last mailing and eventually Simon Benlolo was charged in connection
    with all five mailings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      On April 23, 2004,
    following a twenty-two-day jury trial at which the appellants did not testify,
    Alan and Elliot Benlolo were convicted of two counts of misleading advertising
    in relation to each of the five mailings, that is of “knowingly or recklessly”
    making a representation to the public that was false or misleading in a material
    way, contrary to s.&nbsp;52(1) of the <i>Competition Act</i>. Simon Benlolo
    was convicted of two counts of misleading advertising in relation to the
    December 15, 2000 mailing only. Victor Serfaty was convicted of two counts
    in connection with each of the July, August, September and December mailings.
    The matter was put over for sentencing until July 22, 2004.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      On that date,
    the appellants Alan and Elliot Benlolo pled guilty before the same trial
    judge to another very serious offence of conspiracy to commit fraud on the
    public and a joint sentence submission was made and accepted in respect of
    that offence. The two appellants were principals in an international telemarketing
    stock swap scheme between September 10, 1997 and September 27, 2000, overlapping
    the same period when they were also engaged in this misleading advertising
    Yellow Pages invoice scam. The scheme was carried out through a two-stage
    operation. In the first stage, people in many countries were contacted and
    convinced to buy shares in a number of small capital companies, the values
    of which had been artificially inflated. The investors were led to believe
    they had dealt with a legitimate brokerage firm, which later went out of
    business after the shares fell in value. In the second stage, the appellants
    and co-conspirators approached the same investors in the guise of other <i>bona
    fide</i> brokerages and told them that the small capital companies now wished
    to privatize and that the brokerages would repurchase the stock at a premium
    if the victims purchased blue chip stocks from them at below market value.
    The victims sent the difference in value to the conspirators. The victims
    never received the stock they bought. More than two hundred victims lost
    several million dollars.</p>

line-height:normal;'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    July 22 and 23, counsel made their sentence submissions with respect to the <i>Competition
    Act</i> convictions and the matter was put over for sentencing until October
    1, 2004. In conjunction with the guilty pleas on the fraud, counsel for the
    appellants and for the Crown agreed on a joint submission for sentence of
    forty-two months in jail for each of Alan and Elliot Benlolo together with
    a joint restitution order in the full amount of $1,498,000 on condition that
    $920,000 would be paid into court on October 1, 2004. Both Alan and Elliot
    Benlolo had criminal records. Elliot Benlolo had been convicted of trafficking
    in a significant quantity of cocaine in 1993 and received a sentence of two
    years less a day. Alan Benlolo had no Canadian record, but in 1998 he was
    convicted in the United States of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud.
    He was sentenced to a period of eighteen months in jail that was reduced
    to six months, and to a $400,000 restitution order that has not been paid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his sentence submissions at trial, the position of counsel for the appellants
    was that the penalty should be a fine only. The Crown asked for three years
    in prison together with a fine of $400,000 for each of Alan and Elliot Benlolo,
    with the sentence to be served concurrently with the forty-two months on
    the fraud charges. For Simon Benlolo, the Crown asked for a conditional sentence
    of one year and a fine of $100,000.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Alan
    and Elliot Benlolo were each sentenced to thirty-four months imprisonment,
    after credit for two months pretrial custody, together with a $400,000 fine.
    The term of imprisonment was to be served concurrently with the forty-two-month
    term for conspiracy to commit fraud in relation to the stock swap scheme.
    On those charges, Molloy J. acceded to the joint submission of counsel for
    a sentence of forty-two months together with a joint restitution order of
    $1.498 million, with the forty-two months to be served concurrently with
    the sentence imposed for the <i>Competition Act</i> convictions. The appellants
    were given six years to pay the fine with an additional year in default of
    payment.<a

    appellants submit that the trial judge erred in law by imposing significant
    jail sentences that are outside the range for the offence of misleading advertising.
    The appellants rely on case law under the former misleading advertising offence
    in s. 36 of the <i>Combines Investigation Act, </i><span class=documentbody>S.C.
    1974-75-76, c. 76</span>, and s. 52 of the <i>Competition Act</i>, R.S.C.
    1985, c. C-34, before it was amended in 1999. At that time Parliament made
    two significant changes to the <i>Act</i>: 1) it changed the misleading advertising
    offence from a strict liability offence to a full <i>mens rea</i> offence,
    and 2) it added provisions that could be used by the Competition Bureau for
    civil enforcement to stop misleading advertising business practices without
    the need to resort to the criminal law. In proceedings before Parliament
    when the legislative changes were made, the Minister articulated the purpose
    of the changes as follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The changes
    before us will create a combination criminal/civil regime to address misleading
    advertising and deceptive marketing practices. They will foster quick and
    efficient compliance through a series of measures that allow a great deal
    of flexibility. This flexibility will enable the Competition Bureau to tailor
    its approach and to use the tools that are most effective for each different
    situation. Criminal sanctions will remain in place, but only for the most
    serious cases of misleading advertising.<a

    to the March 11, 1999 amendments, the section did not include the <i>mens
    rea</i> requirement that the representation be made “knowingly or recklessly”.
    Instead, a due diligence defence applied. The available penalties if the
    offence was prosecuted by indictment were not changed, but in the case of
    a summary conviction offence, the maximum fine was raised from $25,000 to
    $200,000 with the maximum one year in jail remaining unchanged.</p>

line-height:normal;'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior
    to the amendments, misleading advertising was regarded and treated as a regulatory
    offence. In <i>R. v. Wholesale Travel Group Inc.</i> (1991), 67 C.C.C. (3d)
    193 at 238 (S.C.C.), Cory J. stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The objective
    of regulatory legislation is to protect the public or broad segments of the
    public (such as employees, consumers and motorists, to name but a few) from
    the potentially adverse effects of otherwise lawful activity. </p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left'>Although a sentence of incarceration
    was available under the former provision, courts tended to impose fines rather
    than custodial sentences for this and other offences under the <i>Competition
    Act</i>. Obviously when the charged entity is a corporation, the only penalty
    available is a fine with distress of property in default. Many of the older
    cases involved corporations only. See, for example, <i>R. v. Simpsons Ltd</i>.
    (1989), 25 C.P.R. (3d) 43 (Ont. Dist. Ct.), <i>R.. v. Browning Arms Co. of
    Canada Ltd</i>. (1974), 18 C.C.C. (2d) 298 (Ont. C.A.), <i>R.. v. Hudson’s
    Bay Co</i>. (1977), 35 C.C.C. (2d) 61 (Ont. C.A.). However, in the case of <i>R..
    v. Tobe</i> (1978), 43 C.P.R. (2d) 51 (Ont. Co. Ct.), where the accused was
    an individual, a fine was imposed with one year in jail in the event of default.
    In other words, although a fine was the imposed penalty, in parity with the
    cases involving corporations, the court viewed an order of incarceration
    in default as appropriate.</p>

    deciding that a substantial sentence of incarceration was warranted and appropriate
    in this case, the trial judge distinguished the pre-1999 case law. She concluded
    that in making the amendments, Parliament intended that serious, egregious
    cases that had the hallmarks of fraud would be treated as criminal matters,
    while the cases that were more akin to sharp practice could be processed
    through the new civil stream. I agree with the trial judge that the 1999
    amendments constitute a watershed in the treatment and approach to misleading
    advertising and that the pre-1999 case law must therefore be viewed with
    caution.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    this was a jury trial, the trial judge was entitled to make findings based
    on the jury’s verdict that were necessary for the purpose of sentencing under
    s. 724(2)(b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. The trial judge found that “this
    entire enterprise was a scam designed to bilk unsuspecting recipients of
    these fake invoices.” Although a web site with business listings did exist,
    the trial judge viewed it as a ruse to provide a cover for the fraudulent
    activity, which was tricking unsuspecting recipients of the “invoice” or “bill” into
    thinking that their business or non-profit corporation was a subscriber of
    the Yellow Pages Internet directory and that they were therefore obliged
    to pay for that subscription. The fake invoices constituted the sole income
    stream of this business. In light of these conclusions, the trial judge rejected
    the suggestion that the appellants’
    conduct was just an example of a legitimate business overreaching, similar
    to the earlier cases such as the <i>Simpsons </i>case. Rather, the conduct
    was “much further along the continuum towards criminal fraud,” making the
    election by the Competition Bureau to proceed by way of indictment completely
    appropriate in order to engage the higher available penalties. The fact that
    the invoiced amount in each case was small likely contributed to the success
    of the operation, causing the clerks who received the invoices to give them
    less scrutiny. The magnitude of the crime is measured both in the hundreds
    of thousands of mailings and in the revenue generated of over $1 million. </p>

    trial judge concluded that a significant sentence was required in order to
    denounce this kind of conduct and to demonstrate that this type of misleading
    advertising on a large scale is not merely unethical, but criminal. It undermines
    the Canadian economy that operates on the premise and understanding that
    consumer business dealings entered into in good faith are legitimate.</p>

    this context the trial judge found that each of the four accused required
    a custodial sentence. The trial judge considered the issue of disparity that
    was raised by the recent disposition of two cases involving Peter Kuryliw
    and James Tetaka. These two had purchased the Yellow Pages Internet business
    from the appellants and had continued to operate it in the same misleading
    way after December 2000. Each pled guilty and, on a joint submission, received
    a fine. Without commenting on the propriety of those sentences, they were
    based on guilty pleas and a joint submission. In fact, in the Tetaka case,
    the trial judge was faced with the precedent of the Kuryliw case and felt
    bound to honour the disparity principle. I agree with the trial judge that
    the result in cases where there is a guilty plea and a joint submission cannot
    be taken as precedential. The trial judge also pointed out that Kuryliw and
    Tetaka were not the originators of the fraudulent scheme. Although this is
    not a significant difference, the trial judge was entitled to take it into
    account.</p>

    trial judge also referred to Alan and Elliot Benlolos’
    other criminal activity. Alan Benlolo had a record in the U.S. for mail fraud
    and was barely out of jail when he began both this offence and the stock
    swap fraud. Contrary to the evidence given by the character witnesses on
    his behalf, the trial judge observed that Alan Benlolo was not interested
    in “making an honest living”.  Elliot Benlolo had a somewhat dated record
    for conspiracy to traffic in a large amount of cocaine for which he had received
    a sentence of two years less a day. In his case, he was out of prison for
    only a few years when he became engaged in planning this criminal activity
    and the stock swap. The trial judge concluded that although Elliot Benlolo’s
    record was less relevant than Alan Benlolo’s, they acted together in this
    crime and deserved the same sentence.</p>

    with the forty-two-month sentence for fraud as well as a fine of $400,000
    for both Alan and Elliot Benlolo. I will deal with the propriety of the fine
    later in these reasons. The trial judge agreed that a significant term of
    imprisonment was required in order to meet the objectives of specific and
    general deterrence as well as denunciation. She observed that this was not
    the worst case warranting the maximum five-year sentence, but as it was at
    the upper end of the scale, three years was appropriate.</p>

    Mr. Serfaty and Simon Benlolo also received custodial sentences but they
    were to be served in the community. The trial judge explained that the seriousness
    of the crime and the need for specific and general deterrence to demonstrate
    how seriously the court views such offences made a fine an inadequate sentence
    for these crimes in these egregious circumstances. The deliberate flouting
    of the law by proceeding in December in the face of search warrants executed
    and charges already laid in respect of the earlier mailings significantly
    contributed to this conclusion.</p>

    Benlolo received a nine-month conditional sentence. He was thirty-two years
    old and had no criminal record. Although he was involved with his older brother
    Alan in the mail fraud scheme in the United States, he was very young at
    the time and was diverted from the criminal law system. In this case the
    trial judge treated him as a first offender. Because of his more limited
    involvement in the business directory venture as found by the jury, the trial
    judge was satisfied that although a custodial sentence was required, a sentence
    of nine months to be served in the community was appropriate together with
    a fine of $100,000.</p>

    importantly, the trial judge made no error in principle in imposing significant
    custodial sentences for the offence of misleading advertising. Prior to the
    1999 amendments, the same five-year maximum jail term was available as a
    penalty. However, because the offence was viewed as regulatory rather than
    fully criminal, and because many of the significant prosecutions were against
    corporations, jail sentences were not traditionally imposed. Another significant
    factor was that generally the crimes that came before the court involved
    legitimate businesses that stepped over the line in promoting their products
    and were most often limited to a particular advertising campaign. <i></i></p>

    1999, Parliament amended the legislation to give the Competition Bureau more
    tools to use and more flexibility in its choice of enforcement mechanisms
    to combat new forms of misleading advertising including large-scale fraudulent
    schemes. It now had civil remedies that were more easily obtainable to deal
    with persons whose activities could be curbed and regulated through directives
    that would protect the public without the need to engage in the acrimonious,
    time-consuming and onerous criminal prosecution process. On the other hand,
    the criminal offence was changed from a strict liability offence to one of
    full <i>mens rea</i>, that is, where the deception is done knowingly or with
    reckless disregard of the consequences. In the text <i>Competition Law of
    Canada,</i> the authors discuss the new criminal provision at para. 6.02[3]:<i></i></p>

    of misleading representation where there is clear and compelling evidence

    As a result of the recent amendments, s. 52(1) requires proof that the misleading
    advertising occurred knowingly or recklessly. To determine whether a criminal
    prosecution would be in the public interest, the Commissioner may consider

    summary accompanying Bill C-13 reads: </p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>“Bill C-13 is part of the federal government’s response
    to the recent spate of corporate scandals that have plagued the United States
    and weakened investor confidence in capital markets around the world. Scandals
    associated with companies such as Enron, WorldCom, Tyco and ImClone have
    precipitated calls to strengthen corporate governance standards and better
    enforce laws governing capital markets activities.</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>…</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>B. Increasing Penalties for Existing Fraud Offences</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>Clause 2 increases the maximum prison sentences for
    the existing offences of fraud and fraud affecting the public market under
    section 380 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> from 10 to 14 years.</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>Under clause 4, the maximum term of imprisonment for
    market manipulation offences is increased from 5 to 10 years. Covered in
    section 382 of the Code, market manipulation involves practices that create
    a market for securities that has little or no bearing on their actual value.
    It includes activities such as wash sales, where there are a purchase and
    sale but no change in the beneficial ownership of a security; and matched
    orders, where a purchase order and a sale order for a security, of substantially
    the same size and at substantially the same time and same price, are entered
    by either the same person or two different persons.</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>New section 380.1 (clause 3) establishes four aggravating
    circumstances that a court can consider when imposing a sentence for market
    fraud offences. These are as follows:</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    amount involved in the fraud exceeded $1 million;</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    offence adversely affected (or had the potential to adversely affect) the
    stability of the Canadian economy or financial system or any financial market
    in Canada or investor confidence in such a market;</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>large
    numbers of victims were involved; and</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    perpetrator took advantage of his or her elevated status or reputation in
    the community in committing the offence.</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>The presence of these factors will enable a court
    to impose tougher penalties.” </p>
