    for treatment. </p>

    Halton Region Childrens Aid Society (Halton CAS) apprehended R.D., obtained 
    an order that she was a child in need of protection, and placed her at the 
    Syl Apps Secure Treatment Centre (Syl Apps). The family of R.D. sued Syl 
    Apps, one of Syl Apps social workers, Douglas Baptiste, and one of Syl Apps 
    doctors, Richard Meen, for damages for negligence and bad faith in their dealings 
    with the family.</p>

    not been reintegrated with her family. The defendants brought a motion under 
    r. 21.01(1)(b) to dismiss the plaintiffs claim as disclosing no reasonable 
    cause of action. Hoilett J. granted the motion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

    do not think that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs claim will 
    fail. The duties asserted are novel. The governing legislation, the <i>Child 
    and Family Services Act,</i> R.S.O. 1990, c. C-11 (CFSA), the terms of the 
    various court orders affecting R.D., and the application of the <i>Anns </i>test, 
    suggest that Syl Apps and Baptiste may owe a duty of care to R.D.s family. 
    I would permit the claim to go forward. </p>

    not a party to this action. In their amended statement of claim, the plaintiffs 
    allege that R.D. was apprehended by the Halton CAS in June 1995 when she was 
    fourteen years old. She was apprehended because she wrote a short story at 
    school in which she alleged that her parents physically and sexually abused 
    her. The plaintiffs claim that the story was fictional and that R.D.s allegations 
    of abuse are false. They say that R.D. is delusional, which is consistent 
    with a history of mental illness in the family. Although the Halton Regional 
    Police investigated R.D.s allegations of abuse, no criminal charges were 
    ever laid against the plaintiffs. And no court has ever found that R.D.s 
    parents abused their daughter.</p>

    January 1995, the Halton CAS was granted interim wardship of R.D. In September 
    1995, R.D.s allegations of abuse were tried before Judge Fuller of the Ontario 
    Court (Provincial Division). He found that R.D. was a child in need of protection 
    because she had suffered or was likely to suffer emotional harm, not because 
    her parents had sexually abused her. The plaintiffs allege that Judge Fuller 
    effectively found that R.D. was in need of protection from herself, not from 
    her parents. He ordered that R.D. be made a temporary ward of Halton CAS, 
    but that efforts be made to reintegrate her with her family. The order stipulated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3. There will be a monthly meeting arranged between 
    the Society, service providers or their representatives and parents.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4. Prior to the child being moved to another facility, 
    all relevant parties including parents, the childs lawyer and Dr. Yaraskevsky 
    will be informed and their input received.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5. Parents will be able to have information from

    the plaintiffs has summarized the allegations against Syl Apps and Baptiste 
    in the amended statement of claim as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'><u>Allegations 
    Against Syl Apps:</u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a) That Syl Apps, as a secure treatment facility, 
    was under a duty [to the Appellants] to provide competent diagnosis, care 
    and treatment for [R.D.] and that failure to do so resulted in R.D.s inability 
    to be reintegrated with her family;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>b) that Syl Apps failed to follow the judicial direction 
    of reintegration of R.D. back into her family and resisted the recognition 
    of R.D.s familys right to information about her which resulted in the failure 
    of R.D. to be reintegrated with her family;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>c) that Syl Apps failed to provide R.D. with appropriate 
    care and treatment which resulted in the failure of R.D.s reintegration with 
    her family; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>d) Syl Apps negligent conclusion that R.D.s parents 
    were child abusers and their treatment of R.D. as the victim of abuse rather 
    than of an organic psychiatric disorder caused the failure of R.D. to be reintegrated 
    with her family.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'><u>Allegations 
    Against Baptiste</u>: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>a) that, as a 
    social worker at Syl Apps, Baptiste was under a duty [to the Appellants] 
    to discharge his responsibilities competently and in good faith, and in accordance 
    with applicable legislation;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>b) that Baptiste 
    failed to follow the judicial direction of reintegration of R.D. back into 
    her family and resisted the recognition of R.D.s familys right to information 
    about her which resulted in the failure of R.D. to be reintegrated with her 
    family;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>c) that Baptiste 
    in bad faith discouraged R.D. from having a relationship with the Appellants 
    on the unfounded basis that R.D.s parents had abused her;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>d) that Baptiste 
    led R.D. to believe the Appellants sought to harm her with the result that 
    reintegration failed;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>e) that Baptistes 
    decision to treat R.D. on the assumption she had been abused by her parents 
    destroyed the possibility of successful reintegration; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>f) that Baptiste 
    recommended R.D. be placed in a group home for victims of abuse after her 
    discharge from Syl Apps rather than be reintegrated with her family without 
    grounds for the assumption of abuse.</p>

    </span> In their action, in addition to suing Syl Apps, Baptiste, and Meen, 
    the plaintiffs sued the Halton CAS, several of its employees, and Dr. Alina 
    Lazor, who allegedly treated R.D. at the Whitby Mental Health Centre. The 
    action continues against Halton CAS and its employees. However, Syl Apps, 
    Baptiste, Meen, and Lazor brought motions<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>to dismiss the claims against them, contending that they owed no duty 
    of care to the plaintiffs. The motion judge agreed. He concluded that the 
    two doctors, Meen and Lazor, owed a duty of care to their patient R.D., and 
    to no one else. He then concluded that the plaintiffs claim against Syl Apps 
    and Baptiste could stand on no better footing than their claim against the 
    doctors. As I have already said, the plaintiffs appeal only the dismissal 
    of their claim against Syl Apps and Baptiste. </p>
  <h1><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'>C. ANALYSIS</span></h1>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> This test to strike a statement of claim on a r. 21.01(1)(b) motion 
    is well known. The moving party must meet a very high threshold. It must show 
    that it is plain and obvious that the claim does not disclose a cause of 
    action: see <i>Hunt v. Carey</i> <i>Canada Inc.,</i> [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959. 
    The court should be wary of foreclosing novel claims at the pleading stage. 
  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> To succeed in their action in negligence against Syl Apps and Baptiste, 
    the plaintiffs must first establish that these defendants owed them a duty 
    of care. This court has refused to interfere with a trial judges finding 
    that a childrens aid society owed a duty of care to the father of children 
    it had apprehended because of sexual abuse allegations: see <i>D.B. v. Childrens 
    Aid</i> <i>Society of Durham Region</i> (1996), 136 D.L.R. (4th) 297 (Ont. 
    C.A.). However, whether a secure treatment centre under the CFSA owes a duty 
    of care to the parents of a patient under its care raises a novel question 
    of law. This court has not considered this question. And, as far as I am aware, 
    apart from this case, neither has any trial court. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In Canada, for alleged duties falling outside recognized categories, 
    we determine whether a duty of care exists by applying the <i>Anns</i> test: 
    see <i>Anns v. Merton London Borough Council,</i> [1978] A.C. 728 (H.L.). 
    Although it has now been discarded in England and has been criticized by some 
    Canadian academics, the <i>Anns</i> test, as refined by the Supreme Court 
    of Canada, continues to structure the analysis of a duty of care in this country: 
    see <i>Cooper v. Hobart,</i> [2001] 3 S.C.R. 537, <i>Edwards v. Law Society 
    of</i> <i>Upper Canada</i>, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 562, and <i>Odhavji Estate v. 
    Woodhouse,</i> [2003] 3 S.C.R. 263; and see E.J. Weinrib, Does Tort Law Have 
    a Future? (2000) 34 Val. U. L. Rev. 561.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The refined <i>Anns</i> test has three elements. To establish that 
    Syl Apps and Baptiste owed the family of R.D. a duty of care, the plaintiffs 
    must show: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1. The harm the family complains of was a reasonably 
    foreseeable consequence of Syl Apps and Baptistes failure to take care;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   
    </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There 
    is sufficient proximity in the relationship between Syl Apps and the family, 
    and between Baptiste and the family, that it would be fair and just to impose 
    a duty of care on these defendants; and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>No residual 
    policy reasons exist to negate or limit this duty of care. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> At the pleading stage, consistent with the burden of proof on a r. 
    21.01(1)(b) motion, the family of R.D. is entitled to maintain its action 
    unless Syl Apps and Baptiste show that the plaintiffs are certain to fail 
    in establishing at least one of these three elements of the <i>Anns</i> test. 
    In my view, the defendants cannot meet this burden. </p>

    </span> The plaintiffs allege that Syl Apps and Baptiste took no steps to 
    question whether the alleged sexual abuse occurred, and took no steps to try 
    to reintegrate R.D. with her family. It is at least arguable that the harm 
    the plaintiffs complain of  the loss of any relationship with R.D.  would 
    be a reasonably foreseeable consequence if the defendants failed to take these

    relevant aspect of the CFSA is the statutes emphasis on judicial supervision

    s. 40 it must ask the court to make that determination. Indeed, but for exceptional 
    circumstances, a child protection worker may not take a child to a place of 
    safety without a warrant. Moreover, neither service providers nor employees 
    of a service provider can on their own determine that a child has been sexually 
    abused. Again, the court must make that determination. The statutes emphasis 
    on judicial supervision of the regulatory powers of service providers and 
    their employees suggests that the terms of the various court orders affecting 
    R.D. have relevance for assessing the criterion of proximity. </span></p>

style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In my view, the terms of the various wardship 
    orders buttress the plaintiffs argument on proximity. Section 37(2) of the 
    CFSA lists a number of grounds on which a court may determine that a child 
    is in need of protection. Two of these grounds  s. 37(2)(c) and (d)  relate 
    to sexual abuse. The court may find that a child is in need of protection 
    where the child has been sexually molested or exploited by her parents, or 
    where there is a substantial risk that the childs parents will sexually molest 
    or exploit her. Significantly, Judge Fuller did not make a finding that R.D. 
    was in need of protection on either of these grounds.</span></p>

    of the CFSA: she had suffered emotional harm or there was a substantial risk 
    she would suffer emotional harm, and her parents would not remedy the harm. 
    At bottom then, the plaintiffs say that they were at least entitled to expect 
    that R.D.s service provider and its employees would treat her in accordance 
    with the courts disposition, and not as if she had been sexually abused, 
    when the court made no such determination. </span></p>

    and 117. Therefore, I think that the terms of that order are also relevant 
    in considering whether Syl Apps and its employee owed the family of R.D. a 
    duty of care. According to that order, R.D. was placed at Syl Apps on terms 
    that included an obligation to support positive contact with her family, and

    a citizen to sue for damages, the legislation specifically creates that 
    legal duty. Second, they submit that s. 2(2) of the CFSA, which sets out the

    do the defendants not owe the plaintiffs a common law duty of care to adhere 
    to the provisions of the CFSA and the court orders made under it? At the very 
    least, it seems to me that what requirements s. 2(2) imposes on service providers 
    is the kind of issue best explored with an evidentiary record. </span></p>

    there is authority for the proposition that a doctors overriding duty is 
    to his or her patient, and that this duty excludes any other duty, even to 
    the parents of a young patient. Molloy J. made this point in a case relied 
    on by the motion judge, <i>P.S. v. Batth,</i> [1997] O.J. No. 4089 (Gen. Div.)(Q.L.)

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Dr. 
    Batth also argues that she did not owe any duty of care to the plaintiff. 
    I agree. Dr. Batths patient was J. and it is to that patient that she owed 
    a duty of care. Before there can be a cause of action for negligence, there 
    must be a relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant which creates 
    a duty of care on the part of the defendant as towards the plaintiff. In this 
    case there was no such duty of care. There is no positive obligation on a 
    doctor to conduct an independent investigation of allegations made by her 
    patient. The evidence shows that J. made a report of sexual abuse to her doctor 
    and that her doctor believed that she was acting in the best interest of the 
    child in reporting those allegations to the Childrens Aid Society. In these 
    circumstances there can be no duty of care owed to the plaintiff. Indeed, 
    it would be contrary to the spirit of the Act, as well as her professional 
    obligation to protect the best interest of the child. Accordingly, in my view, 
    a cause of action for negligence does not arise. </span></p>

    accepting the argument that Syl Apps and Baptiste can stand in no different 
    position from Dr. Meen, the motions judge has implicitly made two assumptions: 
    that Baptiste acted under Dr. Meens direction, and that any duty the defendants 
    owed to the family must be the same duty that they owed to R.D. Neither assumption 
    is necessarily true.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></span></p>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>In their pleading, 
    the plaintiffs make several allegations of negligence against Baptiste alone. 
    And the defendants do not plead that Baptiste acted solely under Dr. Meens 
    direction or solely in accordance with Dr. Meens instructions. If, for example, 
    Baptiste treated R.D. contrary to the courts disposition under s. 37(2) of 
    the statute and contrary to the doctors orders, and instead convinced R.D. 
    that she was a victim of her parents sexual abuse, it is arguable that the 
    defendants would be liable in tort. Counsel for the defendants unsupported 
    reference to predator and prey suggests that this example is a real possibility.

    and to her family - a result that on its face seems untenable. But another 
    possibility  at least arguable at the pleadings stage of this action  is 
    that Syl Apps may owe a duty to R.D.s family that differs from the duty owed 
    to R.D. and that these different duties would not necessarily conflict. For 
    example, although Syl Apps and Baptiste would always have a duty to act in 
    the best interests of a child under their care, this duty would not plainly 
    and obviously always conflict with a duty to investigate the validity of a 
    childs complaints, to treat the child consistently with the courts orders

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The second 
    policy consideration the defendants put forward is that the court should not 
    decide the question whether they owe a duty to the family on a case-by-case 
    basis, but should instead categorically refuse to recognize the existence 
    of such a duty. The defendants submit that imposing a duty on them to be mindful 
    of a familys interests as well as a childs interests would, in virtually 
    every case, unfairly hinder their primary obligation to treat the child under 
    their care.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Therefore, they contend

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Again this 
    contention may have merit. A categorical approach promotes the worthy value 
    of certainty. But the defendants contention remains one that in my view is 
    best considered on a proper evidentiary record. The scheme of the statute 
    does not contemplate a uniform approach to the treatment of children in need 
    of protection. Instead, the powers of service providers are circumscribed 
    by the terms of court orders regarding children in their care. The court orders 
    are individually tailored to the needs of the particular child. A categorical 
    approach to the question of duty seems inconsistent with this tailored, highly 
    individualized approach to child welfare under the CFSA. There may be many 
    cases, including the present one, where a service provider and its employees 
    can fulfill their duty to act in the best interests of the child and at the 
    same time can meet a court-imposed duty to the family of the child. </span></p>

    whether finding a duty of care owed to the family of a child as well as to 
    the child herself would create the havoc or operational conflicts that concern

    address an important English authority considered by the motion judge. In 
    dismissing the plaintiffs claim against Syl Apps and Baptiste, as well as

    of Appeal, Civil Division, <i>M.V.</i> <i>Newham L.B.C. London Borough Council; 
    P (minors) v. Bedforshire Borough Council</i>, [1994] 2 W.L.R. 554. In that 
    case, on similar facts, the court held that a childs mother could not maintain 
    a negligence action against either the childs treating psychiatrist or against 
    the local authority that had apprehended the child (at 574 per Sir Thomas 
    Bingham M.R.):</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The 
    psychiatrist would in my view have recognized the mother as someone foreseeably 
    likely to be injured if, as a result of her advice, the child were to be taken 
    away from the mother. But the mother was not in any meaningful sense the psychiatrists 
    patient. The psychiatrists duty was to act in the interests of the child, 
    and that might very well mean acting in a way that would be adverse to the 
    personal interests of the mother; she was concerned with those interests only 
    to the extent that they could have an impact on the interests of the child. 
    In this situation of potential conflict, I do not think the psychiatrist can 
    arguably be said to have owed a duty of care to the mother</span></p>

    U.K. statute contemplates a duty on the local authority to ascertain the

    an opportunity to be heard and represented. Moreover, the U.K. statute does 
    not seem to have an equivalent duty to that in s. 2(2)(b) that decisions 
    affecting the interests and rights of children and their parents are [to be] 
    made according to clear, consistent criteria and are subject to procedural

    (Sup.Ct. J.)), unquestionably in some cases courts have struck out these claims,

    owe private duties to individuals. Even at the pleadings stage, the Supreme 
    Court could say that a regulators overriding duty to the public was incompatible 
    with a private law duty of care. Logically, the two obviously could not co-exist.

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>At the first stage of the <i>Anns</i> test, the 
    question is whether the circumstances disclose reasonably foreseeable harm 
    and proximity sufficient to establish a <i>prima facie</i> duty of care. The 
    focus at this stage is on factors arising from the relationship between the 
    plaintiff and the defendant, <i>including broad considerations of policy</i>.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The starting point for this analysis is to 
    determine whether there are analogous categories of cases in which proximity 
    has previously been recognized.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If 
    no such cases exist, the question then becomes whether a new duty of care 
    should be recognized in the circumstances. <i>Mere foreseeability is not enough 
    to establish a </i>prima facie<i> duty of care.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>The plaintiff must also show proximity -- that the defendant was in 
    a close and direct relationship to him or her such that it is just to impose 
    a duty of care in the circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Factors 
    giving rise to proximity must be grounded in the governing statute when there 
    is one, as in the present case.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If the plaintiff is successful at the first stage 
    of <i>Anns</i> such that a <i>prima facie</i> duty of care has been established 
    (despite the fact that the proposed duty does not fall within an already recognized 
    category of recovery), the second stage of the <i>Anns</i> test must be addressed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>That question is whether there exist residual policy considerations 
    which justify denying liability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><i>Residual 
    policy considerations include, among other things, the effect of recognizing 
    that duty of care on other legal obligations, its impact on the legal system 
    and, in a less precise but important consideration, the effect of imposing

    not necessarily conflict and therefore they should be allowed to co-exist. 
    Precisely the same thing could be said of the doctor-patient relationship 
     there are undoubtedly many situations where the doctor could fulfill his 
    or her duty to the patient and, at the same time, satisfy a different duty 
    to the parents of the patient.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The difficulty with this argument is that</span><span

    para. 44, if the duty claimed would <i>potentially</i> conflict with the 
    [defendants] overarching duty [emphasis added], proximity is not made out. 
    In my view, the duty of care pertaining to the relationship between children 
    in need of protection and those who are charged with their care should be 
    clearly defined on a categorical basis, rather than being left in a fluid 
    state to be resolved on a case-by-case basis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Doctors, social workers and operators of secure treatment facilities 
    have a difficult task to perform and they need to know where they stand.<span

    conflict and consequent harm to the primary and paramount duty owed to the 
    child and determine whether that potential harm is sufficient to negate proximity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>As I see it, the imposition of an overlapping duty to the childs parents
