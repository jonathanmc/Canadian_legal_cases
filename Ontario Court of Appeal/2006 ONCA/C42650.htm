      appellant was charged with first degree murder.  The Crown alleged that
      he murdered the victim after he sexually assaulted her or attempted to
      sexually assault her, thereby committing first degree murder as defined
      by s. 231(5) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The appellant conceded that
      he killed the victim.  He argued, however, that the Crown had not proved
      beyond a reasonable doubt that he had the requisite intent for murder,
      and that the Crown had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he had
      sexually assaulted or attempted to sexually assault the victim immediately
      before killing her.  The appellant argued that he should be convicted of
      manslaughter.  The jury convicted the appellant of first degree murder.  </span></p>

      appellant raises two issues on his appeal from that conviction.  He alleges
      misdirection on the issue of intoxication.  He also argues that the trial
      judge erred in admitting evidence of a sexual assault committed by the
      appellant several years before this homicide.  </span></p>

      would dismiss the appeal.  I doubt that the trial judge erred in her intoxication
      instruction, however, if there was an error, it did not prejudice the appellant.  The
      trial judge properly considered the admissibility of the similar fact evidence.  It
      was open to the trial judge to conclude that the probative value of that
      evidence warranted its admission despite its significant prejudicial potential.  </span></p>

      appellant and a friend met the victim and a friend by chance around 2:30
      a.m. on an Ottawa street on June 1, 2002.  The four young people talked
      and walked to a somewhat secluded area.  Eventually, the appellant’s friend
      and the victim’s friend left together, leaving the appellant and the victim
      alone.  The two walked toward a more secluded area along the river.  </span></p>

      appellant and the victim ended up beside the river on a concrete slab that
      was used as a dock by kayakers.  Physical evidence subsequently gathered
      on the concrete slab demonstrated that the appellant severely beat the
      victim.  He hit her at least nine times on the head with a rock and rendered
      her unconscious.  At least one of those blows was struck while the victim
      was laying on the concrete slab.  The appellant dragged the victim’s body
      across the slab and dumped her into the river.  She was still alive when
      she was pushed into the river but eventually drowned.  Her head injuries
      were sufficiently severe that they would have caused her death if she had
      not drowned.  Her body was found in the river about fifteen hours later.  </span></p>

      valiant fight for her life.</span></p>

      is often the case where the victim is killed, the Crown did not have direct
      evidence that the appellant sexually assaulted or attempted to sexually
      assault the victim immediately before he killed her.  There was, however,
      circumstantial evidence supporting the Crown’s position.  When the victim’s
      body was pulled from the water, she was naked from the waist down with
      the exception of a sock on one foot.  Her underwear was found under a bench
      on the concrete slab where the appellant had beat the victim.  Her pants
      were never found.      </span></p>

      Crown also led the evidence of a witness who was camping near the area
      where the appellant killed the victim.  This witness testified that at
      about 2:30 a.m. he heard a man and woman walking towards him chatting in
      a friendly manner.  The two individuals walked past him and headed down
      a path that led to the concrete slab where the victim was beaten.  Soon
      after the man and woman had passed him, at about 3:00 a.m., the witness
      heard a woman scream.  He heard her say something like, “Get off me” or “Get
      away from me”.  About one minute later, the witness heard a second scream
      and then heard the sound of a tree branch breaking.  He heard nothing after
      this.    </span></p>

      witness who saw the two individuals and heard the woman scream, could not
      identify the appellant.  The evidence strongly supported the inference
      that the appellant and the victim were the two individuals that the witness
      saw headed down the path towards the concrete slab and that the screams
      he heard came from the victim.  </span></p>

      was not physically attracted to the appellant and had told her friend that
      the appellant was “ugly”.  The victim had been drinking on the evening
      she was killed.  Her post-mortem blood alcohol level was between .104 and
      .124.</span></p>

      was no clear evidence as to how much the appellant drank or how much marijuana
      he consumed.  The timing of the consumption of the alcohol and marijuana
      during the afternoon and evening before the homicide was also unclear.  The
      trial judge determined that the evidence relating to drinking and the use
      of marijuana was sufficient to require an instruction as to the relevance
      of those factors in assessing the appellant’s state of mind when he killed
      the victim.  </span></p>

      her.  The trial judge admitted this evidence for that purpose.  As the
      appellant challenges that ruling, I will deal with the substance of this

      proof.  He submits that the Crown carries the burden on the question of

      this burden of proof requires the Crown to prove that the appellant had

      above-quoted passage from the trial judge’s instruction sounds alarm bells
      for those schooled in a long line of jurisprudence dealing with the relationship

      appreciate how the jury –
    not a group of criminal lawyers, but a collection of reasonable laypersons
    –   would understand these instructions, one must put them in the context
    of the conduct of the trial.  </span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>Her Honour will explain the defence of intoxication to you.  The burden
      of proof is on the Crown to prove that the defence of intoxication does

      it was not required to prove that the appellant was not intoxicated.  The
      trial judge indicated that she would take care of the Crown’s concerns
      in her instructions to the jury.  Defence counsel made no comment and raised
      no objection after the trial judge had given the instruction that is now

      her instructions, the trial judge told the jury that the Crown had to prove
      either of the mental states required for murder under s. 229(a) of the <i>Criminal
      Code</i> beyond a reasonable doubt.  She also told the jury that the evidence
      of the appellant’s consumption of alcohol and marijuana was relevant to
      his state of mind and had to be considered along with the rest of the evidence
      that could assist in determining his state of mind.  She specifically tied
      the evidence of alcohol and marijuana consumption to the jury’s consideration
      of whether it should infer that the appellant intended the natural consequences
      of his actions.  </span></p>

      challenged passage from the instruction appears immediately following the
      trial judge’s summary of the position of the Crown and defence on the question
      of intention.  The trial judge drew a distinction between intoxication
      and the appellant’s state of mind.  She told the jury that intoxication
      was not a stand-alone defence and that a person who had the state of mind
      required for murder was guilty of murder even if that person was intoxicated.  She
      said:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>Intoxication that causes a person to cast off restraint and to act
      in a manner in which he would not act if sober is no excuse for committing

      intoxicated state of mind is, nonetheless, a state of mind.  </span></p>

      this instruction, the trial judge noted that there was no such thing as
      the defence of intoxication and that the issue was the appellant’s state
      of mind, not his sobriety.  This instruction was both correct and necessary
      in light of defence counsel’s closing argument.  </span></p>

      trial judge’s instruction that the Crown was not obliged to disprove intoxication
      was unnecessary in that she had already told the jury that intoxication
      was not a freestanding defence.  In a perfect world, the trial judge would
      have avoided using language that had any possibility of suggesting to the
      jury that the Crown did not carry the onus on the issue of intent.  However,
      perfection is not the standard against which jury instructions are measured.  </span></p>

      have no doubt that a jury, listening to this instruction as a whole, would
      clearly understand three things:  first, that the Crown had to prove the
      requisite intent for murder; second, that the evidence of the appellant’s
      consumption of alcohol and marijuana was relevant to whether the Crown
      had proved the requisite intent; and third, that even if the appellant
      was under the influence of alcohol and marijuana, he was guilty of murder
      if he had the requisite intent.  The instructions armed the jury with the
      information needed to understand the relationship between the evidence
      of intoxication and the question of whether the Crown had proved beyond
      a reasonable doubt that the appellant had the requisite intent for murder.  </span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The probative
    value of the similar fact evidence is also very high when considered in the

      the night Ms. A. died, I would have more difficulty concluding, in the

      he was rebuffed by the victim in 1995, viciously attacked her, and sexually
      assaulted her.  It is equally important to bear in mind that at this trial,

      two alleged factual errors arise out of the trial judge’s description of

      trial judge said:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>He [the appellant] sought out a young woman at a social occasion,
      whom he had never met before, lured her to a secluded area where he could

      contends that there is no evidence that the appellant sought out this victim
      or that he lured her to a secluded area.  Counsel submits that the evidence
      demonstrates that they met by chance in a secluded area.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      disagree with the appellant’s contention that there was no evidence that
      the appellant lured the victim to a secluded area.  They did meet in a
      somewhat secluded area; however, before attacking her, he took her to a
      more secluded area.  On this evidence, it was open to the trial judge to
      find that both this event and the 1995 event involved a luring of the victims
      to secluded areas.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      think counsel is correct when he asserts that the evidence does not support
      the conclusion that the appellant “sought out” this victim.  They did meet
      by chance; however, once they met, the appellant certainly focused his
      attention on this victim.  I do not think that the trial judge’s misdescription
      of how the appellant and the victim initially met was of any significance
      to her ruling that the evidence should be received.  Certainly, this minor
      error falls far below the kind of material misapprehension of relevant
      evidence needed to justify a reversal of that ruling.  </span></p>

      come now to the final argument made by counsel for the appellant.  He submits
      that the existence of a body of circumstantial evidence independent of
      the similar fact evidence which supports the inference that the appellant
      sexually assaulted the victim cannot enhance the probative value of the
      similar fact evidence and should not have been used for that purpose by
      the trial judge.  Counsel draws a distinction between using other evidence
      that the appellant sexually assaulted the victim to enhance the probative
      value of the similar fact evidence and using that evidence to require a
      lower level of probative value to admit the evidence of the 1995 attack.  Counsel
      argues that the former constitutes an error in law while the latter is
      an appropriate approach to the admissibility of similar fact evidence.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      counsel’s submission has some initial logical attraction, the distinction
      drawn by him is ultimately not tenable.  There is no functional difference
      insofar as the admissibility of the similar fact evidence is concerned
      between using the other evidence to increase the probative value of the
      similar fact evidence and using the other evidence to lower the level of
      probative value needed to sustain admissibility.  Both exercises tip the
      evidentiary scales in favour of admitting the similar fact evidence.</span></p>

      read the passages from the trial judge’s reasons set out above, in para.
      31, as holding that the other reliable evidence that the victim was sexually
      assaulted rendered the drawing of the inference of sexual assault from
      the evidence of the 1995 incident easier, or safer, than it would have
      been had the evidence of the 1995 incident stood alone.  This analysis
      is consistent with the proper approach to circumstantial evidence that
      requires that its cogency be assessed in the context of all of the evidence
      relevant to the particular inference.  The trial judge’s analysis also
      finds support in caselaw from this court.  In <i>R. v. Carpenter (No. 2)</i> (1982),
      1 C.C.C. (3d) 149 (Ont. C.A.), the court considered whether on an arson
      charge the trial judge had properly admitted evidence of fires at two other
      properties owned by the appellant.  The evidence was offered to support
      the Crown’s position that the fires were not accidental.  Grange J.A.,
      for the court, said at p. 156:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span

      think these authorities establish that depending on the issue to which
      the similar fact evidence is directed, and the inference drawing process

      an accused to a crime may not augment the probative value of similar fact
      evidence offered to prove identity, because the probative value of similar
      fact evidence offered to prove identity depends first and foremost on the
      inference that the acts in question were committed by the same person.  Circumstantial
      evidence, no matter how cogent, that an accused committed one of the acts
      adds no force to the inference that the same person committed both of the
      acts: see David M. Paciocco &amp; Lee Stuesser, <i>The Law of Evidence</i>,

      agree with the commentators that other circumstantial evidence will not
      necessarily increase the probative value of similar fact evidence.  The
      effect of the other evidence will depend on the issue to which the similar
      fact evidence is directed and the nature of the inference that the Crown
      seeks to draw from the similar fact evidence.  In this case, the similar
      fact evidence was offered to support the inference that the appellant sexually
      assaulted or attempted to sexually assault the victim before he killed
      her.  Other evidence, apart from the similar fact evidence supporting the
      inference that he sexually assaulted the victim, could facilitate drawing
      the inference of a sexual assault from the similar fact evidence.  Viewed
      this way, the other circumstantial evidence enhanced the probative value
      of the similar fact evidence and was properly taken into account by the
      trial judge in deciding whether the similar fact evidence should be received.  </span></p>
