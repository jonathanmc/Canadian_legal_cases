style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was convicted of assault with a weapon; breach of a recognizance
    for failing to keep the peace and be of good behaviour; and breach of a condition
    in his recognizance that required him to be at his place of residence between
    10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals only his conviction for the failure to be at his place
    of residence between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the appellant was engaged in the assault at 7:30 or
    8:00 p.m. on the evening of June 18, 2002 in the City of Ottawa.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    were four other persons involved in the assault.  One of the bystander witnesses
    said that the appellant was wearing a white baseball cap, a red short-sleeved
    shirt and blue pants.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later
    that evening at about 11:30 p.m., Constable McCabe of the Ottawa police force
    attended at the appellant’s residence.  The appellant was at home.  The police
    officer arrested the appellant and at that time seized from his bedroom a
    white baseball cap and a red jacket.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Constable
    McCabe testified as follows in respect of the red jacket:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I do have written down in my notes that the – the
    red jacket was…The – the word I used was sweaty inside, moist.  It must’ve
    been wet and warm as though somebody had just worn it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge gave very brief reasons for judgment which focused on the assault
    charge.  After dealing with the assault charge, the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Likewise, I accept the evidence of the two police
    officers who testified, Sean Kay and Also Quinn McCabe.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It was Officer McCabe who found the white baseball
    cap and the red jacket at the defendant’s home at the time of his arrest.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Having considered all of the evidence and for these
    brief reasons and accepting, as I do, Katrina Wallin’s evidence that the
    time of this offence was around 7:30 or 8:00 p.m., I am accordingly satisfied
    beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant before the Court was one of
    those who attacked the victim with a bike lock and I am satisfied beyond
    a reasonable doubt accordingly that all three charges have been proven.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is apparent that the trial judge must have convicted the appellant for the
    breach of curfew based on the evidence of Constable McCabe in relation to
    his seizure of the jacket.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that there was no clear evidence that the appellant was
    out of his residence past 10:00 p.m.  He further submits that given the trial
    judge’s finding of fact that the assault occurred at 7:30 or 8:00 p.m., his
    conclusion in regard to the breach of curfew was unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the evidence that the red jacket was moist and warm at 11:30 p.m.
    and may have just been worn is not evidence which is capable of establishing
    beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was not in his place of residence
    past 10:00 p.m.  We therefore conclude that the decision reached by the trial
    judge is not one that a properly instructed jury acting judicially could
    reasonably have rendered.  See <i>R. v. Yebes</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, the appeal is allowed, the conviction is quashed and an acquittal
    is entered.</p>
