      of Justice David L. McWilliam of the Superior Court of Justice dated November
      12, 2004</span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>.</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the trial judge could have given more detailed reasons, on the succinct reasons
    he did provide, it is apparent to us that he was satisfied that OIC merged
    with the appellant CORC, that upon that merger, CORC continued the respondent’s
    employment in accordance with the terms of a working agreement he had entered
    into with OIC and that the working agreement was not a sham (as the appellant
    argued) but a valid and binding agreement (as the respondent argued).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, it was open to the trial judge to make those findings and we see
    no basis for interfering with them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    light of those findings, the trial judge recognized, correctly in our view,
    that in its essence, this case boiled down to a question of reasonable notice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    that issue, the trial judge awarded the equivalent of fourteen months pay
    in lieu of notice. On the face of it, that award would appear to be excessive
    given that this was a younger employee who had been employed, at the equivalent
    of a middle level management position, for only about two and a half years.
    The only justification offered by the trial judge for this large award was
    the employer’s failure, in the circumstances, to provide a promised reference
    letter, which the trial judge felt warranted additional notice pursuant to
    the principles in <i>Wallace v. United Grain Growers Ltd.</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R.
    701.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, while the failure to provide a reference letter warranted some
    increase in the length of notice to which the respondent was entitled, in
    these circumstances, it did not justify the significant extension contended
    for by the respondent of fourteen months. We consider that award to be manifestly
    excessive. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are also of the view that the employment security provision in the respondent’s
    contract provides little basis for an enhanced notice period in light of
    the circumstances in which the respondent worked. Indeed, on these facts,
    the provision gave the respondent no additional rights.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the circumstances, including the nature and length of the respondent’s employment,
    the terms of his working agreement and a modest enhancement in accordance
    with <i>Wallace</i> principles, we think that a notice of seven months, while
    generous, would have been reasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also raised a bias argument. The record, in our view, does not
    substantiate the appellant’s concern. Nor, in our view, is there any basis
    for interfering with the trial judge’s disposition of the third party claim
    or with the costs awarded at trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is allowed in part and the order of the trial judge is varied
    accordingly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties achieved mixed success.  In our view, they should bear their own
    costs of the appeal.</p>
