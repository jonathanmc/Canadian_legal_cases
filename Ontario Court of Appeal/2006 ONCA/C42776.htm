    acceptable delay standard with his own 24-month standard.  He simply observed that this kind of case
    would normally and reasonably take about 24 months to proceed from charge
    through preliminary inquiry through to trial before a judge and jury.</p>

line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the trial judge that in the unusual
    circumstances of this case the time between the swearing of the information and
    arrest should not have formed part of any reasonable delay.  Process could not be executed through reasons
    beyond the control of the state because of the appellant’s voluntary absence

    considerable portion of the delay and the appellant demonstrated little concern
    about the slow pace of the litigation.  Delay was responsible for only modest prejudice.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not agree with the submission that the trial
    judge erred by admitting the similar fact evidence or that he admitted it with
    respect to identity.  Numerous excerpts
    in the reasons of the trial judge demonstrate that he admitted the similar fact
    evidence as probative of the truthfulness of the accounts of the complainants
    in relation to whether the offences occurred and to rebut the defence of
    innocent association.  He considered that
    the complainants made similar reports and that it was unlikely that the
    similarity was coincidental.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Collusion was not made an issue by the defence.  There was no evidence that any of the
    complainants gave or received details of the incidents that were included in
    the accounts.  The evidence pointed to
    nothing more than contact and general discussions and it was limited to only a
    few of the eight complainants prior to the time the complaints were made to the
    police.  As Binnie J. observed, “the
    issue is concoction or collaboration not contact.  If the evidence amounts to no more than
    opportunity, it will usually best be left to the jury”: <i>R. v. Handy</i> (2002), 164 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at para. 111 (S.C.C.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It must be remembered that on the issue of similar fact
    evidence, appellate courts take a “strongly deferential approach to trial
    judges’ decisions” in relation to relevance of probative value and prejudicial
    effect: <i>R. v. Harvey</i> (2001), 160 C.C.C. (3d) 52 at para. 44 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">

line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge did not err on this issue.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='

lang=EN-US>c) &amp; d)           The trial

line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We note that this case turned on the credibility of the
    witnesses.  With respect to issues c) and
    d), the trial judge generally accepted the evidence of the complainants, with
    some exceptions, and he rejected the evidence of the appellant.  His reasons for accepting and rejecting the
    evidence of the witnesses are well founded and deference must be given to his
    assessment.</p>

line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no merit in these issues.</p>

    impose a conditional sentence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given the number of victims and the nature of the
    offences, the three-year global sentence imposed by the trial judge is not
    unfit for these offences and this offender.  We would not interfere, noting that in the absence of a demonstration of
    remorse and acceptance of responsibility, the passage of time cannot mitigate in
    cases of historical sexual abuse: <i>R. v. (M.)W.W.</i> (2006), 205 C.C.C. (3d)
    410 at paras. 14-27 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  As we would not interfere with the three-year
    sentence, there is no basis for a conditional sentence.</p>
