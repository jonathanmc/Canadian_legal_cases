style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue in this appeal concerns the dissolution of a constructive trust imposed
    by the court on the shares of Ron Engineering and Construction (International)
    Ltd. (“Ron International”).  The constructive trust was imposed for the benefit
    of the partners in a joint venture established for the financing and development
    of the City Hall of Jerusalem.  The appellant appeals the order that granted
    the dissolution of the constructive trust.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Albert
    Reichmann and Zeev Vered were long time friends who, from time to time, engaged
    in business ventures together.  Mr. Reichmann was the chairman, chief administrative
    officer and a principal shareholder of Olympia &amp; York Developments Limited
    (“O &amp; Y”).  Mr. Vered was the head of a construction and consulting engineering
    business in Ottawa that was carried on by Ron Engineering and Construction
    Ltd. (“Ron Canada”). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>O &amp; Y
    and Mr. Vered, through Ron Canada, had participated in at least five joint
    ventures in the United States and three others in the Ottawa area.  These
    joint ventures involved the construction and ownership of medium to large
    scale commercial projects.  Typically, O &amp; Y provided the financing and
    Ron Canada, or one of its affiliates, developed the projects.  The agreements
    for all the joint ventures were oral agreements.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1988, Mr. Reichmann entered into an oral agreement with Ron Canada through
    Mr. Vered, for the financing and construction of a new city hall for Jerusalem.  Mr.
    Reichmann was to arrange for up to thirty million dollars U.S. to be loaned
    by the joint venture to the city for the project.  Ron Canada was to provide
    the personnel and facilities for the project management.  Ron International
    was the vehicle through which the joint venture was to operate.  Ron International
    was a company with no assets.  Mr. Vered owned 98% of the shares of Ron International.  The
    remaining 2% of the shares were owned by Mr. Vered’s son, Gilat.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    profits of the joint venture were initially to be shared on the basis of
    60% to Mr. Reichmann or O &amp; Y and 40% to Ron Canada or Mr. Vered.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    design of the project commenced in June 1988.  A building permit was issued
    in the spring of 1990 and the excavation and foundation work were commenced.  O &amp; Y
    provided some monies by way of loan to Ron International for further loan
    to the City of Jerusalem in accordance with Mr. Reichmann’s obligation to
    provide financing for the joint venture.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    1991, the scope of the project was expanded by Jerusalem and the city needed
    an additional thirty million dollars U.S. in financing which it sought from
    Mr. Reichmann.  Mr. Reichmann turned down the request but agreed to assist
    in finding other sources of funds.  Much of what followed is not relevant
    to the present issue before the court.  It is sufficient to note that O &amp; Y,
    due to its own financial difficulties, was unable to provide up to thirty
    million dollars U.S. to satisfy Mr. Reichmann’s obligation under the joint
    venture agreement.  This resulted in discussions and negotiations among a
    number of representatives of all of the interested parties including Mr.
    Reichmann, O &amp; Y, Mr. Vered and the City of Jerusalem.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the end of the day, Mr. Vered took the position that Mr. Reichmann was not
    entitled to any share in the joint venture.  Mr. Vered adopted the stance
    that O &amp;
    Y’s withdrawal of its financing for the City of Jerusalem constituted a fundamental
    breach which entitled Mr. Vered to treat it as a repudiation of the joint
    venture agreement by Mr. Reichmann.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    June 1994, Mr. Reichmann commenced an action against Mr. Vered and Ron International
    for the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) repayment of $1,869,578 advanced by O
    &amp; Y for over-head or administrative costs of the project;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) an accounting of all sums paid to the defendants

    May 30, 1995, Chilcott J. of the Superior Court of Justice ordered that the
    trial should proceed on a bifurcated basis with the court to decide in the
    first phase the threshold issue of Mr. Reichmann’s entitlement, if any, to
    be paid any monies or to be provided with an accounting.  The second phase
    was to deal with the accounting, if so ordered, and related issues as well
    as counterclaims of Mr. Vered and Ron International.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first phase of the trial proceeded before Cameron J. in the spring of 2000.  The
    trial dealt solely with the following issues:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is

    December 1, 1991, Mr. Reichmann and Mr. Vered agreed that Mr. Vered’s share

    paragraph 296 of the reasons for judgment, the trial judge said: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mr. Vered owned 98% of the shares of Ron Inter-national;
    his son owned the remainder.  In view of the Joint Venture Agreement, Mr.
    Vered and his son held those shares in trust for the benefit of the joint
    venturers in proportion to their respective interests.  There is no suggestion
    that Mr. Vered did not control the election of the board.  Mr. Reichmann
    was the beneficial owner, or the assignee of the beneficial owner, of one
    of those Joint Venture interests; Mr. Vered, or Ron Canada as his assignee,
    was the beneficial owner of the other.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    formal judgment makes no reference to Mr. Vered’s holding shares of Ron International
    in trust for the benefit of the joint venture partners.  However, neither
    the appellant nor the respondents have raised this as an issue.  All appear
    to accept that a constructive trust was imposed on the shares of Ron International
    by the reasons for judgment of October 27, 2000 and confirmed by the reasons
    for judgment of March 21, 2003.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second phase of the bifurcated trial proceeded before Cameron J. in May,
    June, August and September 2002.  Judgment was granted on March 21, 2003.  In
    the result, the trial judge ordered the defendants to pay O
    &amp; Y $1,528,539 and to deliver to Mr. Reichmann a revised accounting of
    the profits of the joint venture with Mr. Reichmann to be paid his share
    of the profits.  The trial judge also declared that the joint venture interests
    shall be revised to 65% for Ron Canada and 35% for Mr. Reichmann as a result
    of the reduced participation by Mr. Reichmann in the joint venture.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The motion to discharge the
      constructive trust</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In
    September 2004, Mr. Vered and Ron International moved to discharge the constructive
    trust imposed by the court upon Mr. Vered in respect of the shares of Ron
    International.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior
    to bringing the motion to discharge the constructive trust, the respondents
    paid the amount owing on the O &amp; Y loan in accordance with the reasons
    for judgment of March 21, 2003.  Also, Mr. Reichmann was paid his share of
    the joint venture net profits in accordance with the aforesaid judgment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion was brought before the trial judge.  The trial judge summarized the
    purpose of the motion at paragraph 5 of his reasons for judgment as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The reason for this motion is to enable Mr. Vered
    and Ron Canada to take advantage of losses accumulated in Ron International
    since the 1993 reorganization in activities which are said do not relate
    to the Joint Venture.  The losses were created by the legal fees of Mr. Vered
    and Ron International in this action and interest on the O &amp; Y loan.  The
    losses were funded by loans from Mr. Vered and other Ron Canada companies
    which total about $5 million.  The losses could be used to reduce the tax
    liability of other Ron Canada companies by as much as $1.5 million if they
    are accepted by Canada Revenue Agency.  The use of the losses would be effected
    by an amalgamation of Ron International with a company or companies with
    profits and then setting off the losses against the profits in the amalgamated
    company for the purpose of determining its taxable income.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for Mr. Vered and Ron International submitted to the trial judge that the
    constructive trust had been imposed to secure the repayment of the O &amp; Y
    loan and the payment to Mr. Reichmann of his share of the joint venture net
    profits.  Since all payments had been made, the constructive trust had served
    its purpose and was no longer required.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for Mr. Reichmann submitted to the trial judge that the discharge of the
    constructive trust would be tantamount to the expropriation of his legitimate
    interest in the shares of Ron International.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge ordered the dissolution of the constructive trust.  He observed
    that Mr. Reichmann,
    “never asserted a property interest in the shares and never claimed they
    had a value beyond his share of profits”.  The trial judge further commented
    that Mr. Reichmann provided no evidence that the discharge of the constructive
    trust would deprive him of a benefit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also observed at paragraph 13 of his reasons for judgment:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Ron International was contributed by Ron Canada
    and Mr. Vered to the Joint Venture as the vehicle through which the Joint
    Venture would operate.  The Joint Venture Agreement was totally silent on
    the issue of ownership of the shares of the Joint Venture vehicle, Ron International,
    once all loans had been repaid, expenses paid and profits distributed.  There
    was no perceived residual economic value to the shares.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the trial judge also made the following statement in paragraph two of his
    reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In 1988, Mr. Reichmann or O &amp; Y was to be a
    shareholder of the joint venture vehicle Ron International.  No shares were
    ever registered in his or its name.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>There was no further elaboration
    of this point.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The appellant’s position on
      this appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant made the following submissions:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge erred in dissolving the constructive trust.  Mr. Reichmann’s
    share ownership was not created by the declaration or imposition of the con-structive
    trust.  Mr. Reichmann owned the shares in Ron International from the outset
    as a result of the formation of the joint venture.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    constructive trust was imposed simply because Mr. Vered failed to change
    the share register of Ron International to reflect Mr. Reichmann’s interest
    and for no other reason.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fact that the trial judge found that after the pay out to Mr. Reichmann,
    the shares of Ron International had no value to him is irrelevant.  Valuable
    or worthless, the shares were the property of Mr. Reichmann.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Vered’s desire to dissolve the constructive trust for the purpose of amalgamating
    Ron International with another corporation or corporations to gain a signif-icant
    tax advantage was not a proper basis for the court to exercise its discretion.  The
    manner in which Mr. Vered chooses to organize his financial affairs to take
    advantage of possible tax losses and Ron International is not an appropriate
    consideration for the court in the litigation between Mr. Vered and Mr. Reichmann.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(v)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    effect of the dissolution order is to grant a benefit to Mr. Vered at Mr.
    Reichmann’s expense, i.e. to render Mr. Vered’s expenses of defending the

    exercise its discretion to dissolve the constructive trust.  </p>

    Vered was in breach of his obligations to Mr. Reichmann to make full disclosure

    for the respondents make two general submissions.  First, the respondents
    submit that the court has a “wide scope” within which to exercise its equitable
    jurisdiction.  Equitable remedies are flexible and seek what is just in all
    the circumstances of the case.  See <i>Soulos v. Korkontzilas</i>, [1997]
    2 S.C.R. 217 at para. 34; and <i>Pettkus v. Becker</i>, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 834
    at 847-848.  In the circumstances of this case, the trial judge has obtained
    a just result and this court ought not to interfere.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the respondents submit that the beneficiary of a constructive trust is required
    to choose between the remedies he or she seeks –
    either to exercise his or her proprietary rights in the subject matter of
    the trust or to rely on the personal liability of the trustee to account
    as the appellant did in the case at bar.  Once the accounts have been taken
    and the amounts found owing paid, the constructive trust will be discharged.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the respondents was not able to cite any judicial authority for the above
    proposition.  However, he referred us to the following passage from A. J.
    Oakley, <i>Constructive Trusts</i>, 3d ed. (London: Sweet and Maxwell, 1997)
    at 8:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If the beneficiary instead chooses to rely on the
    personal liability of the constructive trustee to account, he will in effect
    be claiming equitable compensation for breach of trust from the constructive
    trustee.  In the event that the beneficiary had chosen to employ this remedy
    in any of the situations which have just been used as illustrations, he would
    in each case have recovered the value of whatever interest he had been held
    to have in the subject-matter of the constructive trust, valued as at the
    moment at which the constructive trust took effect, together with interest
    thereon.  (This is also the measure of recovery in the alleged second type
    of constructive trust, better regarded as an example of equity imposing a
    personal liability to account in the same manner as a trustee.)  Since such
    reliance on the personal liability of the constructive trustee to account
    is normally alternative to reliance on the proprietary rights held by the
    beneficiary in the subject-matter of the constructive trust, payment by the
    constructive trustee of the appropriate sum will have the effect of discharging
    these proprietary rights; consequently, the constructive trustee will thereafter
    be absolutely beneficially entitled to the property upon which the constructive
    trust was imposed. (footnotes omitted)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on the above analysis, counsel for the respondents argues that the appellant
    did not choose to pursue any proprietary interest in the shares of Ron International
    but chose to seek an accounting.  The appellant, having obtained an accounting
    and payment of the amount found due to him, was estopped from pursuing his
    claim to ownership of the shares.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect of the appellant’s principal argument that his claim to ownership
    of the shares in Ron International can be traced directly to the formation
    of the joint venture, I am unable to agree.  The record of the various proceedings
    suggests otherwise.  This is amply demonstrated by the statement of claim
    issued by the appellant.  In the prayer for relief, Mr. Reichmann sought
    the repayment of a loan to O &amp; Y, an accounting in respect of the joint
    venture and payment of his share of the profits of the joint venture.  No
    claim is advanced in respect of the ownership of shares in Ron International.  Perhaps
    of more importance, the appellant does not plead that he was a shareholder
    of Ron International.  The appellant simply described Ron International in
    his statement of claim as, “a closely held Ontario business corporation” with
    its head office in the City of Ottawa.  It would seem logical that if the
    appellant considered himself to be a shareholder in Ron International he
    would have so pleaded.    A reference to a closely held Ontario business
    corporation is consistent with a recognition that the shares of the corporation
    were owned by Mr. Vered and his son.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    October 27, 2000 judgment of the court simply states that the appellant continued
    throughout to own an interest in the joint venture.  The joint venture was
    not Ron International.  The joint venture was a partnership between Mr. Reichmann
    and Ron Canada.  Ron International was simply the vehicle through which the
    joint venture operated, as found by the trial judge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    acknowledge that the trial judge said, at the outset of his brief reasons
    on the motion to discharge the constructive trust, that in 1988 either Mr.
    Reichmann or O &amp; Y was to be a shareholder of the joint venture.  There
    is passing reference in the trial judge’s reasons for judgment of October
    27, 2000 to the possibility of O &amp; Y becoming a principal shareholder
    of Ron International (see para. 25 of the reasons).  There is also reference
    to an unsigned memo of November 23, 1988 from O &amp; Y’s files that stated: “we
    will have to sort out as to who owns Ron International” and “Ron International
    may be owned 100% by AR” (see para. 127 of the reasons).  There is another
    reference to Albert Reichmann as a potential shareholder of Ron International
    contained in a draft letter of advice to Mr. Vered in October 1990 (see para.
    133 of the reasons).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the end of the day, the trial judge did not make any finding that the appellant
    was the owner of shares in Ron International.  His imposition of the constructive
    trust was consistent with an intention to insure that there was some security
    for the payment of what may ultimately found to be owing by Mr. Vered and/or
    Ron Canada from the joint venture.  Counsel for the appellant argues that
    the notion of security for payment to Mr. Reichmann was pointless because
    Mr. Vered had transferred all the joint venture funds out of Ron International.  Whether
    or not the imposition of a constructive trust was no more than an academic
    gesture does not, in my view, alter what the trial judge was attempting to
    do in the circumstances.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree that it may have been more helpful for the trial judge to have expressly
    said that he had imposed the constructive trust as a remedial measure to
    provide security for the payment of amounts found owing to Mr. Reichmann
    and O &amp; Y after the accounting.  However, the fact that he dissolved
    the constructive trust after the payments were made to O &amp; Y and Mr.
    Reichmann can lead to no other conclusion.  Support for this conclusion can
    be found in the statement of the trial judge at para. 3 of his reasons on
    the motion:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I stated at paragraph 295 of my March 2003 reasons
    that if the net amount was paid promptly, “in my opinion Mr. Reichmann will
    have been fairly compensated under this judgment for the failure to account”.  I
    had no thought that Mr. Reichmann’s shares might have some value.  He never
    asserted a property interest in the shares and never claimed they had a value
    beyond his share of profits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    determined that Mr. Reichmann’s claim to the ownership of the shares does
    not arise from the formation of the joint venture, I turn to the other issues
    raised by his counsel.  Since there is considerable overlap in each of the
    remaining grounds of appeal, I propose to deal with them on a somewhat global
    basis.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    recorded above, counsel for the appellant argued that the finding of the
    trial judge that the shares of Ron International had no value to Mr. Reichmann
    was irrelevant.  Valuable or worthless, the shares were the property of Mr.
    Reichmann.  In one sense, I agree with counsel.  However, in my view, the
    trial judge was merely considering all of the circumstances in arriving at
    the conclusion to dissolve the constructive trust.  That the shares had no
    particular value to Mr. Reichmann was simply a factor in his deciding to
    exercise his discretion in favour of Mr. Vered. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s argument, that it was inappropriate to dissolve the constructive
    trust in order to provide a significant financial or tax advantage to Mr.
    Vered fails to take into account that what the trial judge was really doing
    was dissolving a constructive trust that had served its purpose.  In my view,
    the fact that Mr. Vered derived a benefit from the dissolution is of no consequence
    particularly in view of the trial judge’s comments (already quoted above)
    at paragraph 13 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Ron International was contributed by Ron Canada
    and Mr. Vered to the Joint Venture as the vehicle through which the Joint
    Venture would operate.  The Joint Venture Agreement was totally silent on
    the issue of ownership of the shares of the Joint Venture vehicle, Ron International,
    once all loans had been repaid, expenses paid and profits distributed.  There
    was no perceived residual economic value to the shares.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    counsel for the appellant argued that Mr. Vered was in breach of his obligation
    to the joint venture in failing to make timely financial disclosure to the
    appellant and failed to organize the financial affairs of the joint venture
    in such a way as to provide equivalent benefits to Mr. Reichmann by means
    of tax losses.  In my view, these arguments have no merit.  While disclosure
    was apparently withheld from the appellant for a period of time, he eventually
    received the disclosure he required and more importantly, the monies to which
    he was entitled.  In respect of Mr. Vered’s failure to manage the financial
    affairs of the joint venture in order to provide an equivalent tax benefit
    to Mr. Reichmann, there is simply no evidence to suggest that he should or
    could have done so.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Underlying
    all of the arguments of the appellant is the simple proposition that the
    trial judge had no jurisdiction to discharge or dissolve a constructive trust
    previously imposed in earlier proceedings.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Soulos
      v. Korkontzilas</i>, McLachlin J. at para. 34 said, when speaking of the
      importance of a constructive trust:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Equitable remedies are flexible, when their award
    is based on what is just in all the circumstances of the case.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>It seems to me that this applies
    equally to the dissolution of a constructive trust that had served its purpose
    and is no longer necessary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    also find support for this approach in <i>Pettkus v. Becker</i> at pages
    847-848 where Dickson J.  observed:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The great advantage of ancient principles of equity
    is their flexibility: the judiciary is thus able to shape these malleable
    principles so as to accommodate the changing needs and mores of society,
    in order to achieve justice.  The constructive trust has proven to be a useful
    tool in the judicial armoury.  See <i>Babrociak v. Babrociak</i> (1978),
    1 R.F.L. (2nd) 95 (Ont. C.A.); <i>Re Spears and Levy et al</i> (1975), 52
    D.L.R. (3d) 146 (N.S.C.A.); <i>Douglas v. Guaranty Trust Company of Canada</i> (1978),
    8 R.F.L. (2nd) 98 (Ont. H.C.); <i>Armstrong v. Armstrong</i> (1978), 93 D.L.R.
    (3d) 128 (Ont. H.C.).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    there does not appear to be any Canadian authority directly on point, I find
    the theory advanced by A. J. Oakley in his text, <i>Constructive Trusts</i>,
    referred to above is persuasive.  It seems to me that since the appellant
    chose to pursue his claim for his share of the profits of the joint venture
    against the constructive trustee directly that the receipt of payment from
    the trustee should in the circumstances of this case at least, have the effect
    of discharging whatever proprietary rights the appellant may have had in
    the shares of Ron International.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    may well be cases where the beneficiary has a claim against the constructive
    trustee and a proprietary claim to the subject-matter of the constructive
    trust.  However, this is not one of those cases.</p>
