      is a matrimonial home and subject to equalization upon separation pursuant
      to the provisions of the <i>Family Law Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, C. F.3 (the <i>FLA</i>).  There
      is no issue on this appeal that the cottage property owned by the appellant’s
      numbered company was ordinarily occupied as a residence by him and his
      spouse.  The issue is whether the trial judge erred in holding that the
      appellant had an interest in the cottage property sufficient to render
      it a matrimonial home pursuant to the <i>FLA</i>. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span

    further issue is whether, in valuing Lifestyles, a group of corporations
    owned by the appellant at the date of marriage, the trial judge erred in
    accepting the expert evidence of the valuator for the respondent as to the
    multiple to be used in determining the value of the business. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, the appellant appeals both the award of retroactive child support
    in the amount of $951,346 as well as the ongoing child support of $23,000
    per month he was ordered to pay, and the costs, fixed in the amount of $2.25-million,
    inclusive of a premium of $150,000, awarded against him.  The respondent
    cross-appeals from the award of prejudgment interest in the amount of $2.4-million
    and seeks a higher amount. </p>

    issue relating to ownership of money withdrawn from two trading accounts
    in the respondent’s name was abandoned at the outset of this appeal.  Similarly,
    a motion to dismiss the appellant’s appeal for failing to comply with a court
    order to post additional security was dismissed as, at the date of hearing
    this appeal, he had posted additional security. </p>

    of the facts will suffice to give context to the issues raised here.  The

    December 1986, the respondent moved into the appellant’s home and on April
    3, 1987, they went through a religious wedding ceremony but did not obtain
    a licence to marry.  Their union produced one child, born in 1989.  In 1994,
    the respondent had an intimate relationship with a contractor who had been
    hired to work on the parties’ home.  She consulted a matrimonial lawyer.  After
    the relationship with the contractor ended the respondent and the appellant
    went through a civil marriage ceremony on July 20, 1994.  On September 11,
    1995, they separated and have been involved in litigation ever since. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    October 19, 1993, 1048762 Ontario Limited, a company in which the appellant
    was the sole shareholder, purchased a cottage property as an investment.  The
    appellant provided all the funding.  The trial judge stated at para. 34 of
    her reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The wife testified as to her understanding that
    the cottage was held in a numbered company because it was intended to be
    an investment.  They were not sure, according to her, whether they would
    like owning a cottage, in which event they might flip it and make a profit.  However,
    after the renovations were completed and the family started to use it, there
    was no further discussion about selling it. </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>The trial judge then discussed the
    use that had been made of the cottage by the family and commented at para.
    39:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The wife kept a list of expenditures that she incurred
    on the cottage property including the carrying costs, which were paid for
    from the parties’ joint account.  The renovations which were mainly paid
    for by Lifestyles, were the subject of a re-assessment by CCRA and the expenses
    were disallowed as a business expense. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her findings regarding the cottage,<b> </b>the trial judge stated at paras.
    367-68: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The parties ordinarily used the cottage as an all
    season recreational residence at both the date of the civil marriage and
    the date of separation.  They entertained family and friends at the cottage.  It
    was maintained from the joint bank account.  As such, it comes within the
    definition of “matrimonial home” in s. 18(1) of the Family Law Act.  (<i>Berdette
    v. Berdette</i> (1988), 66 O.R. (2d) 410 (Ont. H.C.); <i>Reeson v. Kowalik</i> (1991),
    36 R.F.L. (3d) 396 (Ont. Gen. Div.)). </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The fact that the parties may have considered the
    cottage an investment at the time they purchased it, that title was put in
    a numbered company, that Lifestyles paid for the renovations (which were
    subsequently found to be personal expenses and disallowed as a business expense)
    and that the cottage was used on one occasion for a meeting of Lifestyles’ distributors,
    do not render this property a business asset.  Accordingly, no deduction
    may be taken for this property at the date of the marriage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ordinarily,
    property owned by a spouse at the date of marriage is excluded from the calculation
    of their net family property on marriage breakdown under s. 4 of the <i>FLA.  </i>Because
    the matrimonial home is a unique asset, the value of a matrimonial home owned
    on the date of marriage is not excluded from the calculation of net family
    property under the Act.  The trial judge found that the cottage came within
    the definition of a “matrimonial home” pursuant to s. 18(1) of the <i>FLA</i>,
    Which provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>Every property in which a person
      has an interest and that is or, if the spouses have separated, was at the
      time of separation ordinarily occupied by the person and his or her spouse
      as their family residence is their matrimonial home. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jurisprudence relied on by the trial judge and her reasons deal with the
    issue of whether the property was “ordinarily occupied by the person and
    his or her spouse as their family residence” within the meaning of s. 18(1).  On
    this appeal, the appellant does not contest the trial judge’s conclusion
    that the cottage was ordinarily occupied by the parties as their residence.  He
    does, however, contest the implicit finding of the trial judge that he had “an
    interest” in the property. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that as a shareholder has no interest in the assets of
    a corporation, he had no interest in the cottage.  Rather, it is his ownership
    of the shares in the company that are subject to equalization.  Using this
    approach, the value of the shares of the company as at the date of marriage
    would be deducted from his net family property.  Only the increase in value
    of the shares of the corporation from the date of the marriage to the date
    of separation would be used to calculate net family property.  Assuming that
    as of the date of marriage the value of the shares was equal to its sole
    asset, the cottage, the value of the shares at the date of marriage would
    be $840,000.  At the date of separation the cottage had a value of $1-million.  Thus,
    the difference of $160,000 would be subject to equalization.  As a result
    the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in piercing the corporate
    veil and in valuing the cottage as a matrimonial home whose entire value
    of $1 million dollars at the date of separation was subject to equalization
    and part of the appellant’s net family property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
      question of whether the appellant has an interest in the cottage property
      requires me to consider how s. 18(2) of the <i>Family Law Act</i> and its
      statutory predecessor, s. 39(3) of the <i>Family Law Reform Act</i> (R.S.O.
      1980, c. 152) (the <i>FLRA</i>), should be interpreted.  As well, the evolving
      jurisprudence at common law as to when a court is entitled to pierce the
      corporate veil must be considered. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsection
    18(2) provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>The ownership of a share or shares,
      or of an interest in a share or shares, of a corporation entitling the
      owner to occupy a housing unit owned by the corporation shall be deemed
      to be an interest in the unit for the purposes of subsection (1). </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that s. 18(2) primarily applies to a situation where a
    matrimonial home is a co-operative apartment or where the purpose of putting
    the home in the name of the corporation is to defeat the <i>FLA.</i>  In
    this regard, the appellant’s submission echoes the obiter comments of the
    motion judge in <i>CMLQ Investors Co. v. 530995 Ontario Ltd.</i> (1995),
    17 R.F.L. (4<span style='font-family:&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>th</span>) 313 (Ont. Ct. J. (Gen. Div.)).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree with this interpretation.  The plain wording of the subsection does
    not limit a spouse’s interest to a condominium or co-operative apartment
    and I can think of no reason to so limit it in this manner.  The simple device
    of holding a house in the name of a personally owned corporation prior to
    the date of marriage would deprive the other spouse of the rights associated
    with the matrimonial home: an equal right to possession; the requirement
    that the consent of the other spouse to alienate or encumber the home be
    obtained; and the full value of the home being included in the calculation
    of a spouse’s net family property on separation.  Such an interpretation
    would defeat the desired effect of the <i>FLA</i>, which regards the matrimonial
    home as a unique asset and gives it special treatment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Mancini
      v. Mancini</i> (1982), 31 R.F.L. (2d) 418 (Ont. Unif. Fam.Ct.),<i> </i>Steinberg
      U.F.C.J. interpreted s. 39(2) of the <i>FLRA,</i> a provision nearly identical
      to the present s. 18(2) of the <i>FLA.</i>  He focused on the phrase “entitling
      the owner to occupy a housing unit,” and held that if the owner of a share
      or shares in the corporation has a controlling interest so as to enable
      him to vote his shares so as to give him a right of residence, then the
      owner has an
    “interest” in the property for the purposes of the statute.  In other words,
    legal control over the corporation amounts to legal control over the residence
    for the purposes of the matrimonial home provisions.  Alternatively, he held
    that if a company has passed a resolution entitling its owner to reside in
    the home, it would be a matrimonial home.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

        39 O.R. (3d) 609,</span><i> </i>property owned by the husband’s company
        had granted him a lease.  Rosenberg J.A. held that as a leasehold interest
        was an interest in property pursuant to s. 18(1), the house was a matrimonial
        home.  As a result, he found it unnecessary to consider s. 18(2); however,
        he commented with respect to <i>Mancini</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It may well be that as argued by the appellant,
    in view of [the husband’s] control over the shares of Riviera he also had “an
    interest” in the property as a result of s. 18(2).</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that this court ought not to adopt the reasoning in <i>Mancini</i>.  He
    submits that the wife indirectly benefited from the incorporation of the
    company<i> </i>and that<span style='color:black'> the principle articulated

    that principle holds that in deciding whether to lift the corporate veil,

    should bear the corresponding burdens. </p>

      v. Wildman,</i> [2006] O.J. No. 3966 (C.A.), this court recently rejected
      the argument that if the wife indirectly benefited from the property being
      held by the corporation, she should now have to bear the burden of incorporation
      and the court should refuse to pierce the corporate veil.  MacPherson J.A.
      observed that it was the husband alone who chose the benefit of incorporation
      and he, as well as the wife, enjoyed those benefits.  To maintain the corporate
      structure in these circumstances means that the wife alone would bear the
      burden of incorporation and would not be fair.  That reasoning assists
      in the interpretation of s. 18(2). </p>

    interpretation of s. 18(2) I propose also accords with the evolving common
    law jurisprudence as to when the corporate veil should be pierced.  Simply
    put, there is no one all-encompassing rule as to when a court will pierce
    the corporate veil.  A contextual approach is required.  A court will not
    enforce the “separate entities” principle when it would yield a result too
    flagrantly opposed to justice, convenience or would defeat the desired effect
    of legislation: See <i>Kosmopoulos</i>, <i>supra </i>at para 12; <i>Transamerica
    Life Insurance Co. of Canada v. Canada Life Assurance Co.</i> (1996), 28
    O.R. (3d) 423, (Gen Div.) at para. 21, affirmed [1997] O.J. No. 3754 (C.A.); <i>642947
    Ontario Ltd. v. Fleischer </i>(2001), 56 O.R. (3d) 417 at para. 69 (C.A.).  Here
    the interpretation proposed by the appellant would defeat the desired effect
    of the legislation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    important consideration that affects whether the corporate veil will be pierced
    is whether the interests of third parties would be affected: <i>Kosmopoulos,
    supra </i>at para. 14. That consideration assists in explaining the result
    in <i>Rohani, supra, </i>a decision relied on by the appellant’s counsel
    that is distinguishable on its facts.  In <i>Rohani</i> the husband<i> </i>was
    not the sole shareholder or director of the company in issue and the company
    was merely used by him to participate in a much larger business enterprise
    that involved other owners.  Similarly, third party interests would have
    been adversely affected by piercing the corporate veil in <i>CMLQ</i>,<i> supra, </i>and
    in <i><span style='color:black'>Mancini</span></i><span
style='color:black'>, <i>supra</i>.  These cases illustrate the point made by
    Rosenberg J.A. in <i>Manufacturers Life Insurance Co. v. Riviera Farm Holdings
    Ltd.</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para 19 that “the nature of the interest that
    a court may be prepared to recognize will depend on the particular circumstances
    and the purpose for which the spouse seeks to rely on s. 18.” </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    unlike in <i>CMLQ, Mancini, </i>and <i>Rohani,</i> the husband is the sole
    shareholder and director of the corporation and there is no concern that
    piercing the corporate veil may adversely affect the interests of innocent
    third parties. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the appellant’s argument that s. 18(2) should not apply where
    the property was not placed under corporate ownership for the purpose of
    defeating the <i>FLA</i>, the reasoning in <i>Wildman</i> is again instructive.  The
    principal issue in <i>Wildman</i> was whether the trial judge erred in ordering
    all amounts owed by the husband for support to be secured and enforceable
    not only against his personal assets but also against his corporation.  In
    upholding the trial judge’s decision to pierce the corporate veil, MacPherson
    J.A. rejected the same argument advanced here, namely, that if the <i>purpose</i> of
    placing the asset in the corporation’s name was not a fraudulent or improper
    one, the corporate veil should not be pierced.  Rather, he held that the
    history of how a spouse sets up his business affairs is a relevant, but not
    a controlling, factor in resolving the financial issues in a matrimonial
    case.  The purpose of incorporation is a starting point.  The real focus
    must be on how the corporation is <i>used</i>.  See paras. 35-41. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Wildman</i>,
    the corporation was solely owned and controlled by the husband.  He used
    the corporation to minimize his personal income while at the same time using
    corporate funds for personal purposes.  MacPherson J. A. held that the corporation
    was the husband’s alter ego.  The husband was using the corporation to defeat
    the interests of his wife and their children to the money various courts
    had found they should receive.  The husband’s use of his company’s funds
    amounted to misconduct in the broad sense.  MacPherson J.A. held it would
    be flagrantly opposed to justice to allow the husband to hide behind the
    corporate veil. </p>

    the appeal before us, the appellant is the sole shareholder and controls
    the numbered company.  This company did not pay for the renovations and did
    not pay the ongoing expenses for the cottage property.  Money from the couple’s
    joint bank account was used to pay ongoing expenses.  The appellant’s attempt
    to deduct expenses related to the cottage as a business expense was rejected.  The
    corporation is the <i>alter ego </i>of the husband and is being used by him
    to try to defeat the legitimate claim of his wife.  As in <i>Wildman, supra, </i>the
    husband ought not to be allowed to hide behind the corporate veil. </p>

    1988, the husband started a multilevel marketing company making diet products
    and nutraceuticals.  It was profitable from the outset and he continued to
    grow and expand the business in other countries.  There were no comparable
    companies at either the valuation date or the date of the marriage.  In order
    to determine the value of the companies, known as the Lifestyles Group, both
    valuators used <span

    the amount of maintainable earnings the business can generate and multiplying
    this amount by an earnings multiple to determine its fair market value. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Rudson, the husband’s valuator, valued Lifestyles as being worth $19,800,000
    at the date of marriage and $13,560,000 at the date of separation about fourteen
    months later.  He used a multiple of 3.5 to 4.0 both at the date of marriage
    and at the date of separation.  The trial judge rejected his evidence because
    his conclusions “on a number of significant matters were shown to be inaccurate
    and misleading because he was not in receipt of all of the relevant information…”  She
    further found, “The husband’s deliberate obfuscation and failure to disclose
    infected Mr. Rudson’s work”.  For example, Rudson made a $3.7-million error
    with respect to how marketable securities were booked in Lifestyles Canada’s
    financial statements, thereby lowering the appellant’s net family property.  The
    trial judge concluded that the evidence of Mr. DeBresser, the respondent’s
    valuator, was more reliable. </p>

    there was no significant change in the income of Lifestyles between the date
    of the marriage and the date of separation, DeBresser applied a lower multiple
    to the company at the date of marriage (2.75-3), and a higher multiple at
    the date of separation (4.0-4.25).  The result was that his valuation of
    the business was $15,233,000 at the date of marriage and $21,005,000 at the
    date of separation.  <span lang=EN-GB>The increase in value is almost entirely

      determining the appropriate multiple for each date, DeBresser used his
      professional judgment. He relied specifically on two factors to explain
      the increase in the multiple. The first was that, at the date of marriage,
      Lifestyles Canada (one of the entities that comprised the Lifestyles Group)
      was facing a charge under the <i>Competition Act</i>,<i> </i>as were three
      of its<i> </i>distributors. The charges were settled two weeks after the
      marriage. The second factor affecting the multiple was DeBresser’s opinion
      as to the Lifestyle Group’s ability to repeat its level of earnings during
      the year of marriage. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-GB>Regarding
      the <i>Competition Act </i>charges, at the date of marriage, one charge
      was pending against Lifestyles Canada and 11 charges were pending against
      3 major distributors of Lifestyles. The charges were the first ever laid
      pursuant to amendments to the <i>Act</i> designed to regulate multi-level
      marketing entities.</span> Those charged faced a maximum penalty of $200,000
      per charge and/or imprisonment.  Lifestyles’
    solicitor had expressed concern that the distributors were the “lifeblood
    of the company.”  Two weeks after the date of the marriage, Lifestyles Canada
    reached a settlement whereby it pleaded guilty to its charge and paid a $35,000
    fine; the charges against the distributors were withdrawn. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>DeBresser
    testified that the appellant refused to answer questions during his examination
    for discovery regarding the <i>Competition Act </i>charges, which forced
    DeBresser to consider the range of possible outcomes.  In his opinion, the
    litigation risk weighed down the multiple at the date of marriage and conversely
    the absence of risk elevated the multiple at the valuation date.  The appellant
    testified at trial that as at the date of marriage a settlement of the charges
    had been reached.  The trial judge rejected the appellant’s evidence that
    the litigation was settled at the date of the marriage and accepted DeBresser’s
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regarding
    the sustainability of earnings, DeBresser was of the opinion that a further
    year of sustained profits reduced the risk for a potential purchaser and
    therefore justified a higher multiple. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this point, the trial judge rejected the evidence of the appellant and his
    business partner that the sales of Lifestyles diminished as a result of problems
    with its main product “Intra”, as their evidence was not credible or supported
    by any documentation.  She accepted DeBresser’s evidence that the maintainable
    earnings were between $4.7 million and $5.3 million but lowered the latter
    amount by making an adjustment that resulted in it being $5,100,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s findings are at paras. 356-360 of her reasons and are reproduced
    below:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='color:black'>I accept the multiple
      chosen by Mr. DeBresser for the date of marriage.  I do not agree with
      Mr. Rudson's view that the impact of the pending charges against Lifestyles
      was limited to the maximum fine under the <i>Competition Act</i>.  Mr.
      Drutz testified to the mobility and lack of loyalty of distributors in
      multi-level marketing businesses.  Eleven charges pending against three
      major distributors of Lifestyles would have created uncertainty in a potential
      buyer about the distributorship base, the &quot;lifeblood of the company&quot;.  Pending
      criminal charges can also affect reputation which is important to any company.  These
      uncertainties would have made it difficult to know how much to put aside
      as an indemnity.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='color:black'>The critical issue is
      whether there is justification for increasing the multiple 14 months later
      at the date of separation, as a result of the resolution of the Competition
      Act charges and another year of profits.  I prefer Mr. DeBresser's view
      that there should be a higher multiple at the date of separation for the
      following reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='color:black'>I draw an adverse inference
      against the husband on the issue of whether by the date of the marriage,
      a deal had been worked out on the <i>Competition Act</i> charges.  The
      correspondence which Mr. Drutz acknowledged existed between Lifestyles
      and its lawyer was not produced nor was Lifestyles' lawyer, Mr. Nuttall,
      called to testify as to what occurred at the various stages of the negotiations.  I
      note that the husband refused to answer any questions regarding the <i>Competition
      Act</i> charges until trial.  I reject the evidence of Mr. Drutz as self-serving.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='color:black'>Given the huge increase
      in profits in the year of marriage, I find that a further year of sustained
      profits would have allayed concerns in a potential buyer that the profits
      could not be repeated.  This fact would definitely warrant an increase
      in the multiple.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='color:black'>Mr. Rudson's suggestion
      that it was a negative factor that profits did not grow further in the
      14-month period following the marriage may have some theoretical validity.  However,
      this is not a case of a publicly traded company where there is a large
      multiple based on the expectation of continued growth.  This was a relatively
      young, small, privately owned company for whom the increased certainty
      of earnings at this level on a sustained basis would justify the increase
      in the multiple that Mr. DeBresser attributed to it.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted earlier in these reasons, the appellant does not seek to set aside
    the trial judge’s findings respecting the appellant’s credibility or non-disclosure.  At
    paras. 346, 350 and 351 of her reasons the trial judge stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I have rejected the husband’s evidence as not worthy
    of credit.  It follows that, to the extent that Mr. Rudson’s opinion is based
    on what the husband told him, it must also be rejected by me. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>[. . .]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, Mr. Rudson fell short of the independence
    required of an expert witness.  It seems that the husband’s deliberate obfuscation
    and failure to disclose infected Mr. Rudson’s work. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I have concluded that DeBresser’s evidence is more
    reliable and I accept it in preference to Mr. Rudson’s evidence, except where
    specifically noted. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    addressing the appellant’s submissions concerning the trial judge’s findings
    of fact and the inferences she drew, I will make brief reference to the standard
    of review.  In <i>Toneguzzo-Norvell (Guardian ad litem of) v. Burnaby Hospital</i>,<i> </i>[1994]
    1 S.C.R. 114, the Supreme Court addressed the standard of review for an appellate
    court regarding a trial judge’s findings of fact based on inferences drawn
    from conflicting testimony of expert witnesses.  The appellant relies on
    a portion of the reasons of McLachlin J. (writing on behalf of the Court)
    for the submission that the deference ordinarily applicable to a trial judge’s
    findings of fact and inferences does not apply with the same force to inferences
    drawn from conflicting expert testimony.  This submission does not accurately
    reflect McLachlin J.’s holding in <i>Toneguzzo</i>.  In <i>Housen v. Nikolaison </i>at
    para. 24 the majority cited the relevant passage in <i>Toneguzzo</i> from
    pp. 121-22 of the reasons of McLachlin J.:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A Court of Appeal is clearly not entitled to interfere
    merely because it takes a different view of the evidence.  <u>The finding
    of fact and the drawing of evidentiary conclusions from facts is the province
    of the trial judge not the Court of Appeal. </u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I agree that the principle of non-intervention
    of a Court of Appeal in a trial judge’s findings of facts does not apply
    with the same force to inferences drawn from conflicting testimony of expert
    witnesses where the credibility of these witnesses is not in issue.  This
    does not however, change the fact that the weight to be assigned to the various
    pieces of evidence is under our trial system essentially the province of
    the trier of fact, in this case the trial judge.  [Emphasis added by Iacobucci
    and Major JJ.]</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:
normal'>The majority then stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>We take the above comments of McLachlin J. to mean
    that, although the same high standard of deference applies to the entire
    range of factual determinations made by the trial judge, where a factual
    finding is grounded in an assessment of credibility of a witness, the overwhelming
    advantage of the trial judge in this area must be acknowledged.  This does
    not, however, imply that there is a lower standard of review where witness
    credibility is not in issue, or that there are not numerous policy reasons
    supporting deference to all factual conclusions of the trial judge.  In our
    view, this is made clear by the underlined portion of the above passage.  The
    essential point is that making a factual conclusion of any kind, is inextricably
    linked with assigning weight to evidence, and thus attracts a deferential
    standard of review. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    majority then observed at para. 25 that other areas in which the trial judge
    enjoys an advantage include the trial judge’s relative expertise with respect
    to weighing and assessing evidence, the trial judge’s familiarity with what
    are often vast quantities of evidence, and the judge’s exposure to the entire
    factual nexus of the case.  These and other policy reasons led the majority
    to conclude that a deferential approach applies to inferences of fact and
    that “there is one, and only one, standard of review applicable to all factual
    conclusions made by the trial judge…that of palpable and overriding error.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    these comments in mind, I now propose to deal with the appellant’s submissions
    respecting the valuation of Lifestyles.  The first submission is that there
    was no objective support for DeBresser’s conclusion that the company’s value
    had risen by $8.2-million in 14 months.  The second is that the trial judge
    did not correctly use hindsight to test the assumptions of the valuator and
    did not consistently apply the hindsight principle to all of the evidence
    before her.  The appellant submits that the settlement under the <i>Competition
    Act </i>ought to have been used to test the reasonableness of DeBresser’s
    assumptions.  Third, the appellant challenges DeBresser’s reliance on Lifestyle’s
    duplication of its most profitable year.  I will deal with these factors
    in inverse order.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>i.             DeBresser’s
      Reliance on Repeat Performance</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    selecting the multiple of earnings for the date of marriage, DeBresser stated
    he was “particularly influenced” by the lack of a track record for sales
    and earnings at the levels experienced during fiscal 1994.  In selecting
    the multiple for the valuation date at the date of separation, DeBresser
    cited the trend of revenues and earnings since 1992, the stabilization of
    sales and earnings levels during the most recent fiscal year, and the ability
    of Lifestyles Group to repeat its unprecedented results first achieved during
    fiscal 1994.  The trial judge was entitled to adopt DeBresser’s opinion,
    and this court defers to her decision to do so.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ii.        The <i>Competition

    respect to the <i>Competition Act </i>charges, the appellant<span lang=EN-US> submits
    that it is open to a trial judge to use factual hindsight information to
    determine whether or not subsequent events confirm the reasonableness of
    the assumptions made by the valuator.  To support this argument, the appellant
    relies on two cases: <i>Domglas Inc. v. Jarislowsky, Fraser &amp;
    Co.</i> (1980), 13 B.L.R. 135 (Que. Sup. Ct.), and <i>Ford Motor Co. of Canada
    v. Ontario (Municipal Employees Retirement Board)</i> (2000), 48 C.P.C. (4th)
    272 (Ont. S.C.J.).  Both of these cases involve disputes between a company’s
    minority and majority shareholders.  In both, the majority shareholder re-structured
    the company in a manner that required the majority to purchase the minority’s
    shares.  In order to determine a fair price for the shares, it was necessary
    to determine the fair market value of the company.</span></p>

      general principle that emerges from both <i>Domglas, supra, </i>and <i>Ford,
      supra,</i> is that hindsight information is generally inadmissible and
      cannot be used as part of the process of establishing the value of shares
      at a particular date.  An exception to this principle is that hindsight,
      or the actual results achieved after the valuation date, maybe compared
      against the projected or forecasted corporate results made by valuators
      and used to test the reasonableness of the assumptions made by those valuators.  </span></p>

    case that is particularly relevant to the current appeal is <i>Martin</i>, <i>supra</i>.  In
    that case, the court had to determine the fair market value of a parcel of
    land owned by one of the spouses.  At the date of marriage, the land was
    zoned agricultural.  By the valuation date, the land had been re-zoned commercial,
    but the re-zoning by-law was under appeal to the Ontario Municipal Board
    and it faced considerable opposition.  Notwithstanding this opposition, the
    appeal was dismissed a year after the valuation date.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, one of the appraisers had valued the land without considering the
    appeal, while the other appraiser valued the land as if the re-zoning would
    fail.  In his reasons, the trial judge agreed with the second appraisal,
    noting at para. 15: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A prudent purchaser on [the V-date] would have
    been buying land of which the rezoning … was the subject of a hotly contested
    appeal; he would, in effect, have been buying a lawsuit in this regard.  There
    was no knowledge at that time whether the appeal would be successful or unsuccessful.  The
    fact that it proved to be unsuccessful a year after separation cannot be
    taken into account.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Martin</i> adopts
    the approach to the use of hindsight information that conforms to the general
    principle that one must base valuation on the knowledge available at the
    valuation date.  The first appraiser’s reliance on the ultimate outcome of
    the appeal was unreasonable because a prudent purchaser would not have paid
    the higher purchase price for commercially zoned land at that time, as he
    could not be certain he would be able to use the land for commercial purposes.</p>

      other exceptions may evolve from the jurisprudence over time, I would adopt </span>the <i>Ford</i> articulation
      of the hindsight rule and the exception I have discussed for valuations
      under the <i>Family Law Act</i>.  In both corporate law and family law,
      where the goal is to determine the fair market value of the business, perfect
      accuracy is impossible.  As Viscount Simon wrote in <i>Gold Coast Selection
      Trust Ltd. v. Humphrey (Inspector of Taxes)</i>, [1948] A.C. 459 at 473
      (H.L.), “Valuation is an art, not an exact science.  Mathematical certainty
      is not demanded, nor indeed is it possible.”  The valuator must make assumptions
      as to how a prospective purchaser would have evaluated the business based
      on the purchaser’s knowledge at the time in question and the amount of
      risk the purchaser would likely have been willing to assume concerning
      a lawsuit.  Hindsight information is not admissible on the question of
      whether that assumption was <i>correct</i> but, as indicated in <i>Ford,
      supra, </i>it can be used to test whether that assumption was <i>reasonable</i>.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the present case, the appellant submits that the state of knowledge of a
    prospective purchaser at the date of marriage would have included the fact
    that several meetings had been held by counsel for the appellant with those
    responsible for the prosecution of the <i>Competition Act </i>charges.  However,
    there is no evidence as to what was said at those meetings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge considered the state of knowledge regarding the outcome of the <i>Competition
    Act</i> charges when she found that DeBresser’s assumptions were reasonable.  The
    trial judge’s findings, in para. 358 of her reasons reproduced above, clearly
    demonstrate that she rejected the appellant’s evidence that the charges had
    been effectively settled on the date of marriage.  She noted the lack of
    credible evidence to support this assertion.  The trial judge assessed the
    state of knowledge of a prospective purchaser on the date of marriage regarding
    the charges and determined that the settlement was not yet imminent.  On
    the evidence that was and wasn’t before her, particularly the lack of credible
    evidence that the settlement was imminent on the date of marriage, she was
    entitled to make the finding that the settlement was not yet imminent.  This
    finding, in turn, supports her adoption of DeBresser’s lower earnings multiple.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s submissions amount to an argument that the settlement alone is <i>conclusive</i> evidence
    that the charges were irrelevant to the valuation on the date of marriage.  As
    the jurisprudence put forward by the parties demonstrates, the test for the
    trial judge was whether DeBresser’s assumptions were reasonable and she was
    entitled to conclude that they were. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    will now deal with the argument that the trial judge did not adopt a consistent
    approach towards hindsight.  On valuation day, the fact that CCRA was going
    to conduct an audit of Lifestyles, the amount of understated income that
    had to be added back and the fact that certain expenses would also be added
    back to the company were not known.  DeBresser said the income on valuation
    day was understated.  With the benefit of hindsight from the CCRA audit,
    DeBresser increased the income by adding $583,263 to the company’s income.  That
    allocation was accepted by the trial judge and was used in determining the
    maintainable earnings.  Yet when dealing with the <i>Competition Act</i> charges
    the trial judge rejected the use of hindsight. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    further argument can be disposed of quickly.  The trial judge was of the
    opinion that a vendor would disclose the hidden income in order to increase
    the value of the business he was selling.  Further, the facts as to the company’s
    income were known on the valuation day; they were simply hidden by DeBora.  He
    knew that the sales were being understated at valuation day.  Thus, DeBora’s
    knowledge was not hindsight.  The trial judge did not apply the hindsight
    principle in an inconsistent or inappropriate manner. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    DeBresser was proffering an assumption with respect to risk and value and
    he admitted that his determination of the multiples, particularly at the
    date of marriage, was based on his judgment.  That judgment was, however,
    based on a list of objective factors outlined in his report including a survey
    of literature respecting nutraceuticals and general industry conditions.  There
    is no question that the settlement of the charges under the <i>Competition
    Act </i>and the repetition of the outstanding earnings reduced the risk to
    the Lifestyle Canada’s maintainable earnings as of the date of separation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would dismiss this ground of appeal.  The trial judge was entitled to accept
    DeBresser’s evidence as to the sustainability of Lifestyles’ earnings on
    the date of separation and the risk to the company from the charges under
    the <i>Competition Act</i> at the date of marriage and the corresponding
    multiples he chose.  Nor did the trial judge err in the manner in which she
    applied the hindsight principle.  Finally, DeBresser was entitled to use
    his judgment in proffering his opinion.</p>

    trial judge held at para. 416 of her reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The husband misrepresented his income during the
    course of this action.  As a result, the amount of child support that he
    paid was lower than it should have been.  I accept the wife’s evidence that
    she exhausted her savings and went into debt to support the children and
    herself prior to the increase in child support [of $23,000 per month effective
    July 1, 2001,] ordered by Justice Greer. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    one five-month exception, from the date of separation in September 1995 until
    July 2001, the husband paid the wife $10,000 a month for the support of the
    three children living with her.  The amount did not vary depending on the
    number of children living with her at a given time. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent’s claim for retroactive child support was made from February&nbsp;1996
    to the date of Greer J.’s order in July 2001.  The trial judge found that
    on a conservative estimate, the husband’s income for this period exceeded
    $3-million net of taxes each year, the equivalent of approximately $5.5-million
    Canadian gross income, and that he certainly had the ability to pay the retroactive
    support claimed.  She noted that the <i>Federal Child Support Guidelines </i>came
    into effect in May 1997 and recognized that prior to this time the amount
    of child support may have been lower.  She concluded that the amount of retroactive
    child support sought, namely, $23,000 a month as had been ordered by Greer
    J., was lower than the amount that would have been awarded on a strict application
    of the <i>Guidelines </i>but that the amount claimed was nonetheless reasonable
    for the pre-<i>Guidelines </i>period. </p>

    appellant submits that during the fifteen months the <i>Guidelines </i>were
    not in force, the trial judge lacked the jurisdiction to award net child
    support and that any such order could only be made on a gross basis.  The
    appellant further submits that the trial judge’s award of retroactive support
    as a whole was excessive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the release of the trial judge’s reasons, and shortly before this appeal
    was heard, the Supreme Court of Canada released its decision in four appeals
    that raised the issue of retroactive child support: <i>D.B.S. v. S.R.G.;
    L.J.W. v. T.A.R.; Henry v. Henry; Hiemstra v. Hiemstra, </i>2006 SCC 37.  I
    propose to use this decision as the framework for my comments concerning
    the appellant’s submissions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first consideration in determining retroactive support is the prevailing
    legislation and child support scheme: <i>D.B.S.</i>,<i> supra</i>, at<i> </i>paras.
    40-54. Here, the prevailing legislative scheme from February 1996 to May
    1997 was primarily based on the needs of the children and the ability of
    the parents to pay and was shared in proportion to their incomes.  However,
    even before the enactment of the guidelines, child support extended well
    beyond the obligation to provide necessities.  <i>D.B.S., supra</i>, at para.
    40. After May&nbsp;1997, the <i>Federal Child Support Guidelines</i>, a scheme
    that is not purely needs-based, were in force.  The Guidelines create a freestanding
    obligation to pay child support with the total amount fluctuating based on
    the payor parent’s income.  At para. 45 of his reasons, Bastarache J., writing
    for the majority of the court, explained: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[A] parent’s increase in income will not only increase
    his/her <i>share </i>of the child support burden; it will increase the <i>total
    amount </i>of support owed....[U]nder the general <i>Guidelines </i>regime,
    the underlying theory is that the support obligation itself should fluctuate
    with the payor parent’s income.…  [W]hen a payor parent does not increase
    the amount of his/her support when his/her income increases it is the <i>child</i> who
    loses[.] [Emphasis in original.] </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Further, at para. 54, the
    court held, “Thus, under the federal scheme, a payor parent who does not
    increase his/her child support payments to correspond with his/her income
    will not have fulfilled his/her obligation to his/her children.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Upon
    separation, children are entitled, as much as possible, to the same standard
    of living they enjoyed when their parents were together.  After separation,
    the children’s lifestyle was not commensurate with the appellant’s income.  His
    financial statement at trial indicated an income of just over $500,000, less
    than one-tenth of what the trial judge found to be his minimum income.  In
    dealing with the situation where, as here, a court order for child support
    did not exist during the relevant time over which retroactive support is
    claimed, and where, based on the payor parent’s income, child support has
    been underpaid, the court stated at para. 80 of <i>D.B.S.</i>, <i>supra</i>: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[A]bsent special circumstances (e.g. hardship or <i>ad
      hoc </i>sharing of expenses with the custodial parent), it becomes unreasonable
      for the non-custodial parent to believe (s)he was acquitting him/herself
      of his/her obligations towards his/her children.  The non-custodial parent’s
      interest in certainty is generally not very compelling here. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>The court also noted at
    para. 81 that under s. 15.1 of the <i>Divorce Act, </i>the statute in issue
    here, there is no restriction as to the date from which the court may order
    that the award take effect and it was open to courts to enforce obligations
    that predated an order for support.  Thus, the trial judge had the jurisdiction
    to award child support for the period that pre-dated the coming into force
    of the <i>Guidelines</i> and to make the award of retroactive support that
    she did. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>D.B.S., </i>Bastarache
    J. opined at para. 123 that ordinarily a retroactive order for support should
    not be longer than three years and should run from the date when effective
    notice of a request for increased support was given to the payor parent.  However,
    where the payor parent has engaged in blameworthy conduct, the presumptive
    date of the award is, as he stated at para. 134, “ the date when circumstances
    changed materially”, that is, when the payor parent’s income increased.  Having
    regard to the payor parent’s misconduct in concealing his income, and the
    length of time over which he did so, the length of the award of retroactive
    support awarded by the trial judge can be sustained.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Specific
    issues affecting retroactive child support awards mentioned by Bastarache&nbsp;J.
    at para. 86 of <i>D.B.S. </i>include the status of the child, that is, whether
    the child was still a “child of the marriage” as defined in the <i>Divorce
    Act </i>and whether, at the time of the application, the child was still
    entitled to support. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the case before us, the issues of which parent the children were living with
    at various times and whether a child over age eighteen continued to be a
    child of the marriage because the child was attending school were canvassed
    by the trial judge.  The appellant has not convinced me that she committed
    any error that would meet the standard of review for overturning an award
    of support.  See <i>D.B.S.</i> at para 136. . </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other
    factors in determining whether a court should exercise its discretion to
    order retroactive child support articulated by Bastarache J. include 1) whether
    the child would get no discernible benefit from the award or the award would
    cause hardship to a payor parent (at para. 95); 2) a reasonable excuse for
    why support was not sought earlier (at paras. 100-104); 3) blameworthy conduct
    of the payor parent, that is, conduct that privileges the payor parent’s
    own interests over his/her children’s right to an appropriate amount of support
    (at paras. 105-109); 4) whether the payor parent has indirectly met his/her
    support obligation; the present circumstances of the child and whether, in
    the past, the child suffered hardship because the proper amount of support
    was not paid (at paras. 110-113). The Supreme Court also stressed at para.
    99 that a holistic approach should be used and that support in each case
    is dependent on the particular factual matrix. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that because the court did not impose a trust on the amount
    of retroactive support in favour of the children, they will not benefit from
    the award but that it represents, instead, a transfer of wealth to the respondent.  The
    appellant has not discharged the onus of proof regarding this allegation.  The
    fact that the respondent will indirectly benefit is not a reason to refuse
    to make the award of support.  I would also reject the appellant’s request
    to impose a trust over these funds.  This court has held in <i>Simon v. Simon</i> (1999),
    1 R.F.L. (5<span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New Roman"'>th</span>) 119 at para.
    38, that absent a good reason to do so, a court should not interfere with
    the way in which the parent balances the present and future needs of the
    child in his or her custody.  Here, the strong evidence required to establish
    the need for a trust is not present.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the respondent has no reasonable excuse for not making
    an application for support at an earlier date.  The respondent submits the
    appellant’s deception concerning his income made the interim amount he agreed
    to pay in 1997 seem reasonable.  After the forensic efforts by the respondent
    indicated he was grossly under-representing his income, the claim for retroactive
    support was made.  I would accept the respondent’s submission. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    found by the trial judge, the appellant engaged in a lengthy period where
    he deliberately concealed his income.  As Bastarache J. stated in <i>D.B.S. </i>at
    para. 106:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Courts should not hesitate to take into account
    a payor parent’s blameworthy conduct in considering the propriety of a retroactive
    award.  Further, I believe courts should take an expansive view of what constitutes
    blameworthy conduct in this context.  I would characterize as blameworthy
    conduct anything that privileges the payor parent’s own interests over his/her
    children’s right to an appropriate amount of support.  A similar approach
    was taken by the Ontario Court of Appeal in <i>Horner v. Horner </i>(2004),
    72 O.R. (3d) 561 at para. 85, where children’s broad “interests” –rather
    than their “right to an appropriate amount of support” –were said to require
    precedence; however, I have used the latter wording to keep the focus specifically
    on parents’ support obligations.  Thus, a payor parent cannot hide his/her
    income increases from the recipient parent in the hopes of avoiding larger
    child support payments: [citations omitted]…. And a payor parent cannot mislead
    a recipient parent into believing that his/her child support obligations
    are being met when (s)he knows that they are not. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also submits that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence in
    finding that the respondent depleted her capital.  He submits that at most
    the respondent depleted her capital to the extent of $250,000; otherwise
    she lost money she gave to her paramour, lost on an investment, and spent
    money on legal and forensic accounting fees that were not connected to supporting
    the children.  As a result the appellant submits that the award of $950,000
    was not justified.  At the time of her decision, the trial judge did not
    have the benefit of the Supreme Court’s reasons in D.B.S. wherein Bastarache
    J. held at para. 113 that “… hardship suffered by other family members (like
    recipient parents forced to make additional sacrifices) are irrelevant in
    determining whether retroactive support should be owed to the child.”  Thus,
    whether the trial judge was correct or not in finding that the respondent
    depleted her capital is irrelevant.  The trial judge was correct in holding
    that the circumstances justified a retroactive award of support.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the evidence does not indicate that the appellant has indirectly discharged
    his support obligations by making an equivalent payment in kind to the children.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the amount of retroactive support ordered after the introduction
    of the guidelines, Bastarche J. held in <i>D.B.S.</i> at para. 126 that after
    the coming into force of the <i>Guidelines</i>,
    “the <i>Guidelines </i>must be followed in determining the quantum of support
    owed” subject, of course, to the court’s discretion to depart from the <i>Guidelines </i>in
    cases where the amount earned by the payor spouse exceeds $150,000 a year
    and the payor spouse has discharged the onus of establishing that the guideline
    amount is inappropriate.  The amount of retroactive support the trial judge
    awarded for the period following the coming into force of the Guidelines
    is less than a strict application of the <i>Guidelines. </i> The appellant
    has not shown any error in principle in the manner in which the trial judge
    exercised her discretion. <i> </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    determining the amount of retroactive support that pre-dated the Guidelines,
    the trial judge was not required to follow a strict needs-based approach
    for that period.  As Bastarache J. stated at para. 47 of his reasons, the <i>Guidelines </i>do
    not represent “a complete departure from the principles of child support
    that existed in the past”; they build on a premise that already existed.  That
    premise included the right of the children to be supported in accordance
    with their parents standard of living had they not separated.  The appellant
    has not satisfied me that the trial judge imposed a retroactive support payment
    that regarded the needs of the children as completely irrelevant in ordering

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that it was reasonable to assume that the husband’s income,
    which she found to be $5.5-million a year, had not deteriorated and was more
    than sufficient to support the wife’s claim for $23,000 a month in child
    support for the remaining child under her care.  This amount was intended
    to be inclusive of s. 7 expenses and was substantially less than the amount
    under a strict application of the pre–May 2006 <i>Guidelines </i>which presume
    a payment of $36,952 for one child. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Hickey
      v. Hickey</i>,<i> </i>[1999] 2 S.C.R. 518, the Supreme Court of Canada
      reaffirmed the high deference owed by appellate courts to a trial judge’s
      award for child support and held that the award should not be overturned
      absent an error in principle, a misapprehension of the evidence or unless
      the award was clearly wrong.  The appellant submits that the amount awarded
      by the trial judge for support is “clearly wrong” because it is simply
      too high for one child. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Simon
      v. Simon</i>, <i>supra</i>, this court held that the mother was not required
      to justify the Table amount of support under s. 4 of the Guidelines.  Rather
      the onus was on the appellant to establish that the amount of support ordered
      by the trial judge was excessive and in that case he had not done so.  As
      a result, the court allowed an award of $9,200 a month for a five-year-old
      boy.  In <i>Francis v. Baker </i>(1998), 34 R.F.L. (4<span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New Roman"'>th</span>)
      317 (Ont. C.A.), Abella J.A. held that a court should not reduce the Table
      amount of child support simply because it involves the transfer of some
      wealth from the payor to the payee.  On the further appeal to the Supreme
      Court of Canada the sheer size argument was dismissed and Bastarache&nbsp;J.
      for the court agreed with both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal
      on this point.  See: [1999] 3 S.C.R. 250 at para. 52.  Basic needs of the
      child are not the sole or even dominant support in cases involving very
      wealthy payor spouses: <i>Tauber v. Tauber </i>(2000), 6 R.F.L. (5<span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New Roman"'>th</span>)
      442 (Ont. C.A.).  Here the amount awarded by the trial judge is significantly
      below the guideline amount.  I would not interfere with the reasonable
      exercise of the trial judge’s discretion.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge awarded the respondent $2,250,000 in costs.  The appellant’s
    offers were all significantly less than the trial judgment.  The appellant
    withdrew all offers minutes before the trial started.  In coming to her award
    of costs the trial judge took into account the lack of specificity in the
    accounts of the respondent’s previous solicitor, Mr.&nbsp;Zaldin and, in
    coming to her ultimate award, reduced his costs. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his factum, the appellant submits that the costs award includes costs by
    Mr.&nbsp;Zaldin for issues that were not part of this proceeding in that
    they related to the issue of what the date of marriage should be.  However,
    the trial judge specifically held at para. 38 of her reasons on costs that
    such prior proceedings could not form part of the costs fixed by her. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also submits that some of the fees awarded on interlocutory matters
    were “topped up” from a partial indemnity scale to a substantial indemnity
    scale and that the trial judge was not entitled to do this.  The trial judge’s
    rationale for
    “topping up” interlocutory orders where costs were fixed on a partial indemnity
    scale was that the respondent was entitled to be reimbursed on a substantial
    indemnity scale throughout.  In coming to her conclusion the trial judge
    relied on the decision of Blair J. in <i>131843 Canada Inc. v. Double “R” (Toronto)
    Ltd.</i> (1992), 11 C.P.C. (3d) 190 (Ont. Ct. J. (Gen.Div.)) in which he
    commented at para. 25 that topping up the award “was simply a question of
    providing to the successful party the full indemnity that such an award envisions.”  I
    would agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Subject

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that this was an appropriate case in which to award
    a premium to reflect the exceptional skill of the respondent’s solicitors,
    the result achieved at trial, the enormous difficulties caused by the appellant’s
    bad-faith litigation, and the financial risk if the proceedings failed.  She
    concluded that a premium of $150,000 was warranted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the trial judge’s award of a premium and the argument of this appeal, the
    Supreme Court of Canada released its decision in <i>Walker v. Ritchie</i>,<i> </i>2006
    SCC 45, on October 13, 2006, in which it held that unsuccessful defendants
    did not have to pay the premium charged by counsel for a successful plaintiff.  The
    rationale for the court’s decision was that unsuccessful defendants should
    expect to pay similar amounts by way of costs across similar pieces of litigation.  Since
    a defendant has no knowledge of the fee arrangement made by the plaintiff,
    the defendant would have no means of measuring the risk of engaging in litigation
    insofar as costs were concerned.  The Court also held that the application
    of Rule 49 and the award of substantial indemnity costs, did not warrant
    a difference in approach.  Finally, the opportunity for counsel to charge
    his or her own client a risk premium, or (as the law now allows) a contingency
    fee, encourages competent counsel to take on the cases of impecunious persons
    and disallowing a premium would not impede access to justice.  See paras.
    24, 28, 30, and 40.  Accordingly, I would allow the appeal with respect to
    the premium imposed and set it aside.</p>

      cross-appeal advanced here as well as an argument by the respondent to
      the cross-appeal.  She stated at paras. 50-52 and 57: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is submitted by the wife that the highest interest
    rate allowable under the law should be awarded to discourage “bad faith” conduct.  In
    this case, the fluctuation in interest rates has a significant impact (approximately
    a $2.3 million difference).  In my view, it is appropriate in the exercise
    of my discretion to award an average of the rates which more accurately reflects
    the true prevailing rate over the entire period.  The purpose of prejudgment
    interest is to compensate for the loss of use of money and ought not to be
    used as a reward or a punishment.  (<i>Armak Chemicals Ltd. v.</i> <i>Canadian
    National Railway </i>(1991), 5 O.R. (3d) 1, [(<i>sub nom. Oakville Storage &amp; Forwarders

    C.A.).  In any event, the award of costs already addresses the husband’s
    misconduct.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is submitted that the prejudgment interest rate
    on the funds removed by the husband from the TD Greenline accounts in the
    wife’s name should be reduced to .4% per annum from the date the funds were
    paid into court pursuant to court order.  This is the net interest rate that
    the funds yielded after the court deducted its management fees.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I do not agree.  The wife was awarded the return
    of these funds under the judgment.  It was open to the husband to return
    the funds to her, pending trial.  In all the circumstances, an average interest
    rate is fair.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>[. . .]</p>

    to make a profit on the capital at issue in this appeal at her expense and
    thereby erred.  She submits that the respondent by cross-appeal should be
    required to disgorge this profit and seeks interest at the rate of 10&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent
    per annum.  Alternatively Mrs. Debora seeks interest at 6 per&nbsp;cent from
    the date the proceedings began in March 1996 or at 8&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent from

    jurisdiction to award pre-judgment interest is conferred by ss. 128 and 130

    J.A. in <i>Stellarbridge Management Inc. v. Magna International (Canada)

    had already addressed the husband’s misconduct and she declined to use prejudgment
    interest to punish him further. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    wording of s. 130 is very broad and, in addition to enabling the trial judge
    to consider the circumstances of the case, specifically allows the trial
    judge to take into account Mr. DeBora’s conduct in lengthening unnecessarily
    the duration of the proceeding by his persistent refusal to make full disclosure
    of his income and assets.  As Cronk J.A. noted in <i>Somers v. Fournier</i> (2002),
    60 O.R. (3d) 225 at para. 25 (C.A.), <i>Armak</i> concerns an older version
    of the prejudgment interest provision, and s. 130(2)(f) grants the trial
    judge the jurisdiction to consider a litigant’s conduct during the proceedings
    when determining whether to exercise her discretion to vary the rate of prejudgment
    interest.  While the trial judge may have erred in her reliance on <i>Armak</i>,
    this error does not change the outcome on this issue.  In addition to her
    reliance on <i>Armak</i>, the trial judge was of the opinion that she had
    already punished Mr. Debora’s conduct by her award of costs.  The amount
    of prejudgment interest awarded by the trial judge took into consideration
    the fluctuations in the applicable rate of interest during this lengthy litigation
    and is rationally connected to the interest rates that prevailed over the
    relevant period.  The cross-appellant has failed to demonstrate that, aside
    from her reliance on <i>Armak, </i>the trial judge proceeded on an erroneous
    principle of law.  Since the award of prejudgment interest is a matter of
    discretion for the trial judge, I see no basis for appellate intervention. </p>
