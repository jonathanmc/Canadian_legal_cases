    after midnight on June 20, 2003, two masked men entered a convenience store
    in Sault Ste. Marie and robbed the clerk of a small amount of cash, some
    cigarettes and some soft drinks.  One of the men, Adrian Smith, was armed
    with a loaded sawed-off shotgun.  By chance, Smith and another man, Andre
    Laine, were arrested a few hours after the robbery on another matter.  Smith
    came to believe that Laine had informed on him to the police and accordingly,
    he told the police of his and Laine’s role in the robbery.  He also implicated
    the appellant in the robbery as the get-away driver.  A short time later,
    the police arrested the appellant and, after obtaining a search warrant,
    found the shotgun and some of the stolen goods in the appellant’s bedroom.  </p>

    the joint trial of the appellant and Laine, Smith recanted any part of his
    statement to the police implicating them in the robbery.  The trial judge
    admitted the statement as an exception to the hearsay rule.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant attempted to meet the Crown’s case by adducing evidence of an alibi
    and through his own testimony in which he denied participating in the robbery.  He
    claimed that Smith had left the gun in his room without his knowledge when
    he was briefly out of the room.</p>

    trial judge, Whalen J., considered Smith to be a highly suspect witness and
    since there was no independent evidence confirming Smith’s story as it implicated
    Laine, he acquitted him.  However, he found ample corroboration as regards
    the appellant because the appellant was in possession of the gun and the
    stolen goods only a short time after the robbery.  He rejected the appellant’s
    alibi and convicted him.</p>

    the following reasons, I would dismiss the appeal from conviction and sentence.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>THE ALIBI</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the Friday before the trial was to begin, counsel for the appellant (not
    Mr.&nbsp;Wilkinson) provided a letter to Crown counsel stating that his client
    relied upon an alibi.  The particulars given in the letter were that the
    appellant was with Ricky Hodgkins on June 20, 2003 until 12:30 a.m.  At trial,
    Hodgkins testified that the appellant was with him on two occasions on June
    19, that they met up the second time between 9:00 and 10:00 p.m. and that
    they were together for the next one to two hours.  He was able to remember
    the day he was with the appellant because he found out that the appellant
    was arrested the following day and because the appellant had been talking
    about his sister’s graduation. However, it is fair to say that Hodgkins’ memory
    was otherwise not good.  He could provide virtually no details of what he
    did with the appellant during these times.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified that from 4:00 to 9:00 p.m. on June 19, he was with members
    of his family at his sister’s high school graduation.  No other members of
    his family testified at the trial.  However, the appellant identified a photograph
    showing him at the graduation and his sister’s diploma, with the June 19
    date, was entered into evidence.  The 4:00 to 9:00 p.m. interval was important
    because in his statement Smith had said that some of the preparation and
    planning for the robbery involving the appellant took place then.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in his treatment of his alibi
    in several respects.  First, he submits that the trial judge erred in stating
    that the law requires an accused to give to the Crown “the earliest possible
    notice” of an alibi.  As held in <i>R. v. Cleghorn</i> (1995), 100 C.C.C.
    (3d) 393 (S.C.C.) at 397, the correct statement of the principle is that
    the disclosure of the alibi is proper “when it allows the prosecution and
    police to investigate the alibi evidence before trial”.  The timeliness and
    adequacy are evaluated
    “on the basis of whether a meaningful investigation could have been undertaken
    as a result of disclosure”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    this error by the trial judge was of no consequence.  The trial judge drew
    an adverse inference against the alibi, not because it was not disclosed
    at the earliest possible time, but because it was not disclosed in time to
    allow for meaningful investigation.  In his reasons, the trial judge explained
    how the police investigation was hampered by this late disclosure.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his very helpful submissions, Mr. Wilkinson attempted to rebut the argument
    that the investigation was hampered.  First, he argued that, as a matter
    of fact, the police were able to investigate the alibi because they took
    a statement from Hodgkins before he testified.  However, by the time the
    police were able to speak to Hodgkins, some eight months after the robbery,
    Hodgkins had almost no memory of the events.  He could provide no details
    that could be independently verified.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    Mr. Wilkinson argued that the Crown is precluded from relying on the adverse
    inference resulting from late disclosure of an alibi because they did not
    seek an adjournment to conduct an investigation.  I need not decide whether
    such a proposition could ever be an answer to the Crown’s claim of an adverse
    inference arising from late disclosure since it has no application in this
    case.  The police did what investigation they could based on the notice provided
    to the Crown.  Delaying the trial would not have assisted because, by the
    time he was interviewed, Hodgkins had little information to provide.  The
    police did not need more time, they needed to have notice of the alibi at
    a time when they could have made a meaningful inquiry.  That opportunity
    was lost because of the late disclosure.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    Mr. Wilkinson argued that the Crown called no evidence that it was prejudiced
    by the late disclosure and was therefore precluded from relying on the resulting
    adverse inference.  It may be that in some cases such evidence could be adduced,
    but the evidence was not necessary here.  The prejudice is obvious on the
    record from the nature of Hodgkins’ evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also submits that the trial judge erred in his approach to the
    alibi in other respects.  He submits that the trial judge erred in dealing
    with that part of the alibi concerning the graduation ceremony.  In his reasons,
    the trial judge stated that he had some scepticism about whether the certificate
    proved the date of the graduation and “would have been more comfortable if
    someone had indicated it specifically and independently in a situation as
    serious as this.  In any event, even accepting that he did go to the graduation
    exercises that day, there is no corroboration of the time of day or for how
    long he was there.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that it was an error to place a burden on the appellant
    to introduce corroboration of the alibi.  While the term “corroboration” could
    have been avoided in this context, in my view, the trial judge did not make
    a reversible error.  He was merely making the observation that the graduation
    certificate did not establish the time when the appellant was at the ceremony.  While
    the trial judge accepted the certificate and the photograph as independent
    evidence confirming the appellant’s attendance at the ceremony, there was
    no independent evidence confirming when the appellant was there.  I do not
    read the reasons as reversing the burden of proof or as suggesting that the
    trial judge was unaware that the appellant had to be acquitted if there was
    a reasonable doubt arising from the alibi evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the same must be said of the other passages in the reasons about
    which the appellant complains.  For example, the appellant submits that the
    trial judge erred when he said that he was not “convinced” by Hodgkins and
    did not find him a helpful or
    “convincing” witness.  Again, these statements do not indicate any reversal
    of the burden of proof.  For the cogent reasons that he provided, the trial
    judge did not believe Hodgkins was with the appellant at the critical times.  It
    was simply in that sense that the trial judge used the above phrases.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in failing to consider the
    alibi evidence in the context of the evidence as a whole, and especially
    in conjunction with the appellant’s own testimony.  I do not accept this
    submission.  The trial judge reviewed all the evidence, especially the appellant’s
    evidence, and he explained in great detail why he did not find the appellant
    credible.  I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>SMITH’S LACK OF MOTIVE TO FALSELY IMPLICATE
    THE APPELLANT</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred by improperly using Smith’s
    apparent lack of motive for falsely implicating him in the robbery in his
    assessment of the appellant’s credibility.  This ground of appeal arises
    out of a portion of the reasons where the trial judge provided several grounds
    for rejecting the appellant’s explanation for the presence of the gun in
    his bedroom.  He said the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>First of all,
    I don’t see any reason for Mr. Smith to implicate Mr. Mearow if he wasn’t
    in fact involved.  He had no reason to be angry with Mr. Mearow or to seek
    revenge against him.  It wasn’t necessary to implicate him just to get Mr.
    Laine.  Nor was it necessary to tell police where the gun was.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>The trial
    judge then went on to give other reasons for rejecting the appellant’s evidence.  The
    record supports those reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that it was an error to place the burden on him to provide
    some reason for Smith to falsely implicate him in the robbery.  But this
    part of the reasons has to be considered in the context of the issues presented
    at the trial.  In cross-examination of Smith and in argument, counsel for
    the appellant attempted to establish that, at the time he was giving his
    statement to the police, Smith did have a motive for falsely implicating
    the appellant.  The attempt failed.  In my view, in the impugned part of
    the reasons the trial judge merely dealt with one of the issues raised by
    the appellant at trial.  He was not placing any burden on the appellant to
    explain Smith’s testimony, nor did he use the perceived absence of motive
    to strengthen Smith’s credibility.  As this court said in <i>R. v. Batte</i> (2000),
    145 C.C.C. (3d) 449 at para. 120, “the absence of any reason to make a false
    allegation is a factor which juries, using their common sense, will and should
    consider in assessing a witness’ credibility”.  In my view, that is all that
    the trial judge was doing here.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not give effect to this ground of appeal.  Accordingly, I would dismiss
    the appeal from conviction.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>THE SENTENCE APPEAL</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    principal challenge to the sentence is the disparity between the six-year
    sentence imposed on the appellant and the four-year sentence imposed on Smith.  In
    my view, the trial judge did not err in principle in imposing the appellant’s
    sentence.  The actual disparity is only 18 months because six months of the
    appellant’s sentence is attributable to an offence of possession of a prohibited
    weapon unrelated to the robbery.  Further, Smith’s sentence has to be viewed
    in context.  He pleaded guilty and offered substantial assistance to the
    police in the investigation of the offence.  He was entitled to a significant
    reduction in the sentence that would ordinarily be imposed because of these
    mitigating factors.  Further, the four-year sentence was actually part of
    a total five-and-a-half-year sentence imposed on Smith for the robbery and
    other unrelated offences.  In considering the disparity issue it is important
    to bear in mind other principles of sentencing, such as totality, that would
    have impacted any sentence imposed on Smith.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the sentence imposed on the appellant was appropriate.  Although
    he was only 19 years old, the appellant had 47 prior convictions including
    convictions for assault, uttering threats, assault with a weapon, and assault
    causing bodily harm.  When he committed this robbery, the appellant had been
    out of custody for some two days.  This was a very serious offence involving
    the use of a loaded sawed-off shotgun to rob a vulnerable victim. The appellant
    helped plan the robbery, participated in stealing the car used in the robbery,
    and assisted in obtaining the gun and ammunition. Even if the appellant was
    merely the getaway driver, his culpability in this offence was significant.  The
    trial judge was in a particularly advantageous position in determining the
    appropriate sentence.  He had presided at the trial, heard Smith and the
    appellant testify, and viewed the videotapes of Smith’s statement and surveillance
    camera footage showing the commission of the robbery.</p>
