  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment
      of Justice C. Raymond Harris of the Superior Court of Justice dated November
      24, 2004.</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    VanRavenswaay’s corporation purchased the shares of two of Mr. Kummer’s companies.  The
    Kummer companies were in the trucking business.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    lawsuit arose concerning (a) the amount owing on the remaining balance of
    a promissory note given on closing, (b) the liability for an accounting debt
    of one of the purchased companies, and (c) liability in relation to land
    contamination arising from a 300 gallon bottomless waste oil tank that was
    later discovered submerged on the property.   Justice Harris found that a
    sum of $31,000 paid to Mr. Kummer was a payment on account of the outstanding
    promissory note and not a payment with respect to a side-deal consulting
    agreement; that the cost of the accounting fees should be split between Mr.
    VanRavenswaay and Mr. Kummer equally, in the amount of $5,885 each; and that
    Mr. Kummer was liable to the purchasers for damages in the amount of $35,000
    for remediation costs necessary to clean up the contamination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the conclusion of argument, we indicated to counsel that the appeal would
    be allowed with respect to the accounting fees, but that it would otherwise
    be dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s finding that the payments of $31,000 were on account of the
    outstanding purchase price, secured by the promissory note, as opposed to
    payments to Mr. Kummer for his consulting arrangement, was supported by the
    evidence and there is no basis for interfering with it.  Mr. Higginson in
    effect conceded this at the outset of his argument.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    can we find any basis for interfering with the trial judge’s finding that
    the defendant misrepresented the existence of the submerged waste oil tank
    and that the Plaintiff was misled in respect of a material contractual matter.  The
    remedy of damages for remediation followed, and there is no issue as to the
    amount claimed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    we are not able to understand the legal basis upon which the trial judge
    ordered the defendants to pay one-half of the accounting fees incurred by
    the purchased corporation in relation to the accounting services necessary
    for the deemed year end following the share purchase.  Mr. Valente concedes
    there was no contractual basis for such a claim and even Mr. VanRavenswaay’s
    own accountants advised that they could think of no statutory or legal basis
    for it.  While sharing the fees may have been a fair way for the parties
    to absorb such fees – arising as they did from the transaction – there was
    no such agreement between the parties, and the fees remain the obligation
    of the purchased corporation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we allow the appeal in this latter respect.  The judgment of Harris J. is
    varied by deleting paragraph 2(b) thereof.  In all other respects, the appeal
    is dismissed.  As the respondents were substantially successful on the appeal,
    they are entitled to their costs of the appeal, which we fix in the amount
    of $9,000 all inclusive.</p>
