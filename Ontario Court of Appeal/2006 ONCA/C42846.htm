  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Brian
    Cowderoy appeals from the decision of the trial judge admitting a copy of
    the will of his mother, Victoria Cowderoy, executed in 1997 for probate (the
    Will).  Kostas Sorkos is the beneficiary under the Will, and was the testator’s
    common law husband of forty years up until the time of her death in 2001.  If
    the Will fails, Brian Cowderoy stands as the sole beneficiary under another
    will executed by the testator in 1984. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, Mr. Sorkos admitted that the Will he had presented to the court for
    probate was a
    “cut and paste” photocopy that he had prepared.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a>  Mr.
    Sorkos testified that the Will had been properly executed, but lost.  No
    signed copy of the Will was ever found.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Cowderoy denied that his mother executed the Will; alternatively, he claimed
    that she lacked the testamentary capacity to execute it.  In the further
    alternative, he argued that the Will was procured by undue influence; or,
    that the Will had been revoked. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    hearing over five days of oral evidence, including the evidence of both of
    the witnesses to the execution of the Will, the trial judge admitted an unsigned
    copy of the Will for probate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal Mr. Cowderoy limited his grounds of appeal to two issues: (i) the
    trial judge did not apply the correct legal test for probating a lost will,
    and (ii) the trial judge did not consider the doctrine of suspicious circumstances.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Sorkos submits that the trial judge applied the correct legal test, and argues
    that in this case there is no factual basis to support the application of
    the doctrine of suspicious circumstances.  He says that, while Mr. Cowderoy
    characterizes his grounds of appeal as “errors in law”, it is really an attempt
    to overturn findings of fact firmly grounded in the evidentiary record. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have decided the issues in the order that they were presented to this court
    by Mr. Cowderoy, namely, the trial judge’s application of the test for proving
    a lost will, and suspicious circumstances.  After considering both issues,
    I conclude that there is no basis upon which to interfere with the findings
    and holdings of the trial judge, and I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(i)        Proving a lost will:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    test for proving a lost will requires that Mr. Sorkos demonstrate:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>due
    execution of the Will; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>particulars
    tracing possession of the Will to the date of death, and afterwards if the
    Will was lost after death; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>rebuttal
    of the presumption that the Will was destroyed by the testator with the intention
    of revoking it; and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>proof
    of the contents of the lost Will.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence clearly established the due execution of the Will, which the trial
    judge held to be identical to the one presented at trial.  While Mr. Cowderoy
    points to inconsistencies in the evidence, it nevertheless remains uncontradicted
    that the testator executed the Will in the presence of two independent witnesses. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assuming
    that the presumption of revocation, as outlined below, applies in this case,
    Mr. Sorkos – on a balance of probabilities – would have been required to
    rebut the presumption that, because the executed copy of the Will was lost,
    the testator intended to revoke the Will.  This burden flows from the principle
    that: when a will is traced to the possession of the testator and cannot
    be found at the date of death, there is a presumption that it was destroyed
    by the testator with the intention of revoking it: <i>Lefebvre v. Major</i> [1930]
    S.C.R. 252 at 257. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    two reasons it is doubtful that the presumption of revocation applies in
    this case.  First, the trial judge found that the testator had -- apparently
    because of the progression of Parkinson’s disease -- likely lost her capacity
    to revoke the Will <span
style='color:black'>by 1998</span>, the date at which the Will went missing.  Second,
    the testator entrusted Sorkos with the Will and assumed Sorkos had kept the
    Will for safekeeping.  Consequently, the presumption of revocation would
    not apply since the originally executed Will was not in the testator’s possession
    at the time it went missing. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>Once
      again, assuming the presumption of revocation does apply, it was considered
      and rejected by the trial judge, and the evidence in this regard supported
      his findings and conclusion.  It is true that the trial judge did incorrectly
      state that Mr. Sorkos’ briefcase containing the Will was missing when in
      fact the evidence was that only the envelope containing the Will went missing.  It
      appears to me that the trial judge merely misstated this evidence, which
      in my view is of no significance to his ultimate decision.  I would not
      disturb his decision.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is correct, as counsel for Mr. Cowderoy points out, that in Ontario it appears
    that Mr. Sorkos must prove that the contents of the will reflect the testamentary
    intentions of the testator beyond a reasonable doubt: <i>Re Craig</i>, [1939]
    O.R. 175 (C.A.) at 179.  However, other jurisdictions have held that the
    standard of proof required for the reconstruction of a lost will is that
    of reasonable probability: <i>Re Wippermann</i>, [1953] 1 All E.R. 764 at
    766; <i>Squires Estate v. Squires</i>, (1979), 24 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 288
    (Nfld. D.C.).  It may be that the time has come for Ontario to reconsider
    this issue, however, I do not think that this is the appropriate case in
    which to do so.  The evidence in this case overwhelmingly satisfies the standard
    of proof required in Ontario to prove the contents of the Will.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    independent witnesses at trial identified a copy of the Will, which was executed
    by the testator in <span style='color:black'>November</span> 1997, and witnessed
    by them.  This was the same Will provided to the testator by her lawyer in
    March 1997.  Some of the evidence that supports that of the two witnesses
    includes:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    January 1997, the testator’s solicitor attended at her residence to discuss
    the preparation of her will.  She was thereafter to advise her solicitor
    as to whom she wanted to act as her executor and trustee.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Her
    solicitor followed up on two occasions following his visit, and the testator
    indicated she had given no further consideration to her will.  It was suggested
    that she speak to her son, about the will.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    some point prior to March 3, 1997, the testator provided instructions regarding
    the will and pursuant to those instructions a draft will was prepared and
    sent to her for execution.  She provided a copy of the draft will to her
    son later in March 1997 and he read and explained the terms of the draft
    will to her.  He also advised her that his son had been left out in the clause
    providing for his other three children. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Prior
    to October 28, 1997, her lawyer was advised that the draft will should be
    revised to reflect the fact that a portion of the estate was to be left to
    the benefit of all four of her grandchildren.  The lawyer sent her a revised
    will on October 28, 1997.  It was a copy of this will that was ultimately
    executed on November 14, 1997.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    the evidence was that on the date of execution, the Will was read to the
    testator paragraph by paragraph and the meaning of each explained to her.  The
    testator asked questions, to which answers were provided.  This evidence,
    in my view, leaves no doubt as to the contents of the Will.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>The
      trial judge considered all four branches of the test for propounding a
      lost will, and he made no palpable and overriding errors in his factual
      findings.  I would therefore dismiss this ground of appeal.  </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(ii)      Suspicious circumstances:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once
    it is proven that a will was duly executed, the knowledge and approval of
    the contents of the will and testamentary capacity will be presumed.  However,
    where there is evidence of suspicious circumstances, this presumption is
    vacated and the propounder must then prove that the testator knew and approved
    the contents of the will.  If the suspicious circumstances relate to mental
    capacity, the propounder must also prove testamentary capacity.  The standard
    of proof is not altered by the presence of suspicious circumstances; rather,
    it remains the civil standard of balance of probabilities: <i>Vout v. Hay</i>,
    [1995] 2 S.C.R. 876 at 888-89. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Cowderoy argues that the trial judge failed to consider suspicious circumstances.  In
    his factum he sets out a number of facts, which he says constitute suspicious
    circumstances that call into question the testator’s knowledge, approval,
    or testamentary capacity.  While I acknowledge the existence of these facts,
    I do not agree with his submission that they amount to suspicious circumstances. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Suspicious
    circumstances are those that call into question the preparation of the will,
    the capacity of the testator, and that the free will of the testator was
    overborne by acts of coercion or fraud: <i>Vout v. Hay</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at 888.  Those facts relied upon by Mr. Cowderoy, when considered in context
    with all the other facts as found by the trial judge, do not speak to these
    circumstances. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    though the doctrine of suspicious circumstances does not arise on these facts,
    contrary to the submission of Mr. Cowderoy, the trial judge did not presume
    that the testator knew or approved of the contents of her Will, or that she
    had the mental capacity to execute the Will at the time in question.  Rather,
    the trial judge made factual findings that the testator knew and approved
    of the contents of her Will, and that she had the requisite mental capacity
    to execute it.  There is no basis to interfere with these findings. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence in this case, and the findings by the trial judge, clearly were
    in favour of validating the Will.  Regardless of who had the burden of proof,
    the evidence clearly established the elements required to probate the Will.  I
    reject this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
