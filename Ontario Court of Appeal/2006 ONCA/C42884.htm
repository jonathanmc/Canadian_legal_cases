    &amp; Associates Insurance Brokers appeals the decision of Pepall J. on a
    motion by Allianz Insurance Company of Canada.  The motion judge dismissed
    that part of the motion requesting summary judgment, but granted Allianz
    a stay of Atto’s action and ordered that the undertaking as to damages given
    by Atto, on a motion for an interlocutory injunction, was available to be
    enforced by Allianz.  She directed an inquiry to determine whether Allianz
    sustained any damages and ordered that the parties bear equally the expenses
    of an arbitration proceeding.  Finally she ordered Atto to pay the costs
    of the motion, fixed at $15,000. </span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      is an insurer and Atto was an insurance broker through whom Allianz provided
      its insurance products pursuant to a written agency agreement.  The agreement
      contained a provision that permitted either party to terminate the agreement
      and required that any dispute arising out of or under the agreement be
      subject to arbitration. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When
      Allianz purported to terminate the agency agreement, Atto commenced this
      action to prevent Allianz from terminating the agreement and for damages.  Atto
      immediately brought a motion for an injunction prohibiting Allianz, pending
      a determination as to whether the agreement had been properly terminated,
      from providing the required notice of Allianz’s decision to Atto’s customers
      to terminate the agency agreement as required pursuant to the <i>Insurance
      Act</i> (the “Section 236 Notices”).  As a condition to obtaining injunctive
      relief, Atto, in the affidavit filed by its president, gave its undertaking
      to abide by any court order for damages suffered by Allianz as a result
      of the injunction.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      the consent of the parties, Harvey T. Spiegel J. made an order adjourning
      Atto’s motion to permit the delivery of responding materials and for cross-examinations,
      on terms that no Section 236 Notices would be sent by Allianz during the
      period of the adjournment.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Prior
      to the return of its motion, Atto served a notice of arbitration in respect
      of its dispute with Allianz in accordance with the terms of the agency
      agreement.  On the return of the motion, Molloy J., on consent, further
      adjourned Atto’s motion on terms that the order prohibiting Allianz from
      sending the Section 236 Notices would remain in effect pending the determination
      of the arbitration. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Subsequently,
      an arbitration panel determined that Allianz had properly terminated the
      agency contract.  Atto sought leave to appeal which was denied.  Notwithstanding
      the arbitral decision, Atto advised Allianz that it intended to continue
      its claim for damages in the action.  Allianz then brought the motion under
      appeal. Allianz has claimed that it suffered damages as a result of not
      sending the Section 236 Notices pending the outcome of the arbitration.  During
      that period, it was exposed to numerous claims and had been unable to collect
      premiums owing on the temporary policies. </span></p>

      turn to the issues of whether the undertaking as to damages applies to
      the consent adjournment of the injunction application. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      detailed reasons, the motions judge found that the undertaking as to damages
      was “contained in the affidavits that are typically expressly referenced
      in the order”, that the undertaking was not spent by virtue of a consent
      order and that the orders adjourning the motion granted the injunctive
      relief requested by Atto pending the determination of the matters in dispute
      by arbitration.  Accordingly, the undertaking as to damages was available
      to be enforced.  She directed that an inquiry by held to determine the
      quantum of the damages incurred by Allianz.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Bearing
      in mind that this appeal is not a rehearing and that the decision of the
      motion judge is entitled to deference, Atto has failed to show that the
      motion judge erred in her appreciation of the evidence, in the inferences
      she drew from the evidence, or in her application of the relevant legal
      considerations: see <i>Katsigiannis v. Kottick-Katsigiannis</i> (2001),
      55 O.R. (3d) (C.A.) 456 at 464. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
      agree with the motion judge that based on the exchange of correspondence
      between the parties and the terms of the orders issue by Speigel J. and
      Molloy J., an injunction had issued prohibiting Allianz from delivering
      the same Section 236 Notices contemplated by Atto’s motion for injunctive
      relief.   The undertaking given to the court was not withdrawn for the
      purpose of the consent orders as there can be no doubt that if the undertaking
      had been off the table, Allianz would not have consented to the terms of
      the orders and, more important, the court would not have imposed the terms
      contained in the consent orders. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The costs of the arbitration</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Each
      party appointed an arbitrator and the two arbitrators in turn appointed
      a third member.  The parties did not consult on the costs of the arbitrators.  Atto
    “assumed” that each party would pay the fees charged by its chosen member
    and that the parties would be responsible for payment of the expenses of
    the third arbitrator.  It turned out that the person appointed by Allianz
    charged considerably more that the other two members. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      motion judge ordered that in accordance with the express terms of the arbitration
      provisions contained in the agency agreement, it was “abundantly clear” that
      the costs of the arbitration were to be shared equally by the parties.  Atto
      was required to pay one-half of the costs of the arbitration.  We agree.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      addition, we are of the view that the motion judge had jurisdiction to
      deal with this issue pursuant to s. 6 of the <i>Arbitration Act</i>, S.O.
      1991, c. 17, which provides that a court shall not intervene in matters
      governed by this Act except “to assist in the conducting of arbitrations”.  This
      was a discreet issue that needed to be addressed in order to ensure that
      the arbitration was conducted in accordance with the parties’ arbitration
      agreement.  Apparently the arbitration panel had not been asked to consider
      this issue and we think it was appropriate in the circumstances for the
      motion judge to do so. </span></p>

      our view, the costs order should stand.  The dismissal of that part of
      the motion seeking summary judgment is of no importance.  What is important
      is that Atto’s action was stayed.  In light of the ongoing stay of the
      action and the motion judge’s finding that it was Atto’s questionable conduct
      in insisting upon the continuation of the action that forced Allianz to
      bring its motion, in which it was essentially successful, we are of the
      view that the motion judge properly exercised her discretion in awarding
      costs to Allianz.  </span></p>
