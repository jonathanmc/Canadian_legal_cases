    appellant was tried on an indictment charging him with two counts: aggravated
    assault on Peter McSween and common assault on his brother Gannon McSween.
    Both arose out of events that took place in the early morning of October
    22, 2000. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    in prison on count one and three months in prison on count two, to be served
    concurrently. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals both conviction and sentence on count one. He appeals only
    sentence on count two, since during the trial, he admitted through his counsel
    the facts necessary to support a conviction on this count.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary, the facts are as follows. On October 21, 2000, Peter and Gannon
    McSween spent the evening at a bar with a number of their friends. The appellant
    was also there with a group of his friends. The two groups did not know each
    other.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the bar was closing, Gannon McSween became involved in an altercation with
    one of the appellant’s friends. Security staff intervened and asked everyone
    to leave the bar. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    argument continued outside in the parking lot. Gannon McSween alleged that
    he was punched in the face by the appellant. Peter McSween wrestled with
    one of the appellant’s friends, and when they fell to the ground, several
    others began assaulting him. When the melee broke up, it became evident that
    Peter McSween had been cut on the ear and stabbed in the abdomen. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several
    of Peter McSween’s friends testified that they observed the appellant stabbing
    him while he was on the ground. Two others testified that the appellant had
    a blade like object in his hand. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant and several of his friends, including Justin Khan, were arrested
    a short distance from the Bar. In a statement to the police tendered by the
    Crown at trial, the appellant acknowledged punching Gannon McSween but denied
    stabbing Peter McSween. The appellant did not testify at trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was agreed that the injuries to Peter McSween amounted to wounding and that
    the person responsible for inflicting them was guilty of aggravated assault.
    The only issue at trial was identity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Khan,
    who had been present in the bar, was called by the defence. He denied having
    told several friends that he was responsible for the stabbing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    Khan’s evidence, the defence called three witnesses who testified that he
    had made those admissions to them. All were friends both of the appellant
    and Khan. One said that as he and Khan drove away from the bar that night,
    Khan was asked what happened  and responded “I cut the guy.”  The second
    said that the next night she met a group of friends, including Khan and the
    appellant, and when she asked Khan about the previous night, he said that
    he broke a beer bottle and “juked” a guy. The third witness said that during
    a phone call with Khan the next morning, Khan told him that he
    “nailed” and “juked” some guy  with a beer bottle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge ruled that the out-of-court admissions by Khan lacked sufficient
    guarantees of reliability to be admissible for their truth. The jury was
    instructed to consider them only for the limited purpose of assessing Khan’s
    credibility.</p>
  <h2 style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:13.0pt;
'>THE CONVICTION APPEAL</span></h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raises three issues. He argues that the trial judge erred in instructing
    the jury on the issue of in-court identification and in failing to adequately
    identify inconsistencies among the prosecution witnesses concerning the issue
    of identification. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the appellant’s major argument is that the trial judge erred in refusing
    to permit the substantive use of Khan’s out-of-court admissions. This issue
    arose in a rather unusual way. At the close of the Crown’s case, defence
    counsel advised that Khan could not be located and sought to tender his out-of-court
    admissions through the three witnesses. The trial judge began a <i>voir dire</i>,
    in which these witnesses were called by the defence. The next day, because
    of additional efforts by the police, Khan was located and attended at court.
    The trial resumed with the jury, and the defence called Khan, seeking to
    have him declared adverse pursuant to s. 9(1) of the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i>.
    He was fully examined by the defence  and cross-examined by the Crown. Khan
    denied making the statements attributed to him by the three witnesses and
    denied stabbing Peter McSween. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    next day the trial judge made the ruling that is now challenged. The trial
    then concluded with the defence calling the three witnesses who heard Khan’s
    admissions. They too were fully examined and cross-examined. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his charge, the trial judge instructed the jury that they could not use the
    evidence of these three witnesses of the admissions by Khan to find those
    admissions to be true, but only to assess Khan’s credibility. In his recharge,
    the trial judge underlined this instruction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his ruling on the use to be made of Khan’s out-of-court admissions, the trial
    judge made clear that the sole issue was their reliability. He found that
    the other requirements of s. 9(1) of the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i> were
    met including that the admissions were made. The necessity requirement was
    satisfied because Khan denied making them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    the admissions were not under oath, nor recorded, the trial judge properly
    asked himself if there were other circumstantial guarantees of worthiness
    sufficient to find threshold reliability, thus allowing the jury to consider
    the admissions for their truth. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    clearly stated his conclusion that there were none. In doing so, he referred
    to only two considerations. The first was the availability of the three witnesses
    for cross-examination, a consideration that he found to be insufficient.
    The second was the fact that on his arrest that night, Khan had given a videotaped
    statement to the police that made no mention of the admissions. The trial
    judge found that this supported his ruling.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    three reasons, I agree with the appellant that the trial judge erred in this
    ruling. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    it appears that he failed to consider that the declarant Khan was himself
    available to be cross-examined at trial on these admissions. The importance
    of this factor was underlined by Lamer C.J. in <i>R. v. U.F.J. </i>(1995),
    101 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.) at 116:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            Cross-examination
    alone, therefore, goes a substantial part of the way to ensuring that the
    reliability of a prior inconsistent statement can be adequately assessed
    by the trier of fact.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown argues that cross-examination is of no help here when Khan denies that
    he ever made the statements. I disagree. It is true that because of his complete
    denial Khan has no explanation for changing his story from one version to
    another that could be explored on cross-examination. However, cross-examination
    could certainly address his relationships with the three witnesses testifying
    to his admissions and all of the circumstances in which they say the admissions
    were made. All of this would advance the jury’s ability to assess the ultimate
    reliability of the admissions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the trial judge appears to have given no consideration to his residual discretion
    to relax the strict rule, when it is the defence seeking to tender these
    out-of-court statements for their truth and where that evidence has some
    reliability. As Rosenberg J.A. said in <i>R. v. Folland </i>(1999), 132 C.C.C.
    (3d) 14 (Ont. C.A.) at 31:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In my view,
    while the trial judge must be satisfied that the prior out-of-court utterances
    have some reliability, the strict standards set, in the context of an application
    by the Crown to make substantive use of prior inconsistent statements incriminating
    the accused, in <i>R. v. B. (K.G.)</i> do not apply.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    in coming to his decision, the trial judge relied on the fact that Khan gave
    a videotaped statement to the police that night that was inconsistent with
    the admissions. However, in determining threshold reliability, it is the
    circumstances of the hearsay statement itself that must be considered, not
    other statements made prior to or subsequent to the one being scrutinized.
    In <i>R. v. Starr</i>, [2000] 147 S.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.) Iacobucci J. put
    it this way at p. 535:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            At
    the stage of hearsay admissibility, the trial judge should not consider the
    declarant’s general reputation for truthfulness, nor any prior or subsequent
    statements, consistent or not. These factors do not concern the circumstances
    of the statement itself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    I conclude that the trial judge erred by improperly applying the considerations
    relevant to the question of threshold reliability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    a proper consideration, I am of the view that the circumstances of the out-of-court
    admissions provide sufficient indicia of reliability to afford the jury a
    satisfactory basis for evaluating their truth. While the admissions were
    not made under oath, nor recorded in any fashion, they were all made spontaneously
    and shortly after the event. They were made to people who were friends of
    the appellant but who were also part of Khan’s circle of friends and with
    whom he presumably felt comfortable. Moreover, there is no evidence of any
    motive for Khan to fabricate. He was clearly linked to the events in question,
    as his arrest that night demonstrates. Most importantly, Khan was available
    at trial to be fully cross-examined on the admissions. Finally, it was the
    defence that sought to tender the admissions for their truth and since Khan’s
    denial of the stabbing was before the jury (with no limit on its use), it
    seems to me only fair that his contrary statements should be available for
    substantive use by the defence, not just for credibility purposes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent suggests that the delay by the three witnesses in reporting these
    admissions casts doubt on their reliability. In my opinion that is not a
    significant factor. The witnesses proffered an explanation for the delay.
    Moreover, the delay goes more to the reliability of their evidence that the
    statements were made, rather than the reliability of the admissions themselves,
    which is the issue here. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent also argues that even if the hearsay ruling was in error, it caused
    little if any prejudice to the appellant, because the admissions were before
    the jury in any case, and they were invited to consider their impact on Khan’s
    credibility. The respondent therefore urges that this is a proper case in
    which to apply the curative proviso in s. 686 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not agree. The jury was clearly and forcefully charged and then recharged
    that they could not use the evidence of Khan’s admissions for their truths.
    Given the circumstances of the offence, I cannot say that had the jury been
    permitted to use the admissions for their truth the result of the trial would
    necessarily have been the same.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary, I conclude that the trial judge erred and that the hearsay evidence
    of Khan’s admissions should have been admitted for its truth. I would therefore
    allow the appeal, set aside the conviction on count 1 and order a new trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is thus unnecessary to deal with the appellant’s alternative arguments on
    the conviction appeal, or with his appeal of sentence for aggravated assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However
    the appellant also appeals his three month sentence for common assault. His
    only argument is not that there was an error in principle, but that the sentence
    was unfit. I disagree. The appellant had two prior convictions, one of which
    was also for assault. At trial, although the sentencing submissions for this
    offence were made after the eighteen month sentence for aggravated assault
    was imposed, the Crown proposed six months in jail and the defence proposed
    one month. In the circumstances, I cannot find the sentence of three months
    to be outside the range. The appeal from sentence for common assault therefore
    must be dismissed.</p>
