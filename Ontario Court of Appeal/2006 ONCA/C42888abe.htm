  <p class=MsoBodyText>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Janet M. Wilson of
    the Superior Court of Justice dated December 10, 2004.</p>
  <h2>APPEAL&nbsp;BOOK ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>      In our view, it was open to the trial
    judge to conclude that it was implicit in the arrangements between the parties
    that all of the attributes of a tenancy at will would not apply to their
    relationship. Further, since it is clear that the relationship between the
    parties ended prematurely, it was open to the trial judge to conduct an
    accounting.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>      In our view however, the trial judge erred
    in carrying out the accounting by affording the respondent double recovery. In
    this respect, the trial judge gave the respondent credit for a five-month
    rent-free period, but, at the same time, required the appellant to provide the
    respondent with what she calculated was full compensation for the renovations
    the respondent carried out. We conclude that to the extent that the respondent
    is entitled to full compensation for its renovations, it should pay reasonable
    rent for the entire period during which it occupied the premises. In all of the
    circumstances, and, in particular, taking account of the fact that the
    respondent suffered some disruption during the early months of its operations
    at the new premises, we would order that the respondent pay its share of
    utilities for the period August through to and including December 2001 plus
    rent at the rate of $1000.00 per month for the same period.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Apart from the issue of costs, the remaining issues raised by the
    appellant address findings of fact made by the trial judge. As the appellant
    has not demonstrated a palpable and overriding error in the trial judge's
    findings of fact, we would not give effect to those grounds of appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>      On the issue of costs, the trial judge
    concluded that until the chattels were returned, recovery in excess of
    $50,000.00 was possible and that the respondent should not therefore be
    deprived of reasonable costs. We see no error in this exercise of the trial
    judge's discretion.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>      Accordingly, the appeal is allowed in
    part, and paragraph one of the judgment is varied so that the amount payable by
    the appellant (the defendant) is reduced by $8,822.57.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>      Even though
    the appellant achieved some success on this appeal, the respondent was largely
    successful in upholding the judgment below. Accordingly, costs of the appeal
    are to the respondent in the amount requested, namely $1750.00 plus
    disbursements and G.S.T.</span></p>
