    appeal raises the issue of the extent to which a defendant in a civil case
    is entitled to attack the basis of his prior criminal conviction founded
    on the same circumstances as those alleged in the civil case.  The appellant
    relies upon the doctrine of abuse of process to argue that the respondent

    appellant, Wendy Hanna appeals the dismissal of her action against her father,
    Harry Charles Abbott Jr. (Mr. Abbott).  The civil action was in relation
    to repeated sexual assaults on the appellant when she was a young girl.  The
    allegations arise from the same events for which Mr. Abbott had previously
    been convicted in 1995. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Abbott did not testify at his criminal trial and no defence witnesses were
    called on his behalf.  <span lang=EN-GB>He was convicted of four counts relating
    to the sexual assaults on the appellant.  Mr. Abbott appealed and filed “fresh
    evidence” with the Court of Appeal.  The appeal was dismissed in 1998.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    civil action came on for trial in 2004, and the convictions against Mr. Abbott
    were filed.  At the outset, the appellant’s counsel took the position that
    liability was not a summary issue and that the convictions were <i>prima
    facie</i> evidence of the underlying facts, which Mr. Abbott could rebut.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the course of the trial, Mr. Abbott elicited evidence from his two sons who
    each testified it was they, and not Mr. Abbott, who had assaulted the appellant.  Mr.
    Abbott had not pleaded the facts underpinning the sons’ testimony and their
    evidence had been part of the “fresh evidence” that had been filed with the
    Court of Appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Abbott was not represented at trial.  The trial judge allowed the testimony
    of the two sons despite the fact that their allegations were not pleaded,
    and ordered the Statement of Defence amended, on his own motion, to conform
    to the testimony.  He found that the conduct of Mr. Abbott did not constitute
    an abuse of process, and he found no negative effect on Mr. Abbott’s position
    arising from the evidence in the Court of Appeal file.  The trial judge then
    found against the appellant.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    this time I propose to set out the background of this case in general terms.  Later
    in these reasons I will refer to specific facts and circumstances that are
    relevant to the issue being considered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Abbott was charged in 1993 with a number of sexual offences involving his
    daughter, the appellant.  The offences were alleged to have commenced in
    1972 to 1973, when she was four to five years of age, and continued until
    1980, when she was twelve.  The appellant disclosed the abuse to her mother
    in 1981 and reported it to the police in 1985.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    reasons that have nothing to do with the appellant, Mr. Abbott was not charged
    with any offences until 1993.  He was then charged with eight sexually-related
    offences in connection with the abuse, including indecent assault, gross
    indecency, incest and having sexual intercourse with a female person not
    his wife and who was under the age of fourteen.  The matter came on for trial
    in 1995, and Mr. Abbott was found guilty in respect of six of the eight counts.  Due
    to the <i>Kienapple </i>principle, a guilty verdict was recorded in respect
    of only four of the counts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Abbott appealed, in part, on the basis of “fresh evidence”, although it seems
    this ground of appeal was not pursued in argument before the Court of Appeal.  The
    fresh evidence appears to have been relied upon only in respect of an allegation
    concerning the competency of counsel.  The appeal was dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fresh evidence included allegations from the appellant’s two brothers, Ken
    and Rick.  It consisted, in part, of a written statement from Rick, prior
    to the criminal trial, to Mr. Abbott’s counsel that he and his brother had “played
    house” with the appellant when they were kids and that there was “penitration
    of the virgina (sic)”.  At the time of the alleged occurrences, Ken would
    have been six to seven and Rick would have been eight to nine years of age. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the appellant was aware that Mr. Abbott had been convicted and had unsuccessfully
    appealed the conviction, she was not aware of the contents of the Court of
    Appeal file, and the documentary evidence filed before the Court of Appeal
    was not produced in the pre-trial proceedings.</p>

    action was commenced by Statement of Claim on<span

  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>Although self-represented at trial, Mr. Abbott was represented by
      counsel throughout most of the interlocutory proceedings.  As noted, h</span>is
      Statement of Defence did not allege any version of events other than the
      fact that he did not perform the sexual assaults as alleged.  Mr. Abbott
      did not deliver an Affidavit of Documents.  He admitted the convictions
      in response to a Request to Admit that was filed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
    discoveries were held.  Because Mr. Abbott had been convicted of the sexual
    assaults and had not pleaded any material facts attacking the conviction,
    the appellant’s trial counsel felt it unnecessary to conduct an examination
    for discovery of Mr. Abbott.  Additionally, given the fact that Mr. Abbott
    was representing himself, it was deemed preferable to forego discoveries
    rather than give him the opportunity to directly examine his daughter in
    person.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    action came on for trial in October and November of 2004.  The appellant
    provided evidence about the assaults themselves and how they affected her.  Her
    mother gave evidence as to the appellant’s apparent emotional state and her
    development since her childhood.  After the appellant closed her case, Mr.
    Abbott, for the first time, alleged that her pre-pubescent brothers had perpetrated
    the sexual abuse suffered by the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Abbott then called his two sons, Ken and Rick, who each testified that they
    had sex with the appellant when she was a child, and which they suggested
    may have accounted for her hymen being torn or broken as discovered in a
    medical examination conducted after the appellant disclosed the abuse in
    1981.  Their evidence, and their statements given during the criminal matter
    and on the appeal, had not been disclosed to the appellant at any prior stage
    of the action.  In addition, Mr. Abbott elicited evidence that it was her
    grandfather, and not himself, who had sexually abused the appellant.  None
    of these assertions had been pleaded.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    Mr. Abbott first attempted to elicit this evidence, the appellant’s trial
    counsel objected, noting among other things that this allegation had not
    been pleaded.  The trial judge ruled that Mr. Abbott was entitled to call
    the evidence and that the pleading would be considered amended in accordance
    with the evidence provided.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the completion of the evidence, during the course of the oral argument, discussion
    between counsel and the trial judge ensued regarding the availability of
    the same evidence prior to the hearing before the Court of Appeal.  The court
    then requested the appellant’s trial counsel to obtain the file of the Court
    of Appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    substantive portion of the Court of Appeal’s file was obtained by the appellant’s
    trial counsel and filed with the court.  When presented with the Court of
    Appeal evidence, the trial judge ruled that it was open to him to retry the
    case in any event.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge commenced his reasons by noting that his decision was “anomalous” given
    that the criminal trial concluded that, beyond a reasonable doubt, Mr. Abbott
    had sexually abused the appellant.  Nonetheless, the trial judge concluded
    he was entitled to disregard the criminal trial findings because he heard
    different evidence.  He relied on the decision of Sharpe J.A. in <i>F.(K.)
    v. White</i> (2001), 53 O.R. (3d) 391 (C.A.) and concluded that the evidence
    contained in the Court of Appeal file did not affect his decision.  He noted
    that neither Rick nor Ken had been previously cross-examined on this evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the end, the trial judge found that the appellant was not a credible witness
    and held that Ken and Rick had had sexual intercourse with the appellant
    and not Mr. Abbott.  For the reasons that follow, I am of the view that the
    appeal must be allowed.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under
    Canadian law, criminal convictions are admissible in subsequent civil proceedings
    and a criminal conviction ordinarily constitutes <i>prima facie</i> - not
    conclusive - proof of the fact of guilt.  However, in some cases the doctrine
    of abuse of process may preclude the person convicted from contesting the
    underlying facts: <i>F.(K.) v. White</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 19.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would note that in this case <i>F.(K.) v. White</i> is the law that was relied
    upon and it appears that there was no reference to, or consideration of,
    the more recent Supreme Court of Canada decision in <i>Toronto (City) v.
    Canadian Union of Public Employees, Local 79</i>, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 77 (“<i>CUPE</i>”).  While
    I believe <i>F.(K.) v. White</i> is generally consistent with the <i>CUPE</i> decision,
    had <i>CUPE</i> been before the court, it is doubtful that this trial would
    have proceeded as it did.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless,
    at the outset of this trial, the appellant’s counsel elected not to move
    for summary judgment and submitted that the trial judge should retry liability.  Counsel
    agreed that it was open to the trial judge to arrive at an opposite conclusion
    than the judge in the criminal trial.  In the result, Mr. Abbott was found
    to have successfully contested the underlying facts of his prior criminal
    convictions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evidence
    was adduced in the trial that the trial judge found successfully rebutted
    the <i>prima facie</i> proof of the facts underlying the convictions.  The
    appellant now asserts that the use of that evidence to challenge the convictions
    was in error as it constituted an abuse of process.  On that basis, Mr. Abbott
    should have been prohibited from contesting the underlying facts of the convictions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Abbott agrees that his criminal convictions are <i>prima facie </i>evidence,
    which in the circumstances of this case might be persuasive<i> </i>evidence
    of the criminal findings; however, he asserts they are not conclusive evidence.  Therefore,
    he says the trial judge in this case was not in error and had to consider
    all the evidence in deciding what weight to give the convictions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, this is a case where the doctrine of abuse of process ought to have
    precluded Mr. Abbott from contesting the underlying facts of his conviction.  As
    I will demonstrate, it was an error for the trial judge to have proceeded
    as he did since it amounted to a relitigation of the criminal trial, which
    in my view brought about a different result and undermined the credibility
    of the judicial process.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    cases such as this one, abuse of process “engages the inherent power of the
    court to prevent the misuse of its procedure in a way that would … bring
    the administration of justice into disrepute”: see <i>Canam Enterprises Inc.
    v. Coles</i> (2000), 51 O.R. (3d) 481 (C.A.) at para. 55, Goudge J.A., dissenting;
    rev’d [2002] 3 S.C.R. 307.  The Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Toronto (City)
    v. Canadian Union of Public Employees, Local 79</i>, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 77 (“<i>CUPE</i>”)
    characterized the doctrine of abuse of process as follows at para. 43:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In all of its applications, the primary focus of
    the doctrine of abuse of process is the integrity of the adjudicative functions
    of the courts.  Whether it serves to disentitle the Crown from proceeding
    because of undue delays …, or whether it prevents a civil party from using
    the courts for an improper purpose … the focus is less on the interests of
    the parties and more on the integrity of judicial decision making as a branch
    of the administration of justice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    doctrine of abuse of process, therefore, concerns itself with the integrity
    of the judicial system and not with the motive or status of the parties.  As
    was observed in <i>CUPE</i>, the reason for that focus is that there is no
    assumption that relitigation will result in a more accurate result.  A similar
    result will, among other things, prove to have been a waste of judicial resources,
    whereas a different result will undermine the credibility of the judicial
    process.  Justice Arbour in <i>CUPE</i>, concluded at para. 52 that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[F]rom the system’s point of view, relitigation
    carries serious detrimental effects and should be avoided unless the circumstances
    dictate that relitigation is in fact necessary to enhance the credibility
    and effectiveness of the adjudicative process as a whole.</p>

    Arbour gives three examples of where relitigation will enhance, rather than
    impeach, the integrity of the judicial system:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>When the first proceeding
    is tainted by fraud or dishonesty;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>When fresh, new evidence,
    previously unavailable conclusively impeaches the original results; or,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>When fairness dictates that
    the original result should not be binding in the new context.</p>

line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    accept that the examples given by Arbour J. may not reflect an exhaustive
    list of situations where relitigation will not amount to an abuse of process.  Indeed,
    I am satisfied that the doctrine of abuse of process ought to generally be
    a flexible doctrine whose aim is to protect litigants from abusive, vexatious
    or frivolous proceedings or otherwise prevent a miscarriage of justice.  Its
    application will depend on the circumstances, facts and context of a given
    case: <i>Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. v. Rhoxalpharma Inc.</i>, [2002]
    F.C.J. No. 1006 (T.D.).</p>

    the same, the <i>CUPE</i> examples provide guidance on the nature, scope
    and context of that which is necessary to allow for relitigation.  Similarly,
    in <i>Civil Liability for Sexual Abuse and Violence in Canada </i>(Toronto:
    Butterworths, 2000), at p. 326, Vella and Grace list examples of the means
    by which a litigant may mitigate or avoid the effect of a prior conviction
    in a civil proceeding.  Justice Sharpe in <i>F.(K.) v. White</i>, at para.
    44, referred with approval to these examples, namely: (i) adducing new evidence
    not available at the criminal trial; (ii) showing that the issues are different;
    and (iii) showing that there was some lack of fairness or effective representation
    in the prior proceedings.</p>

    order to fully understand the error in this case, it will be necessary to
    provide more details on the various parts of the trial where this issue was
    considered.  Unfortunately, as will be seen, this experienced trial judge
    made his decisions in this regard in circumstances that were less than ideal.  The
    appellant’s trial counsel offered only limited assistance to the trial judge
    and Mr. Abbott, in part because he was not a lawyer, provided none.</p>

    is true that through her counsel, the appellant expressly declined to move
    for summary judgment on the issue of liability and evidence was elicited
    at trial that challenged the criminal court findings.  However, it is important
    to note that counsel did so in circumstances that included: (i) Mr. Abbott’s
    admission of the prior convictions; (ii) an absence of any knowledge of the
    Court of Appeal’s consideration of Ken and Rick’s evidence, or indeed what
    that evidence was; and (iii) a Statement of Defence that merely denied liability
    and “put the plaintiff to the strict proof”.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Abbott did provide counsel with a witness list on September 28, 2004, that
    included Ken and Rick; however, there was no indication of what their evidence
    would be.  Moreover, as I note further below, by the time counsel was aware
    he could have moved for summary judgment, the trial judge had made it clear
    that he would not have granted it at that stage of the trial (i.e. after
    the appellant had closed her case). </p>

    the close of the appellant’s evidence on the second day of trial, her counsel
    brought the case of <i>F.(K.) v. White</i> to the attention of the trial
    judge.  The trial judge noted his familiarity with that decision and agreed
    that it stands for the principle that, in certain circumstances, a finding
    of guilt is conclusive in subsequent civil proceedings.  It was at this time
    that the trial judge made it clear to counsel that he would not have granted
    summary judgment at this stage of the trial.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[38]<span

    Mr. Abbott at this time indicated his intention to call his sons, Ken and
    Rick, as witnesses, counsel sought a ruling that their evidence was not admissible.  Counsel
    argued that their evidence was not called in the criminal trial and those
    facts were not pleaded in the civil trial.  Moreover, Mr. Abbott had not
    questioned the appellant in relation to Ken and Rick and what their evidence
    might be during his cross-examination of her.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge held that pursuant to <i>F.(K.) v. White</i>, and because the
    evidence was not called in the criminal trial, he “had to hear it”.   In
    hearing this evidence the trial judge, in my view, engaged in proceedings
    that had the effect of undermining the credibility of the judicial process.  <span style='background:yellow;'> </span>  </p>

    nor was it “new evidence not available at the criminal trial” (see <i>CUPE</i>,
    at para. 52).  On the contrary, their evidence was exactly the same as it
    had been when it was available at the criminal trial and on the appeal.  As
    discussed below, once the trial judge obtained the Court of Appeal file,
    this became even more apparent.</p>

    weight of the prior convictions by: (i) adducing new evidence, not available
    at the conviction; (ii) showing that the issues are different; and (iii)
    showing there was some lack of fairness or effective representation in the

    civil action.  Later I will demonstrate several reasons why this trial was

    appellant was unaware of what that evidence consisted of.  Counsel volunteered

    counsel filed the relevant portions of the Court of Appeal file with the
    trial court.  He noted that the record that had been considered by the Court
    of Appeal contained affidavits from the Crown attorney at the criminal trial
    and Mr. Abbott’s defence counsel.  It also contained transcripts of cross-examinations
    of defence counsel.  </p>

    the time of the appeal.  More significantly, the affidavits revealed that
    each of their allegations was known to defence counsel prior to Mr. Abbott’s
    sentencing; indeed, Rick’s allegations were known to defence counsel and
    Mr. Abbott prior to trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    counsel had not used the allegations of Ken and Rick as an independent ground
    of appeal as “fresh evidence” that might have affected the outcome of the
    trial.  Nevertheless, in his ruling on the weight to be given to the previous
    convictions and any consideration of the Court of Appeal file, the trial
    judge again relied upon <i>F.(K.) v. White</i>, and <span lang=EN-US>concluded,
    at para. 34 of his reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[<i>F.(K.) v. White</i>] makes it clear that a
    defendant has the right to attempt to rebut the weight of a criminal conviction
    with new evidence.  The conviction in the present case is <i>prima facie</i> proof
    of the alleged abuse.  However, there is evidence before me that was not
    adduced at the criminal trial, which, for reasons that follow, rebuts that
    proof.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the evidence of the allegations of Ken and Rick that
    was before the Court of Appeal was not subject to any cross-examination or
    challenge and was considered by the Court of Appeal for a limited purpose.  He
    concluded, at para. 41 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Having had an opportunity to consider the material
    that was before the Court of Appeal and bearing in mind the passage which
    I highlighted from [<i>F.(K.) v. White</i>], I see nothing to preclude me
    from considering the evidence of Ken Abbott and Rick Abbott.  The material
    before the Court of Appeal was filed to support the argument that trial counsel
    had been incompetent and for that purpose only.  There is no indication in
    the Court of Appeal’s reasoning that the evidence of Ken Abbott and Rick
    Abbott was rejected because it did not meet the test for admission of fresh
    evidence established in <i>R. v. Palmer</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, I must disagree with the trial judge.  First, as I have noted repeatedly
    in these reasons, the test to be applied is not whether there is evidence
    that was available and simply not adduced at the criminal trial; rather,
    it is whether or not there is fresh or new evidence that was not available
    at the criminal trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, Mr. Abbott <span lang=EN-US>had a full and fair opportunity to
    litigate the issue at the criminal trial with the very same evidence he adduced
    at the civil trial.  He elected not to do so with the assistance of competent
    counsel, and thus it cannot be said, contrary to what the trial judge found,
    that the civil trial constituted a “completely different approach”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, there is no indication in the Court of Appeal file that the evidence
    was accepted because it met the test for fresh evidence pursuant to <i>Palmer</i>.  The
    full record, including the Court of Appeal file, and the evidence itself
    heard by the trial judge make it abundantly clear that it was not fresh evidence
    pursuant to <i>Palmer</i>.  Once again, Mr. Abbott and his counsel from the
    beginning knew – in various forms – of the existence of this evidence.  It
    was not new or fresh in the <i>Palmer</i> sense, and it was not new or fresh
    in the abuse of process sense, if indeed there is any difference.</p>

    interpreting the authority of <i>F.(K.) v. White</i> in the erroneous fashion
    he did, the trial judge embarked upon a retrial of a matter that had previously
    been fully and fairly decided.  Regrettably, the trial judge wrongly believed
    that because Mr. Abbott chose not to testify at his criminal trial, or call
    the evidence of at least his son Rick, this satisfied the test to rehear
    the matter because it was evidence “not adduced” at the previous trial.  As
    I said, the civil trial was not a completely different approach for purposes
    of establishing whether or not it constitutes an abuse of process.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    at the criminal trial Mr. Abbott, with the assistance of counsel, made the
    tactical decision not to testify or call any evidence in his defence.  Rick’s
    allegations were known to defence counsel and Mr. Abbott prior to the trial.  Mr.
    Abbott’s defence counsel, in the affidavit filed with the Court of Appeal,
    recounts how Mr. Abbott and he together made the tactical decision that Mr.
    Abbott would not testify at his criminal trial.  Further, defence counsel’s
    affidavit notes that the decision was also made not to call Rick as a witness
    because his evidence was “vague” and he “was not a very good witness”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    immediately after Mr. Abbott’s conviction, and prior to his sentencing hearing,
    Ken and Rick gave statements to Mr. Abbott and his lawyer, and to the police
    about their alleged sexual interaction with the appellant.  Indeed, the Crown
    Attorney’s affidavit that was also filed with the Court of Appeal notes how
    the evidence of Ken and Rick was known and fully disclosed to the police,
    Mr. Abbott and his counsel.  The disclosure of this evidence was made before
    sentencing and the appeal.  In fact, the sentencing of Mr. Abbott was adjourned
    to allow a
    “full investigation of the allegations of Ken and Rick” and to give Mr. Abbott
    and his counsel more time to consider it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    three years after the conviction, Mr. Abbott appealed on two grounds: (i)
    an 11(b) <i>Charter</i> issue, and (ii) ineffective assistance of counsel.  Appellate
    counsel were aware of the evidence of Ken and Rick, but did not advance it
    as a discrete ground on appeal.  The first ground was abandoned and the Court
    of Appeal only heard about ineffective counsel.  The appeal was dismissed
    by way of endorsement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    end result is, the circumstances did not dictate that relitigation was necessary
    to enhance the credibility and effectiveness of the adjudicative process
    as a whole.  This trial amounted to an abuse of process because it brought
    about a different result that in all the circumstances undermines the credibility
    of the judicial process.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[56]<span

    the erroneous opinions of both appellant’s trial counsel and the trial judge,
    relitigation of this case should not have occurred.  The trial judge should
    not have considered any of Mr. Abbott’s evidence, including that of his two
    sons, for the issue of liability.  Liability was proven upon Mr. Abbott’s
    agreement that his criminal convictions are <i>prima facie </i>evidence of
    the underlying facts.  The trial judge should have proceeded to hear evidence
    solely for the purpose of deciding the amount of damages to be awarded to
    the appellant.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

    applying the doctrine of abuse of process in <i>CUPE, supra,</i> in order
    to balance the concern of finality in litigation against fairness to a particular
    litigant, Arbour J. cited with approval the following passage from the judgment
    of Doherty J.A. in the Court of Appeal:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>Despite the arbitrator’s insistence that he was not passing on the correctness
    of the decision made by Ferguson J., that is exactly what he did.&nbsp; One
    cannot read the arbitrator’s reasons without coming to the conclusion that
    he was convinced that the criminal proceedings were badly flawed and that
    Oliver was wrongly convicted.&nbsp; This conclusion, reached in proceedings
    to which the prosecution was not even a party, could only undermine the integrity
    of the criminal justice system.&nbsp; The reasonable observer would wonder
    how Oliver could be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in one proceeding
    and after the Court of Appeal had affirmed that finding, be found in a separate
    proceeding not to have committed the very same assault.&nbsp; That reasonable
    observer would also not understand how Oliver could be found to be properly
    convicted of sexually assaulting the complainant and deserving of 15 months
    in jail and yet also be found in a separate proceeding not to have committed
    that sexual assault and to be deserving of reinstatement in a job which would
    place young persons like the complainant under his charge.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

    of the evidence heard by the trial judge on the issue of Mr. Abbott’s liability
    is capable of establishing that Mr. Abbott’s previous criminal trial was
    tainted by fraud or dishonesty.  None of the evidence, as I have shown above,
    establishes that there is any fresh evidence that was not available at the
    criminal trial.  And, none of the evidence dictates that the result in the
    criminal trial was unfair.  The abuse of process doctrine applies to preclude
    re-litigation of the criminal convictions.</p>
