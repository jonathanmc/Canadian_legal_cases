    from the judgment of Justice DiTomaso of the Superior Court of Justice dated
    March 1, 2005.</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%;page-break-after:auto'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal is moot.  At the outset we were advised that Christopher Beauchamp had
    discontinued his appeal.  With respect
    to Mitchell Lebar (the appellant), the dispute underlying the case has disappeared.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, who resided in Aurora, applied for an order
    pursuant to s. 11(1) of the <i>Discriminatory Business Practices Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. D.12, directing the respondents to take steps necessary to
    enable him to play hockey in the Greater Toronto Hockey League.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a>  The appellant wished to play for the Toronto
    Young Nationals during the 2004/2005 season, but did not satisfy the residency
    requirements of the respondents and his request for an exemption had been
    refused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal is from the judgment of DiTomaso J. dated March 1,
    2005 dismissing the application.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsequent to the dismissal of his application, the appellant
    changed his residence from Aurora to Richmond Hill and thereby became eligible
    to play for the Young Nationals.  He
    played for that team for a portion of the 2004/2005 season and for the entire
    2005/2006 season.  Thus, as events
    turned out, the appellant has been able to do what he asked the court to
    order.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant indicates that if this appeal is allowed, he may
    or may not choose to move back to Aurora, raising the possibility that if he
    does move, he may not be eligible to play for the Young Nationals in the
    upcoming season.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the appeal should proceed for two
    reasons.  First, he maintains that it is
    not moot.  He says that the respondents’
    residency requirements constitute a discriminatory business practice under the
    Act and as such place an unacceptable burden on his decision whether to change
    his residence prior to the upcoming hockey season.  However, the appellant has not yet decided whether he wishes to
    change his residence and if he does, he can apply for an exemption from the
    residency requirements and may well be permitted to play in Toronto in any
    event.  It is premature to consider the
    issue of the appellant’s residency decision for next year at this point.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, this argument depends on very different factual
    considerations than those that underlie this appeal.  The facts in our record are premised on the appellant living in
    Aurora and having been refused the permission to play hockey in Toronto.  That is no longer the situation.  The appellant has played hockey in Toronto
    for the past two seasons.  If he now
    decides to move back to Aurora, there will be several facts that would be very
    relevant to a request to play in Toronto that are not in the record before this
    court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the appellant decides that he wishes to change his
    residence back to Aurora and permission to play in Toronto is refused, he could
    bring a new application based on the applicable facts.  We do not accept that the courts cannot deal
    with such an application in a timely manner.  We note that the application in this case was dealt with by the Superior
    Court in three months.  Moreover, if an
    appeal becomes necessary, this court can address an expedited appeal very
    promptly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also argues that this court should hear his
    appeal because it raises the important question whether the respondents’
    residency requirements, in general, contravene the <i>Discriminatory Business
    Practices Act</i>.  We are not prepared
    to address that issue.  That issue has
    not been the focus of this case throughout.  In his application, the appellant did not challenge the whole residency
    requirements scheme, rather his attack was directed at the decision to refuse
    him permission to play hockey in Toronto.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his factum in this court, the appellant put his argument as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Christopher and
    Mitchell [Christopher Beauchamp, who was previously an appellant, and the
    appellant] have not challenged the Respondents’ residency requirements because
    Christopher and Mitchell appreciate that requirements were designed to increase
    the possibility that minor hockey players would have opportunities to play,
    maintain a competitive balance and discourage recruitment.  Christopher and Mitchell have challenged the
    arbitrary nature of the Respondents’ refusal to release them and the
    Respondents’ failure to discharge their legal obligation to consider the effect
    of the Respondents’ refusal on Christopher, Mitchell and their families.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To allow an argument challenging the respondents’ entire
    residency requirements scheme at this stage would be a substantial shift of
    focus of this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We direct that the litigation guardians of the appellant and
    Christopher Beauchamp pay to the respondents the sum of $15,000 for costs of
    this appeal, inclusive of disbursements and GST.  The two litigation guardians shall be jointly and severally
    responsible to pay this amount and the respondents should attempt to agree
    among themselves as to the apportionment.  If there is any difficulty with the implementation of the costs order,
    we may be spoken to.                                   “Dennis O’Connor A.C.J.O.”</p>
