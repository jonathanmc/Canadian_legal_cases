    hog operation and wish to double the capacity of their hog raising facility to
    2,000 hogs. The facility will contain a large reservoir for nutrient
    storage.  The Peacocks received approval
    of their Nutrient Management Plan, as required under the <i>Nutrient Management Act</i>, <i>2002</i>,
    S.O. 2002, c. 4 (the Act), and corresponding Regulation 267/03 (the
    Regulation).  Among the requirements of
    the Regulation is that the new nutrient storage facility must be at least 100
    metres from a municipal well. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant municipality, Norfolk County, passed By-law
    64-Z-2003 (the By-law) that prohibits siting intensive livestock operations and
    associated nutrient facilities within Sensitivity Areas 1 and 2.  The appellant submits that the Peacocks’
    proposed expansion is located within Sensitivity Area 2, also referred to as
    the two-year capture zone.  The two-year
    capture zone refers to an area from which it would take two years or less for
    contamination introduced at that point to reach the municipal well.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Norfolk County takes the position that the Peacocks must
    comply with both the Regulation and the By-law and, that the By-law prohibits
    the proposed expansion.  The Peacocks
    and the intervener, the Ontario Pork Producers’ Marketing Board, take the
    position that the Regulation supersedes the By-law, pursuant to s. 61 of the
    Act and only compliance with the Regulation is necessary.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 61(1) of the <i>Nutrient
    Management Act</i> provides: “A regulation supersedes a by-law of a
    municipality or a provision in that by-law if the by-law or provision addresses
    the same subject-matter as the regulation.”  There are two main issues on appeal.  The first is whether s. 61 specifies that, for conflicts between the
    Regulation and a municipal by-law, a test different from the impossibility of
    dual compliance test set out in <i>11957 Canada Ltée (Spraytech Société
    d’arrosage) v. Hudson (Town)</i>, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 241 is to be used.  Second, whether the Regulation and the
    relevant provision of the By-law address the same “subject-matter”. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge ruled in favour of the respondents
    having found that the Regulation addressed the same subject-matter as the
    By-law, and as such, superseded the By-law. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.
    Section 3.31.4(c) of the By-law does address the same subject-matter as the
    Regulation.  As a result the Regulation
    renders that portion of the By-law inoperative.</p>

    Background</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:
normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In response to public concern regarding the potential for
    groundwater contamination resulting from intensive livestock operations,
    Norfolk County initiated a groundwater study on December 4, 2001. An interim
    control by-law was passed on December 19, 2001 that temporarily prohibited the
    use of land, buildings and structures within Norfolk County for intensive
    livestock operations. The results of the groundwater study prompted the passing
    of By-law 64-Z-2003, which amended Norfolk County’s Zoning By-law 1-1999.  The By-law seeks to protect the municipal
    water wells by restricting land use in designated areas, which pose an unacceptable
    risk to the water source.  It establishes
    Sensitivity Areas, ranked one through four where Sensitivity Area one
    represents the highest potential risk area.  Land within each Sensitivity Area is subject to various land-use
    restrictions.  The By-law lists three
    categories of land use (A, B and C) and each category lists various activities
    and their corresponding risk to municipal water supplies, category A posing the
    highest risk.  Intensive livestock
    operations and associated nutrient facilities are not listed under any of these
    three categories.  They are addressed by
    a separate provision, s. 3.32.4(c), which specifically prohibits such
    operations and facilities within Sensitivity Areas 1 and 2.  The appellant submits the Peacocks’ proposed
    expansion is located in Sensitivity Area 2, and is thus prohibited by the
    By-law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:
normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The province enacted the <i>Nutrient
    Management Act</i> in response to the Walkerton tragedy as part of an overall
    plan to protect Ontario’s drinking water.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a>  The Act provides province-wide standards
    governing the distribution, storage, spreading, record keeping of nutrients and
    the construction of their associated facilities.  Under the Act, all farmers expanding or building new intensive
    livestock operations must obtain provincial approval of a Nutrient Management
    Strategy and Plan to ensure that their nutrient management meets the provincial
    standards.  The Peacocks have obtained
    this approval for their expansion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The specific area of concern between the Regulation and the
    By-law is the minimum distance separation required from a municipal well.  Section 63(1)(b) of the Regulation prohibits
    the construction or expansion of a permanent nutrient storage facility, if the
    facility is located within 100 metres of a municipal well.  The By-law prohibits nutrient storage
    facilities within Sensitivity Areas one and two.  On the facts of this case, this has the effect of increasing the
    distance that the Peacocks expansion must be from the municipal well to more
    than 100 metres. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the By-law is necessary to protect
    the quality of water found in the municipal well and that while the Regulation
    prohibits construction within 100 metres it is silent on construction located
    in excess of 100 metres from a municipal well.  Using the principle of enhancement, the appellant submits that the
    By-law enhances the environmental protections found in the Regulation and, thus
    both can co-exist.  Any overlap between
    the Regulation and By-law can be resolved by use of the principle of
    accommodation.  The appellant also
    submitted such principles should be invoked because of the precautionary
    principle, to prevent environmental degradation where there is a threat of
    serious or irreversible damage demonstrated by the groundwater study.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents submit that construction is permitted as long
    as the requirements delineated in the Act and its Regulations have been met and
    that it is irrelevant whether or not the By-law enhances the protection of a
    municipal water source.  They submit
    that the proper test to be applied is not the impossibility of dual compliance
    test but rather the test stipulated in s. 61 of the Act.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The intervener submits that the main issue is whether the
    By-law and the Regulation address the same subject-matter, as provided in s. 61
    of the Act.  It submits that the
    Regulation does address the same subject-matter as the By-law as both the
    substance and purpose are the same.</p>

    64-Z-2003 amended the municipality’s Zoning By-law 1-1999 so as to prohibit
    placing nutrient storage facilities within a “two-year capture zone” or
    Sensitivity Area 2 as defined in the By-law.  </span>The two-year capture zone was determined as a result of an expert
    groundwater study which studied the tendency or likelihood of contamination
    reaching a specified position in the groundwater system after introduction at
    some location above the uppermost aquifer.  The limit of the two-year capture zone is the point from which it would
    take two years for contamination introduced at that point to reach the

    Hudson’s by-law regulating the use of pesticides despite the existence of
    provincial legislation in that field.  After recognizing that in environmental matters the precautionary
    principle should apply, the majority of the court applied the impossibility of
    dual compliance test, taken from the federal-provincial context, to the
    provincial-municipal context.  The court
    commented that there was a fine line between laws that legitimately complement
    each other and those that invade another government’s protected legislative sphere.  At para. 38, the court held the impossibility
    of dual compliance test requires first, that the municipal by-law deal with a
    similar subject as the provincial statute, and then that “obeying one
    necessarily means disobeying the other”.  Only then can the court find that a municipal by-law is inconsistent
    with a provincial statute.  The court
    held that as a general principle, “the mere existence of provincial or federal
    legislation in a given field does not oust municipal prerogatives to regulate
    the subject-matter” (para. 39). However, the court also stipulated that the
    impossibility of dual compliance test would not apply when, as in the present

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the application judge was in error
    and makes two principal submissions.  The first is that, because the <i>Nutrient Management Act </i>and
    Regulation prohibit the construction of a nutrient storage facility within a
    100 metres of a municipal well, their silence allows construction of a storage
    facility beyond the 100 metre zone.  The
    municipality’s By-law does not conflict with the Act and Regulation because it
    expands on the prohibition and enhances the protection of its municipal
    wells.  As set out in <i>Spraytech</i>,
    it is legitimate for municipalities, as trustees of the environment, to enhance
    the protection provided by another sphere of government; they are at the level of
    government closest to the citizens affected and should thus be responsive to
    their needs.  The impossibility of dual
    compliance test should be applied to this case.  Since the municipal and provincial provisions are not in
    conflict, the by-law must be complied with.  See <i>Spraytech</i>, <i>supra</i> at paras. 3, 27, 31-38.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, in oral submissions, the appellant argued that the
    expression “addresses the same subject-matter” should be interpreted as meaning
    “addresses the same purpose.”  Since the
    purpose of the <i>Nutrient Management Act</i> and Regulation is nutrient
    management and protection of the environment is only an ancillary purpose, and
    the purpose of the By-law is the protection of the environment and the
    municipality’s source of water, they address different purposes or
    “subject-matter” and s. 61 does not apply.</p>

    out in <i>Spraytech</i>, the impossibility of dual compliance test only applies
    in the event that the relevant provincial legislation does not specify a
    different test.  Section 61 of the </span><i>Nutrient
    Management Act</i>, in my view, specifies the test to be applied in the event
    that the Regulation and a local by-law or provision of a by-law address the
    same subject-matter.  If they address
    the same subject-matter, s. 61(2) specifies that the by-law or provision of the
    by-law is “inoperative while the regulation is in force.”  Section 61 therefore clearly displaces the
    impossibility of dual compliance test.</p>

    intent of the Act.  The Act sought to
    achieve a balance between environmental protection and sustainable
    agriculture.  If municipalities were
    free to become involved and deal with the same subject-matter as is dealt with
    by the Act and Regulation and impose a higher environmental standard, then the
    balance created by the Act as intended by the province would be interfered

    made to the legislative debates.  The
    Standing Committee on General Government discussions on June 3, 2002 made it
    clear that the drafters of the legislation did not intend to allow for
    municipal by-laws to enhance the environmental protection provided by
    regulation under the <i>Nutrient Management Act</i>.  The proposal to amend s. 61 to allow the municipality to provide
    higher standards for the protection of the public or the environment than are
    provided in the Regulation was defeated.<a

    I disagree with the use of the pith and substance test in this case.  The pith and substance analysis is used to
    characterize a law for the purposes of determining which head of power it falls
    within.  See <i>Kitkatla Band v. British
    Columbia </i>(<i>Minister of Small Business, Tourism and Culture</i>), [2002] 2
    S.C.R. 146 at para. 52.  As such, it is
    an exercise in categorizing laws into existing and known heads of power.  The pith and substance analysis attempts to
    determine the true purpose and effect of the law and then is used to ascertain
    whether the enacting legislature possesses the jurisdiction to enact.  That is not an issue in this case.  The municipality clearly has the authority
    to enact the impugned by-law.  It is
    also appropriate, as set out in <i>Spraytech</i>, <i>supra</i>, that a broad
    approach to the interpretation of municipal powers be taken.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    issue in this case, however, is not whether the municipality had the authority
    to enact it but rather, whether the properly enacted by law “addresses the same
    subject matter” as the Regulation.  This
    demands a comparison of all of the similarities between the two laws and is a
    much different interpretive exercise than attempting to characterize the
    dominant feature of a law.  By focusing
    only on the dominant feature of each law, the pith and substance analysis
    essentially ignores the subsidiary features of each law.  This is acceptable in a division of powers
    exercise as each head of power is relatively broad and the analysis seeks only
    to slot the impugned law into one category or another.  In this case, such an analysis is
    inappropriate as the test under s. 61 is much broader, and demands a comparison
    of the similarities of the law.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Additionally,
    the most common and frequent legislative uses of the phrase “subject matter”
    indicate that the interpretation of “subject matter” should be
    content-driven.  For example, the term
    is frequently used to describe the content of dispute, such as a hearing,
    inquiry, complaint, application, motion or arbitration and the content of a
    physical item such as a contract, program, lobbying effort or permit.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my
    view, these past legislative uses, although not determinative, suggest that
    “subject matter” is more than just the dominant feature, and must include an
    examination of the content, <i>i.e.</i> what is included in the By-law and the
    Regulation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    by limiting the application of s. 61 to situations where the dominant feature
    of the municipal by-law is the same as the dominant feature of the Regulation
    the “overall management of nutrient materials in relation to farm operations”,
    s. 61 is rendered to be virtually meaningless.  Assuming that municipalities have the authority to enact by-laws that
    provide for the “overall management of nutrient materials in relation to farm
    operations”, I doubt that a municipality would set out to do so in the
    comprehensive manner done by the <i>Nutrient Management Act</i> and
    Regulation.  This means that, in
    practice, s. 61 would never apply.  Municipalities would be free to manage each element of a farm’s
    operation provided only that they did not do so by way of a by-law whose
    dominant feature was “the overall management of nutrient materials in relation
    to farm operations.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fourth,
    my colleague restricts the expression “subject matter” to the dominant feature
    of the Regulation, the overall management of nutrient materials.  Although I agree that the broad purpose of
    the Act has to be taken into account in the interpretation of the expression
    “subject matter”, I do not believe that it ought to be limited in the manner
    suggested.  The expression “subject
    matter” is to be interpreted in its context.  Section 61 applies where a by-law “<u>addresses</u> the same subject
    matter” [underlining added].  The
    English Oxford Dictionary defines the verb “address” as follows:</span></p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;'><span
lang=EN-US>(a)       write
    the name and address of the intended recipient on …</span></p>
  <p align=left style='

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    verb “addresses” is quite broad.  In
    light of the differences in the nature of their authority and jurisdiction,
    municipalities and the Province can choose to “address the same subject matter”
    in very different ways.  It follows that
    a by-law prohibiting the siting of nutrient storage facilities within a given
    distance of a municipal well is addressing the same subject matter as a regulation
    containing the same prohibition, albeit for a different distance.  It is irrelevant, in my view, that the
    Regulation provides for an overall management scheme and that the zones of
    prohibitions are only one aspect of the numerous requirements.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fifth,
    if Part VII of the Regulation “siting and construction standards” had been
    adopted as a separate regulation rather than as a part of the comprehensive
    Regulation, the “subject matter” of that Regulation would be siting and
    construction standards of nutrient storage facilities.  The dominant feature of this smaller
    regulation would be the same as that of the By-law’s.  Such a narrow interpretation of s. 61 is, in my view, at odds
    with the modern approach to statutory interpretation which requires that
    statutes be read “in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary
    sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the
    intention of parliament.” see Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1
    S.C.R. 27 at para. 21 citing E.A. Driedger, <i>Construction of Statutes</i> 2d
    ed. (Toronto Butterworths, 1983) at 87.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    assuming that the pith and substance test is the correct approach, my colleague
    has concluded that the dominant feature of the Regulation is management while
    the dominant feature of the By-law is prohibition.  Because the prohibition provisions in the Regulation are an
    incidental feature of the Regulation, they are not to be considered in the
    analysis.  Even on a pith and substance
    analysis, I do not reach the same conclusion.  In a pith and substance analysis, the Supreme Court has held that “the
    effect of the law cannot be disregarded” See <i>Reference re</i> <i>Employment
    Insurance Act</i> <i>(Can.) ss. 22 and 23</i>, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 669 at para.
    27.  The analysis must look at both the
    purpose and the effect of the impugned law.  <i>Kitkatla Band v. British Columbia </i>(<i>Minister of Small Business,
    Tourism and Culture</i>), <i>supra,</i> at paras. 53-54.  The effect of the legislation includes both
    its legal effect and its practical effect.  The court must look at the effects that flow from the impugned
    provisions themselves and then the “side effect” that flow from the application
    of the impugned provisions.  The
    Regulation sets out a comprehensive scheme that manages all aspects of
    nutrients in an agricultural operation.  The Regulation includes provisions about set backs from municipal wells,
    and where and when nutrient storage facilities can be located.  The relevant portion of the By-law does
    exactly the same thing; it tells an agricultural operation where and when
    nutrient storage facilities can be located.  The legal and practical effect of the By-law is to add supplementary
    requirements to the approval of the province under the <i>Nutrient Management
    Act</i>.  As indicated, the Province’s
    intent was not to allow municipalities to have this role.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Before
    turning to my conclusion, I will address two additional matters.  As indicated, s. 61 provides that we are to
    consider the By-law or a provision of the By-law and then determine whether
    this By-law or provision thereof addresses the same subject matter as the
    Regulation.  Justice Blair is of the
    opinion that s. 61 does not provide that you compare the By-law or provision
    thereof with a provision of the Regulation.  In my view, the structure of s. 61 is not indicative of an intention to
    limit the comparison of the By-law or provision thereof to the dominant feature
    of the whole of the Regulation.  The
    section is structured in this way so as to minimally impair any by-law adopted
    by a municipality.  Taken together, s.
    61(1) and s. 61(2) provide that it is only the portion of the By-law that
    addresses the same subject matter as the Regulation that is rendered
    inoperative, not the whole of the By-law.  Applied to the present case, this means that those portions of the municipality’s
    By-law prohibiting other uses, such as foundries, petroleum product and
    refining remain in force.  Only that
    portion of the By-law which addresses the same subject matter as the Regulation
    is rendered inoperative.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally,
    in his concluding section, my colleague states that an interpretation of
    s.&nbsp;61 that would render a municipality powerless to prevent the
    construction of a manure storage facility serving 2000 hogs beyond the
    100-metre prohibition zone established pursuant to the <i>Nutrient Management
    Act</i> is absurd.  I understand him to
    be saying that the result is absurd.  To
    the extent that he is expressing concern that municipalities should not be
    powerless when faced with potentially dangerous threats to their sources of
    drinking water, I share the concern.  In
    reaching my conclusion, I should not be taken as saying that municipalities
    should not have input when a nutrient management plan is put forward nor am I
    suggesting that the respondents and the Province or body charged with making a
    decision as to whether to approve the plan ought not to consult with the
    municipality and consider its legitimate concerns.  I am simply saying that the <i>Nutrient Management Act</i> cannot
    be interpreted so as to lead to the result sought by the municipality.</span></p>

line-height:normal'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Public concern was local too.  Reacting to those concerns in 2001, the County of Norfolk initiated a
    wide-ranging study regarding potential ground water contamination in 2001.  The results of the study led the
    Municipality to enact By-law 64-Z-2003, which amends By-law 1-1999 of the
    former Town of Simcoe.  By-Law 64-Z-2003
    (“the By-Law”) is designed to protect the Town’s water supplies from
    contamination associated with a variety of land uses – including intensive
    livestock operations and the manure storage facilities associated with them –
    and to secure the long-term protection of the Town’s potable water supply.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Overlapping governmental requirements generated by these
    provincial and municipal initiatives are the source of the conundrum in which
    the respondents, Marilyn and Reginald Peacock, now find themselves.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. and Mrs. Peacock operate a large farming enterprise on the
    outskirts of Simcoe.  Part of their
    enterprise consists of an intensive hog facility – presently housing one
    thousand hogs – on a fifty-acre parcel of land that is located a little north
    west of one of the Town’s water well sites.  Those wells supply a substantial amount of drinking water to the inhabitants
    of Simcoe.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Peacocks wish to expand their existing hog operation by
    doubling its size to one that will house two thousand hogs.  To do so, they need to build an addition to
    their barn and to the manure storage facility associated with the operation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The proposed expansion brings into play the provisions of both
    the Regulation and the By-law.  Under
    the NMA and the Regulation, the Peacocks must obtain provincial approval of a
    nutrient management plan, which they have done.  They were able to obtain this approval partly because their
    facility is located eight hundred and twenty-three metres from the Town’s well
    site and therefore does not run afoul of the requirement in s. 63 of the
    Regulation that a manure storage facility may not be constructed within one
    hundred metres of such a site.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The proposed expanded facility does run afoul of the By-law,
    however.  The By-law prohibits many land
    uses that are considered potential water contaminants within certain designated
    sensitivity areas.  One of the
    prohibited land uses consists of “intensive livestock operations and associated
    storage facilities” (section 3.31.4 (c)).  The Peacock’s hog undertaking clearly falls within that category and it
    is located in what is known in the By-law as a Sensitivity 2 Wellhead Protected
    Area (“WHPA”).  Such an area is defined,
    not by distance from the wellhead, but by the time it is estimated a water
    contaminant will take to flow to the well from its source.  A Sensitivity Area 2 is a two-year capture
    zone, that is, an area from which it would take two years or less for
    contamination introduced at the source to reach the municipal well.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is thus a tension between the operation of the
    Regulation (which does not prohibit the proposed expansion and pursuant to
    which it has been approved) and the operation of the By-law (which prohibits
    the expansion).  The broad question
    raised on appeal, therefore, is whether the By-law is inoperative because the
    Province has occupied the legislative field in a manner that ousts the ability
    of the Municipality to enact a setback by-law, based on local conditions, and
    designed to protect the health and safety of its inhabitants from potential
    groundwater contamination.</p>

    Board, argue that the By-law is not operative because it has been superseded by
    the NMA and the Regulation.  In this
    respect, they rely on the provisions of s. 61 of the NMA, which state:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='

    A regulation supersedes a by-law of a municipality or a provision in that

    words “addresses the same subject matter as the regulation” in subsection
    61(1).  Justice Fedak accepted the
    Peacocks’ arguments on the application and granted judgment declaring the
    By-law to be superseded by the Regulation.  My colleague, Rouleau J.A., has also concluded that the By-law, and the
    provision of the By-law in question, address the same subject matter as the
    Regulation.  Accordingly, he holds that
    the By-law is inoperative as it has been superseded by the Regulation, and he
    would dismiss the appeal.  </p>

    for the reasons he states.  The <i>Spraytech</i> test only applies where the relevant provincial legislation does not specify a
    different test.  Section 61(1) of the
    NMA does that.  The test is whether the
    By-law or a provision of the By-law addresses the same subject matter as the
    Regulation.  Only if the answer to that
    question is “No” is it necessary to consider the impossibility of dual
    compliance yardstick.  If the answer is
    “Yes”, the Regulation trumps the By-law, or its provision, which are superseded

    the legislative direction of one level of government (here, the Province) will
    prevail over that of another level of government (the Municipality), it is
    appropriate in my view to consider, as part of the “entire context”, the
    legislative framework in which the subordinate government’s powers have been
    exercised, as well as the principles relating to the exercise of those powers.  In this case, the respondent’s By-law is
    specifically enacted in accordance with the power to pass zoning by-laws under
    s. 34(1) of the <i>Planning Act</i>,<a

    take a broad approach to the interpretation of municipal powers, one that
    recognizes the importance of permitting municipalities to attend to the welfare
    of their citizens.  In <i>Spraytech,
    supra</i>, para. 3, L’Heureux-Dubé J. commented that matters of governance are
    now examined through what she called “the principle of subsidiarity”, that is,
    the proposition that law making and implementation are often best achieved at a
    level of government that is closest to the citizens affected and thus most
    responsive to their needs.  This court
    expressed a similar view in <i>Croplife Canada v. City of Toronto</i> (2005),
    75 O.R. (3d) 357 (C.A.).  At para. 37,
    Feldman J.A. said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I
    conclude that absent an express direction to the contrary in the <i>Municipal
    Act, 2001</i>, which is not there, the jurisprudence from the Supreme Court is
    clear that municipal powers, including general welfare powers, are to be
    interpreted broadly and generously within their context and statutory limits,
    to achieve the legitimate interests of the municipality and its inhabitants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted above, the By-law is specifically enacted pursuant to
    the Municipality’s powers to enact zoning by-laws under the <i>Planning Act</i>.  Section 71 of the <i>Planning Act</i> provides that in the event of conflict between its provisions and those of any
    other general or special Act, the provisions of the <i>Planning Act</i> prevail.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

style='font-size:10.0pt'> </span> While
    I do not think that s. 71 of the <i>Planning Act</i> is dispositive of the
    question whether the Regulation (promulgated under the NMA) prevails over the
    By-law (enacted pursuant to the <i>Planning Act</i>), because the conflict is
    not between the provisions of the two Acts, the existence of the s. 71 override
    is supportive of the view that care should be exercised before the municipal
    legislative initiative – otherwise properly enacted – is declared
    inoperative.  For a similar approach,
    see the “principles of accommodation” view expressed by Morden J.A. in <i>Attorney
    General for Ontario v. City of Mississauga</i> (1981), 33 O.R. (3d) 395 at
    410-411 (C.A.). </p>

    61(1) of the NMA – with the foregoing interpretive framework in mind – I take
    the view that “subject matter” in relation to a by-law, or a provision in a
    by-law, or a regulation, is not the equivalent of “any individual matter” that
    may be addressed or dealt with in the by-law, its provision or the
    regulation.  “Subject matter” is broader
    than “an individual matter”.  It may be
    that the “subject matter” addressed by a by-law, or a provision of a by-law, is
    the same as an individual matter dealt with within a regulation – in this case,
    a minimum distance separation from the municipal well site.  It does not follow, however, that the “subject
    matter” of the By-law or its provisions is necessarily the same as the “subject
    matter” of the Regulation.  The “subject
    matter” of a by-law, or a provision of a by-law, or a regulation, in my view,
    has to do with its main thrust, or – to adopt the constitutional language used
    to resolve conflicts between levels of government – its pith and substance or
    dominant feature.  </p>

    considering the meaning of the phrase “addresses the same subject matter as the
    Regulation” in s. 61(1) of the NMA.  In <i>Spraytech</i> the Supreme Court of Canada acknowledged that analytical tools used in division
    of powers jurisprudence can be useful in sorting out similar tensions between
    provincial (or federal) and municipal legislation: see para. 36.  The constitutional “pith and substance”
    approach does not fit perfectly, of course, because, as Rouleau J.A. notes,
    what is at issue here is not an exercise “in categorizing laws into existing
    known heads of power . . . to ascertain whether the enacting legislature
    possesses jurisdiction to enact”.  However, what <i>is</i> at play here is the analogous exercise of
    determining what is the dominant feature (or “pith and substance”) of the
    By-law, its provision, and the Regulation – the very exercise that underlies a
    division of powers debate.  </p>

    the overall content of a thing (a contract, a program, an order or judgment,
    policy or conveyance), or to illustrate the grant of jurisdiction over a

    Regulation in this case, then, it is necessary to assess their “tenor”, their
    “dominant or most important characteristic”, their leading feature, their true
    character or pith and substance.  First,
    though, it is necessary to consider precisely what the comparators are under s.

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To repeat, s. 61(1) provides that a regulation supersedes a
    municipal by-law, or a provision of that by-law “if the by-law or provision
    addresses the same subject-matter as the regulation”.  The structure of the language is not parallel.   It does not say: “. . .if the by-law or
    provision addresses the same subject-matter as the regulation <u>or a provision
    of the regulation</u>”.  Thus the
    relevant comparators here are the By-law, or the provision of the By-law in
    question (section 31.3.4(c)), on the one hand, and the Regulation as a whole,
    on the other hand.  This supports the
    view, expressed above, that the comparison is not to be made between the
    subject matter of the By-law or its provision and an individual matter that may
    be dealt with within the Regulation, but rather between the “subject matter” of
    the By-law or its provision and the more extensive “subject matter” of the

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This approach to the interpretation of s. 61(1) of the NMA
    using the “pith and substance” of the By-law, it provision, and the Regulation
    as an analytical framework is appropriate in the context of this case, in my
    view.  It is a principled approach,
    comparing as it does the most important or dominant features of the provincial
    and municipal laws under consideration, and permitting various types of
    environmental protection initiatives to co-exist and achieve their intended
    purposes without frustrating the intentions of either the Legislature or the
    municipality. It also permits the competing approaches that are in play to be
    balanced in a fitting way.  These
    competing approaches include the underlying provincial design, expressed in the
    NMA and Regulation, for protecting the environment by developing a
    province-wide regulatory scheme to control and minimize the potentially
    poisonous effects of manure and other “nutrients” associated with intensive
    farming operations on drinking water supplies, while at the same time
    preserving agricultural development.  But they also include the need for municipalities to be able to respond
    to the health, safety and general well being of their inhabitants, based on local
    needs and conditions – a part of the contextual analysis for the interpretation
    of s. 61(1) referred to above.</p>

line-height:normal'>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both these approaches have their merits.  There is no doubt that the Province has the
    legislative authority to impose its will on the municipalities, should it
    choose to do so, and to impose a scheme that leaves no room whatever for local
    response.  The question, however, is
    whether it has done so in this case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted above, courts have recently emphasized the need to
    take a flexible approach to the interpretation of municipal powers, recognizing
    the importance of the need for local governments to respond to local
    concerns.  At the same time, I recognize that during the debates in
    Committee and in the Legislature prior to the enactment of the NMA, the
    importance of a consistent province-wide system of regulation was
    emphasized.  Indeed, an attempt by the
    Opposition to amend what is now s. 61 to add a provision that a regulation
    would not supersede or render inoperative a by-law imposing higher standards
    for environmental protection, was defeated: Ontario, Legislative Assembly,
    Standing Committee on General Government, <u>Official Reports of Debates
    (Hansard)</u>, G-3 (3 June 2002).  This
    is evidence of legislative intention that the provincial scheme is to prevail
    when the competing provincial and municipal provisions address the same subject
    matter; in those circumstances, the municipality is not permitted to “top up”
    the provincial mechanism with a by-law imposing higher standards.  However, the pre-enactment debates do not
    assist in resolving the “addresses the same subject matter” discussion, in my
    view.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the
    interpretation I have placed on the By-law and the Regulation does not
    frustrate the intention of the Legislature.  The issue is not what members may have said in the course of
    parliamentary debates – although, as indicated, that may provide some evidence
    of what they intended – but rather the issue is what the Legislature’s
    intention was as expressed in the enactment.  Here, it does not appear that in the context of the setback provisions
    of the NMA and the Regulation, the Legislature gave effect to a “no enhancement
    by municipalities” intention.  I make
    this observation because the NMA itself gives the Lieutenant Governor in
    Council the power to make regulations only respecting <u>minimum</u> distance
    separation requirements (s. 6(2)(u)).  This suggests that other distance separation requirements that are not
    less than the minimums imposed by the Regulation may exist elsewhere.  But where? “Minimum” in relation to what?  The only other logical source of such requirements would be land use
    zoning by-laws passed by municipalities pursuant to the <i>Planning Act</i> R.S.O. 1990, c. P.13.  It is implicit
    from this that municipalities may pass distance separation or setback
    provisions that will enhance or “top up” the minimums provided for in the NMA
    and Regulation where local conditions and the protection of the health and
    safety of the local citizens so require.  I shall return to the issue of enhancement at the conclusion of these
    reasons when I deal further with whether the <i>Spraytech</i> test has been met
    on the facts of this case.</p>

    the purpose of the legislation as well as its effect: <i>Kitkatla Band v.
    British Columbia (Minister of Small Business, Tourism and Culture)</i>, [2002]
    2 S.C.R. 146 at 171.  Here, it may be

    include, amongst other things – as aspects of the nutrient management scheme –
    regulations respecting the use, application, holding and storage of nutrient
    materials, and the construction and location of holding and storage sites.  The dominant feature of the Regulation is
    not the provision for a one hundred metre setback from municipal wells

    incidental feature of the Regulation, but not to the subject matter of the
    Regulation, which is the overall management of nutrient materials.  I do not see this as rendering s. 61 of the
    NMA meaningless.  The Municipality
    cannot institute a regime of regulating or managing the nutrient material
    aspects of farm operations.  It does not
    follow, in my opinion, that the Municipality may not utilize its zoning powers

    respondents to cooperate in retaining an engineer to report on the structural
    integrity of their manure storage facility and identify necessary remedial
    work, to install monitoring equipment with respect to groundwater quality, and
    to prepare a protective plan for spreading manure.  My colleague concludes that this demonstrates the By-law is

    the letter as simply an attempt by the Municipality to work out a resolution of
    the specific groundwater contamination problem identified by the consultants
    report, with the respondents.  The
    respondents are, after all, citizens of the Municipality with a substantial
    farming enterprise, and a resolution of the problem was in everyone’s

    cannot be constructed within the one hundred metre set-back from the well.  As noted above, the setbacks provided for in
    the Regulation are only minimum setbacks.  Once the “same subject matter” hurdle has been successfully overcome,
    there is nothing to prevent the respondent from enacting a by-law that provides
    for more stringent or enhanced requirements in terms of distance separation,
    based on local exigencies.</p>

    must not be forgotten that we are talking about “nutrients” here only in the
    euphemistic sense that legislators like to use in framing their
    enactments.  What we are talking about
    is <u>manure</u> and its contaminating effects on surface and ground
    water.  On the facts of this case, the
    Peacocks’ new manure storage facility is to be constructed some eight hundred
    and twenty-three metres from the Town’s municipal well site – significantly
    beyond the on hundred metre set-back called for in the Regulation.  However, the logical extension of the
    argument made by the appellants and the intervener is that the Province has
    implemented the Walkerton Inquiry Recommendations by providing that a farmer
    can construct a manure storage facility to collect the waste from two thousand
    hogs – <i>three quarters of a million gallons</i> per year – within the length
    of a football field from a municipal well that provides drinking water to the
    community.  And the local municipality
    is powerless to deal with the situation, even though they have a thorough and
    well-founded study demonstrating that, given local geological and soil
    conditions, contamination seeping into the soil from a greater distance than
    one hundred metres will endanger the municipality’s supply of drinking
    water.  In my view, such an interpretive
    result is absurd and could not have been intended by the Legislature.  For the reasons set out above, I do not
    believe that it was.</p>

    Blair also referred to s. 6(2)(u) in stating that his interpretation of s. 61
    is not contrary to the legislative intent.  <span lang=EN-US>In my view, the
    existence of s. 6(2)(u) does not negate the clear legislative intent to create
    a system exclusively managed by the provincial government.   Section 6(1) provides the Lieutenant Governor
    with a broad power to make regulations (a) establishing standards respecting
    the management of nutrients used by and on agricultural operations and (b)
    establishing standards respecting farm practices. Section 6(2) is a list of
    examples of areas in which the Lieutenant Governor <i>may</i> make regulations
    and specifically says, “without limiting the generality of subsection
    (1).”  By providing in s. 6(2)(u) that
    the Lieutenant Governor can pass a regulation setting minimum distance
    separation between a manure storage facility and a place or feature such as a
    municipal well and then stating in s. 61 that a regulation supercedes a by-law
    addressing the same subject matter, the legislative intent revealed in the
    debates is reinforced rather than weakened.  Those debates demonstrate an intent that when a municipal by-law imposes
    higher environmental standards for nutrient management, s. 61 is meant to make
    the Regulation supercede the By-law.</span></p>
