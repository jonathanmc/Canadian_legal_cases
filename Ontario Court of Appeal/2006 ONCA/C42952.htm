style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from his conviction by a court composed
    of Van Melle J. and a jury for importing cocaine contrary to s. 6(1) of the <i>Controlled
    Drugs and Substances Act</i>.  The only
    issue at trial was whether the appellant knew that the luggage trolley in his
    possession contained the cocaine.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown relied upon a statement that the appellant was said
    to have made to one of the arresting officers.  The statement was neither audio nor videotaped.  The appellant denied making the inculpatory
    parts of the statement.  The appellant
    submits that the trial judge did not adequately direct the jury as to the
    inference to be drawn from the police failure to audio or videotape the
    statement.  The appellant also submits
    that the trial judge erred in holding that the appellant could be
    cross-examined on his record for drug offences.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with both submissions and accordingly would allow the

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On May 12, 2001, the appellant arrived at Pearson International
    Airport on a flight from Jamaica.  At
    the time, the appellant had a suitcase and a luggage trolley.  He was referred to secondary inspection
    where he was questioned and his luggage examined.  The inspector’s attention was drawn to the trolley because
    although it appeared brand new, the screws holding it together appeared
    worn.  When a hole was drilled into one
    of the poles of the trolley, the inspector discovered that it contained
    cocaine.  In all, the trolley contained
    212 grams of cocaine.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was arrested by the customs inspectors and
    turned over to Constables Mitchell and Armstrong of the R.C.M.P.  The appellant was given his rights under the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms </i>and he spoke to duty counsel.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Taking

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The R.C.M.P. constables took the appellant to their cells in
    Terminal One to be processed.  Upon
    arrival, the appellant was placed in an interview room where Constable Mitchell
    questioned him.  Constable Armstrong
    stayed in an adjacent room.  The
    interview room is equipped with video recording equipment.  As I understand the evidence, Constable
    Armstrong could see what was taking place in the interview room by observing
    the video monitor in the office but was unable to hear any of the conversation
    in the interview room.  He estimated
    that the appellant was with Constable Mitchell for about 45 minutes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Constable Mitchell testified that he did not use the video
    equipment to record the interview with the appellant.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a>  At one point in his testimony he said he did
    not use the equipment because “we were experiencing some problems with an echo
    sound”.  However, he conceded that he
    also did not test the equipment on this occasion and later in his testimony he
    agreed that the statement could have been recorded.  Because of the problem with the video equipment, the officers
    were using handheld audio tape recorders to tape statements to supplement the
    video equipment.  But, he also did not
    have his handheld recorder with him and he had no explanation for why he did
    not have his recorder with him.  When
    asked why he did not bring the recorder with him when he was contacted by the
    customs inspectors to arrest the appellant, Mitchell said, “I didn’t think of
    it at the time, no.”  In any event, his
    normal practice at the time was to take a written statement. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Constable Mitchell testified that he began taking the
    statement at 10:27 p.m.  He wrote out
    the questions and the appellant’s answers.  The written statement is as follows:</p>

    knowing about it.  Moreover, he had been
    advised by duty counsel to remain silent.  He saw Mitchell taking notes and assumed he was accurately taking down
    what he said.  He is nearly illiterate

    short, he lent his own suitcase to a family friend, but when it was not
    returned to him and he was ready to return to Canada, the family friend
    arranged to lend him another suitcase and luggage trolley.  He was to return the suitcase and trolley to
    a person in Toronto.</p>

    asked that the trial judge instruct the jury in accordance with this court’s
    decision in <i>R. v. Moore-McFarlane</i> (2001), 160 C.C.C. (3d) 493 at para.
    65 that where “the police deliberately set out to interrogate the suspect
    without giving any thought to the making of a reliable record, the context
    inevitably makes the resulting non-recorded interrogation <i>suspect</i>”.  The trial judge held that <i>Moore-McFarlane </i>applies only at the admissibility stage and since she had held that the
    statement was admissible, the special instruction was not required.  Unfortunately, the trial judge did not have
    the benefit of this court’s later decision in <i>R. v. Swanek</i> (2005), 28
    C.R. (6<sup>th</sup>) 93, which I will discuss later.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the trial judge gave the following instruction
    concerning the reliability of the appellant’s statement to the police:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            When Constable Mitchell says what
    Rohan Wilson said to him, you have to decide whether you believe Rohan Wilson
    made the statement or any part of it. Regardless of who the witness is, it is
    still up to you to decide whether you believe him. In deciding whether Rohan
    Wilson actually said these things or any of them, you should use your common
    sense. Take into account the condition of Mr. Wilson and of Constable Mitchell
    at the time of the interview.  Consider
    the circumstances in which the interview took place. Bear in mind anything else
    that may make Constable Mitchell’s story more or less reliable.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            Whether a witness has recorded a
    conversation or taken notes about it does not itself determine how reliable
    that witness’ testimony may be. It is, however, one of the things that you may
    consider in deciding whether or how much of the witness’ testimony to believe.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;'>                                    Unless you decide that Rohan Wilson made a particular
    remark or statement, you must not consider it in deciding this case. Some or
    all of the statements may help Mr.&nbsp;Wilson in his defence. You must
    consider those remarks that may help Mr. Wilson along with all of the other
    evidence unless you are satisfied that he did not make them. In other words,
    you must consider all the remarks that might help Mr.&nbsp;Wilson even if you
    cannot decide whether he said them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, for the following reasons, this was not an
    adequate instruction.  This court
    briefly dealt with this issue in <i>R. v.
    Swanek</i>.  In that case, the accused
    argued, for the first time on appeal, that the trial judge should have directed
    the jury that it was dangerous to rely upon an unrecorded inculpatory statement
    that was not confirmed by other evidence.  Doherty J.A. at para. 12, noted the concern with unrecorded oral
    statements:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Counsel makes
    the valid point that while those who are regularly involved in the criminal
    process are familiar with the historical unreliability of oral confessions
    attributed to persons in custody, a jury may well not appreciate that
    unreliability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, he held at para. 13 that in a proper case a special
    instruction should be given to the jury:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>If the police
    failure to make a proper recording of an alleged inculpatory statement is in
    issue at trial, I think a trial judge should tell the jury that the failure to
    make a proper recording is an important factor for the jury to consider in
    deciding whether to rely on the police version of the alleged statement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Swanek</i>, the court
    held that there was no error in failing to give the instruction since the
    failure to make a proper recording was not an issue at trial and no special
    instruction had been requested by the accused.  That is not the case here: defence counsel raised the failure to
    videotape in his examination of the officers and asked the trial judge to give
    a special instruction. I note that in <i>Swanek</i> the concern was with an oral statement that
    was not signed by the accused and only reduced to writing in the officers’
    notebooks. However, given the uncontested evidence that the appellant was all
    but illiterate, nothing turns on the fact the statement in this case was
    signed. The point remains that because of the failure to audio or video record
    the circumstances or manner of obtaining the statement cannot be objectively
    assessed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Most of the cases that have considered the issue of videotaping
    of statements have been concerned with the impact of the failure to videotape
    on admissibility. However, in my view, and for the reasons set out in <i>Swanek</i>, in appropriate circumstances, a special instruction should be
    given to the jury where the accused contests the accuracy of the non-recorded
    statement.  Over a decade ago, Carthy
    J.A. in his concurring reasons in <i>R. v.
    Barrett</i> (1993), 82 C.C.C. (3d) 266 (Ont. C.A.) at 270, noted the central
    feature a confession can play in a criminal case and the importance of having
    an accurate record of what occurred: and he said this:  “On this determinative issue of conviction
    the police force has, by its own choice in this case, denied the court the
    opportunity of an undeniable record of what led to the &quot;conviction&quot;.
    Given the modest cost of videotape equipment, such critical evidence should
    not, in fairness, be restricted to sworn recollection of two contesting
    individuals as to what occurred in stressful conditions months or years ago.
    The evidence is admissible under our present rules, but everyone involved in
    the criminal justice system should make reasonable efforts to better serve its
    ultimate ends.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These concerns do not relate solely to voluntariness; they
    also relate to the jury’s task in attempting to decide whether the accused
    confessed as alleged by the police.  <i>Barrett</i> was overturned on appeal to the
    Supreme Court of Canada (1995), 96 C.C.C. (3d) 319, on the basis that the
    failure of the trial judge to give reasons for admitting the statement did not
    amount to an error of law.  That
    decision does not take away from the common sense identified by Carthy J.A.’s
    reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. Oickle</i> (2000), 147 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.) at para. 46, Iacobucci J. held that a
    video or audio recording “can greatly assist the trier of fact in assessing the
    confession”.  The trier of fact, of
    course is concerned not solely with voluntariness but whether the statement was
    made and the truth of the contents of the statement.  It must also be said that at the present time the failure to
    electronically record the statement does not itself render the statement
    inherently suspect.  Iacobucci J. made
    that clear in <i>Oickle</i> at para.
    46.  To the same effect is the decision
    of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in <i>R. v.
    Ducharme</i> (2004), 182 C.C.C. (3d) 243 at para. 46:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The difficulty
    is that until either the Supreme Court articulates or Parliament legislates the
    duties of the police and lays out a protocol to be followed, the common law
    definition of voluntariness will remain in effect. That being the case, it
    cannot be said that the failure to videotape or electronically record will
    automatically mean the exclusion of the evidence on a <i>voir dire</i>.<a href="#_ftn2"

line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, there must be other circumstances before a trial judge
    would be entitled to give the special instruction sought in this case.  One set of circumstances was identified in <i>R. v Moore-McFarlane</i> at para. 65:  “where the suspect is in custody, recording
    facilities are readily available, and the police deliberately set out to
    interrogate the suspect without giving any thought to the making of a reliable
    record, the context inevitably makes the resulting non-recorded interrogation
    suspect”.  Admittedly, in that case,
    Charron J.A. was concerned with voluntariness, but for the reasons set out
    above the concern for accuracy that arises at the voluntariness stage also
    applies at the guilt or innocence stage.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, it was open to the jury to find that the police
    deliberately set out to interrogate the appellant without giving any thought to
    the making of a reliable video or audio record.  The jury should therefore have been instructed along the lines
    suggested in <i>R. v. Swanek</i> that this
    was an important factor to consider in deciding whether to rely on the
    officer’s version of the statement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent submits that the jury would have understood the
    concern with the reliability of the written statement because both counsel in
    their jury addresses acknowledged the problem stemming from the lack of an
    audio or video recording.  I do not
    accept that position.  While defence
    counsel in his address did review the circumstances of the taking of the
    statement and pointed out that Constable Mitchell could have used the pocket
    recorder, he expressly told the jury that the legal effect of those
    circumstances would be explained by the trial judge:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>So he’s in a
    room specifically designed to audio and video-record a confession or a
    statement generally and he chose not to use that. Now, why is that important?
    Now, Her Honour will suggest what the law says about that but the logical
    reason why, over time, we’ve moved from having them written to having them
    video, doesn’t take a lawyer to explain that. Obviously a video statement is
    much more trustworthy than having to take someone’s word for how this all
    happened and that wasn’t utilized.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, after the jury addresses, the trial judge ruled
    that she would not give this special instruction.  While Crown counsel also gave a fair recitation of the facts in
    her jury address, she invited the jury to draw the inference that had their
    been a recording it would simply have confirmed Constable Mitchell’s version:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It is trite to
    say that given the accused’s version of events, it would be very nice at this
    trial to have a perfect video or audio record.  Obviously we may not even have been here.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, counsel’s views on the law are no substitute for
    a proper legal direction from the trial judge.  Given the central role played by the statement, I cannot be satisfied
    that the absence of a proper instruction did not prejudice the appellant’s
    defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, it seems to me that the instruction the trial judge
    gave could have had the effect of bolstering the officer’s credibility, because
    he, unlike the appellant, had taken notes of the conversation.  For convenience, I set out a portion of the
    instruction set out more fully above:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Whether a
    witness has recorded a conversation or taken notes about it does not itself
    determine how reliable that witness’ testimony may be. It is, however, one of

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, the instruction far from attracting the jury’s attention
    to the potential unreliability of the officer’s evidence may well have had the
    effect of giving it added credit.</p>

    cross-examined pursuant to s. 12 of the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i> on the two
    drug convictions, although the possession for the purpose of trafficking
    conviction would be referred to only as possession of cocaine.  The trial judge gave the following reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In reviewing the
    criminal record of the accused and the relevant authorities, I am satisfied
    that the probative value of the two drug convictions, as edited, outweigh the

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I also find that
    they are sufficiently proximate in time.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I further find
    that the assault conviction of January 2004, while not prejudicial to the
    accused, is not probative either.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In summary, the

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the trial judge erred in permitting
    cross-examination on the two drug convictions.  The fact that the appellant’s defence was lack of knowledge did not make
    the prior drug convictions either more probative or less prejudicial on the
    sole issue for which they were admissible, the appellant’s credibility.  To the contrary, to use the convictions as
    evidence of knowledge would engage the prohibited line of reasoning that
    because the appellant had drug convictions he would have a propensity to commit
    the offence.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In at least two decisions, this court has held that drug
    convictions are of little probative value on the issue of credibility.  In <i>R. v. Brand</i> (1995), 98 C.C.C. (3d)
    477 (Ont. C.A.)<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[3]</span></a>, the trial
    judge held that on his trial for trafficking in drugs, the accused could be
    cross-examined on his entire record including three prior convictions for
    trafficking in narcotics.  This court
    held, at p. 480, that this was an error:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>We think the
    learned trial judge erred and applied the wrong test in the exercise of his
    discretion. He was obliged to weigh and balance the risks for and against
    exclusion, bearing in mind the evidentiary value of previous convictions
    admitted pursuant to s. 12, and the fair trial of the accused. <i>The three
    convictions in question had no probative value with respect to the appellant's
    credibility but were highly prejudicial</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, there is no principled distinction between the
    trafficking charge in <i>Brand</i> and the importing charge in this case.  Further, while convictions for simple
    possession of cocaine are less prejudicial than trafficking convictions, they
    involve the same concern, that the jury will misuse the evidence and, as did
    the trial judge, use the convictions for similar offences as evidence of
    knowledge.  As LaForest J. said in <i>R.
    v. Corbett</i> (1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.) at 436:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Clearly, too,
    the more similar the offence to which the previous conviction relates to the
    conduct for which the accused is on trial, the greater the prejudice harboured
    by its admission. I agree fully with the opinion of the court in <i>Gordon,
    supra</i>, at p. 940, that: </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A special and even more difficult problem
    arises when the prior conviction is for the same or substantially the same
    conduct for which the accused is on trial. Where multiple convictions of
    various kinds can be shown, strong reasons arise for excluding those which are
    for the same crime because of the inevitable pressure on lay jurors to believe
    that &quot;if he did it before he probably did so this time&quot;. <i>As a
    general guide, those convictions which are for the same crime should be
    admitted sparingly; one solution might well be that discretion be exercised to
    limit the impeachment by way of a similar crime to a single conviction and then
    only when the circumstances indicate strong reasons for disclosure, and where
    the conviction directly relates to veracity</i>. [Emphasis added.] </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I think that a
    court should be very chary of admitting evidence of a previous conviction for a
    similar crime, especially when the rationale for the stringent test for
    admitting &quot;similar fact&quot; evidence is kept in mind.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although he was speaking in dissent, the factors identified by
    LaForest J. for excluding a prior criminal record were approved by Dickson
    C.J.C. at pp. 404-5 speaking for the majority.  Because the trial judge misapprehended the probative value of the
    evidence, she never engaged in the proper weighing of probative value versus
    prejudicial effect.  In my view, the prejudicial
    effect of the drug convictions outweighed whatever limited probative value they
    might have had with respect to the appellant’s credibility.  I would take a different view if the
    appellant had put his character in issue or adopted the stance that he did not
    know what cocaine looked like but counsel for the respondent fairly conceded
    that the appellant did not do so and that the convictions could not be admitted
    on that footing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsel does, however, submit that this would be a
    proper case to apply the proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  He points out that the trial judge attempted
    to minimize the prejudice by having the parties refer to the trafficking
    offence solely as a possession offence.  She also gave the correct instructions to the jury as to the limited use
    of the evidence and told the jury that offences involving dishonesty would be
    more important than others with respect to credibility and that possession of
    cocaine was not an offence of dishonesty.  There is considerable merit to this submission and if this error stood
    alone, this might be an appropriate case for applying s. 686(1)(b)(iii).  However, given the cumulative effect of the
    two errors, it is my view that we should not exercise our discretion in favour
    of dismissing the appeal.</p>
