    trial judge, the Honourable Denis Power of the Superior Court of Justice,
    ordered Mr. Martin to pay spousal support in the amount of $27,000 per month.  The
    $27,000 per month took into account the monies that the husband had regularly
    paid into the RCA.  Mr. Martin appeals the order of the trial judge in respect
    of spousal support and also appeals the order of costs at trial in the amount
    of $49,544.58.  No application for leave to appeal has been made in respect
    of the costs award at trial.  However, counsel for Mr. Martin advised at
    the outset of the oral argument that he would not proceed with the costs
    appeal if the appeal in respect of spousal support was dismissed.  </p>

    his reasons for judgment, the trial judge made reference to Mr. Martin’s
    evidence concerning his rationale for directing such large amounts of money
    to savings through his RCA.  At paragraph 50 of his reasons, the trial judge
    said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mr. Martin was asked by his counsel why he had
    decided to pay such a large amount of money into a retirement fund.  His
    answer was that there were two reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) It gave him an opportunity to take advantage
    of possible tax savings; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) He was employed in a very insecure position.  It
    had taken him seven years to obtain another head coaching position after
    his dismissal in St. Louis and it was important to the family in order that
    it could live comfortably in the future.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mrs. Martin testified that while in Ellisville
    [St. Louis] “we lived well – we saved – we didn’t over spend – we lived a
    good life”.  Saving became a fact of life in the Martin household.</p>

    contract with the Florida Panthers was negotiated in expectation of a labour
    disruption which in fact occurred as a result of a management lock-out in
    the fall of 2004.  The contract with Mr. Martin provided that in the event

    following comments at paragraph 61 of his reasons for judgment:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>While giving his testimony, Mr. Martin was asked
    what were his future plans for saving.  His response was that he would try
    to continue the percentage of savings he had maintained in past years.  He
    said that there was a chance that he could be fired and he wanted to save
    money for the future.  He also said that his desire was to continue as an

    Martin was to receive $1,700,000 as her share of the family property as a
    result of a settlement on the eve of trial.  The evidence at trial was that
    when Mrs. Martin receives her full equalization payment, she will earn an
    investment income (calculated at 5.5 %) of $81,472.58 per annum.  A similar
    calculation at 5.5 % will produce investment income for Mr. Martin of $182,476.43.  </p>

    he considered the application of the spousal support provisions in s. 15.2
    of the <i>Divorce Act (Canada)</i>, (1985), S.C. 1986 c. 4. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also conducted a survey of the relevant case law with particular
    reference to <i>Moge v. Moge</i> [1992] 3 S.C.R. 813 (S.C.C.).  The trial
    judge’s reading of <i>Moge</i> led him to the conclusion that the savings
    factor should be included in his award of spousal support.  At paragraph
    150 of his reasons, the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In paragraph [74] [actually paragraph 73] of the <i>Moge</i> decision,
    L’Heureux-Dubé J. said: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…In so far as economic circumstances permit, the
    Act seeks to put the remainder of the family in as close a position as possible
    to the household before the marriage break-down…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Here, the position of the household before the
    marriage breakdown included a lifestyle based on a combination of spending
    and saving for the future, presumably, for the benefit of both spouses.  Therefore,
    when addressing the question of whether Mrs. Martin enjoys the same, less,
    or a better standard of living after separation, the savings factor cannot
    be excluded from the equation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded at subparagraphs 171 (k) and (p) of his reasons for
    judgment:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(k)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding
    that Mr. Martin’s current saving practices are consistent with a pattern
    developed during cohabitation, it would not be fair and reason-able to deduct
    from his gross income the amount of these savings for the purpose of determining
    his ability to pay support and the quantum of support.  Prior to separation
    the benefit of the savings accrued to both spouses – that was a substantial
    component of the standard of living they enjoyed.  Therefore, Mrs. Martin
    must now receive an amount of support that will permit her to control her
    own savings; - i.e., the amount of spousal support should be such as to promote
    the economic self-sufficiency of both spouses, not just Mr. Martin; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(p) While Mr. Martin’s present employment contract
    appears to be a fairly secure one, it seems reasonable to assume that, as
    a professional sport’s coach, there is still good reason to assume that his
    continued employ-ment is fraught with uncertainties.  Accordingly, both parties
    need to adopt a policy of saving for the future given that there is no meaningful
    pension in place.  Mrs. Martin’s budgeting needs, therefore, are but one
    factor to be considered in determining the quantum of support.</p>

    the result, the trial judge ordered Mr. Martin to pay spousal support of
    $12,500 per month for the period coincident with the NHL lock-out following
    which he is to pay Mrs. Martin $27,000 per month.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for Mr. Martin submits that the main issue at trial was whether the amount
    of spousal support was to be based on need as determined by the accustomed
    standard of living during the marriage or whether Mrs. Martin was entitled
    to some additional amount in excess of need for compensatory reasons.  The
    thrust of counsel’s argument is that Mrs. Martin was awarded an amount of
    spousal support that was more than double the need demonstrated by her own
    evidence.  Counsel observed that $27,000 per month is $12,000 more than Mrs.
    Martin showed on her financial statement and $14,500 more than the monthly
    interim support that Mr. Martin was paying prior to trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for Mr. Martin argues that the award of spousal support in this case constitutes
    a redistribution of Mr. Martin’s capital which this court has said is a forbidden
    practice.  In <i>Marinangeli v. Marinangeli</i> (2003), 66 O.R. (3d) 40 (Ont.
    C.A.); (2003), 38 R.F.L. (5th) 307, the court said at para. 74:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In determining need, the court is to be guided
    by the principle that the spouse receiving support is entitled to receive
    the support that would allow her to maintain the standard of living to which
    she was accustomed at the time cohabitation ceased.  In addition, there is
    jurisprudence to the effect that a spouse is entitled to an increase in the
    standard of living such as would have occurred in the normal course of cohabitation:
    see <i>MacDougall v. MacDougall </i> (1973), 11 R.F.L. 266, 1973 CarswellOnt
    130 (On. S.C.) <i>per</i> Henry J.  See also <i>Linton v. Linton</i> (1990),
    1 O.R. (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.).  At the same time the court must guard against
    redistributing the payor’s capital in the guise of support.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>For the same proposition, counsel
    also relies on <i>Mannarino v. Mannarino</i> (1992), 43 R.F.L. (3d) 309 (Ont.
    C.A.); <i>Willenze-Davidson v. Davidson</i> (1997), 98 O.A.C. 335, (Ont.
    C.A.); and, <i>Hoar v. Hoar</i> (1993), 62 O.A.C. 50; (1993), 45 R.F.L. (3d)
    105, (Ont. C.A.).  All of the three aforesaid cases refer to the caution
    against awarding lump sum payments as a redistribution of capital.  In the <i>Hoar</i> case,
    the court was also critical of using a retroactive child support order as
    a device to redistribute capital.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each
    of the above cases can be distinguished from this case.  Counsel for Mr.
    Martin submits that there are no reported cases where a spouse has been awarded
    a substantial sum above that which was required to maintain that spouse.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    spite of the able argument of counsel for Mr. Martin, I am not persuaded
    that the trial judge’s order for spousal support is tantamount to a redistribution
    of capital.  It is certainly a very high award.  However, it became clear
    during oral argument that we are not being asked to interfere on any basis
    other than that the trial judge engaged in a forbidden redistribution of
    capital.  If he did not do so, then the order should stand.  There is no
    issue about Mr. Martin’s ability to pay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    indicated above, this case appears to be unique.  A decision was made by
    Mr. Martin to invest large sums of money in a pension savings plan to protect
    against the high degree of insecurity that attaches to the career of a professional
    hockey coach.  Mr. Martin established his personal savings plan to benefit
    the family including his wife.  Mr. Martin testified that the personal savings
    plan was important to the family in order that it could live comfortably
    in the future.  Mrs. Martin testified that saving became a fact of life in
    the Martin household.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mrs.
    Martin was a stay-at-home mom.  Due to the tremendous amount of travel that
    Mr. Martin was obliged to do, he was often away.  The day-to-day responsibility
    of raising the children and the running of the household fell to Mrs. Martin.  The
    family moved 9 times in 13 years – it was Mrs. Martin and the children who
    bore the brunt of adjusting to life in a new community.  While there is no
    suggestion that Mr. Martin was not a loving and caring father, his ability
    to participate in the lives of his children was obviously more limited than
    that of Mrs. Martin.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    all the circumstances, Mrs. Martin became totally dependent upon her husband
    not only for her day-to-day needs but for her future financial security.  It
    is conceded that Mrs. Martin is not required to seek employment in the workforce.  Her
    day-to-day needs continue and her need for financial security continues.  In
    my view, the award of spousal support in this case meets both those needs. </p>
