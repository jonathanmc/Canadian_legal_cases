    a diplomatic note dated March&nbsp;9,&nbsp;2000, the United States requested
    the extradition of the applicant, a Canadian citizen residing in Toronto.  Extradition
    was sought for the purpose of prosecuting the applicant on federal narcotics
    offences, specifically conspiracy to distribute cocaine.  The applicant had
    been indicted on that charge in the United States in November&nbsp;1999.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    April 5, 2000, the Minister authorized extradition proceedings against the
    applicant, listing the Canadian corresponding offences as conspiracy to traffic
    in cocaine and conspiracy to possess cocaine for the purpose of trafficking.  The
    extradition hearing proceeded in September&nbsp;2002.  On October&nbsp;11,&nbsp;2002,
    Hawkins&nbsp;J. discharged the applicant, concluding that there was no evidence
    that the applicant conspired in the United States with others to traffic
    in cocaine.  The Minister appealed and in January&nbsp;2004 this court allowed
    the appeal (182 C.C.C. (3d) 176), set aside the discharge order, and directed
    that the applicant be committed for extradition.  An application for leave
    to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from this court’s order was dismissed
    in June&nbsp;2004.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    January&nbsp;2005, after considering submissions made on behalf of the applicant,
    the Minister ordered the applicant surrendered to the United States.  The
    applicant then commenced these proceedings.  He is on bail.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      is alleged that the applicant was a member of a drug conspiracy headed
      by a man named Nester Fonseca.  According to the material provided by the
      American authorities, Fonseca withdrew large amounts of Canadian currency
      from Canadian banks in Toronto, arranged to have that currency converted
      to American currency and provided it to other members of the conspiracy
      to purchase cocaine in southern Florida.  Those co-conspirators brought
      the cocaine through the United States back to Fonseca in Toronto who arranged
      for its distribution by others, including the applicant.  The material
      referred to several meetings between the applicant, Fonseca and other alleged
      conspirators in Toronto between February 1998 and June 1998.  On four occasions
      Fonseca provided the applicant with large amounts of cocaine for sale.  In
      total, the applicant received about thirteen to fifteen kilograms of cocaine.  He
      paid Fonseca $33,000 per kilogram.  </span></p>

      for the applicant submits that, unlike the extradition judge, the Minister
      had the responsibility to monitor the extradition request to ensure that
      the American authorities were not exceeding their jurisdictional grasp
      in seeking the applicant’s extradition.  Counsel further argues that this
      court can review the Minister’s decision that the American assertion of
      jurisdiction over the applicant was proper because the decision rests on
      a misapprehension of the facts and a misunderstanding of the Canadian law
      made applicable by Article 3(2) of the <i>Treaty on Extradition between
      the Government of Canada and the Government of the United States of America</i>,
      Can. T.S. 1976 No. 3, as am. by Can. T.S. 1991 No. 37 (the
    “Treaty”).  Counsel argues that the Minister mistakenly viewed the American
    allegations as alleging an international drug conspiracy when in fact the
    allegation alleged only a conspiracy to distribute narcotics in the United
    States.  Counsel also submits that the Minister was wrong in law when he
    indicated that a Canadian court would take jurisdiction over a person charged
    with conspiracy to traffic in narcotics in Canada, even if that person had
    no connection to Canada and did nothing in Canada to advance the alleged
    conspiracy.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      Minister has a responsibility to monitor requests for extradition to ensure
      compliance with the <i>Extradition Act</i>, S.C.&nbsp;1999, c.&nbsp;18
      (the
    “Act”), and any applicable extradition treaty:  <i>United States of America
    v. Lapine</i> (1994), 87 C.C.C. (3d) 385 at 391&#8209;92 (S.C.C.).  The Act
    and applicable treaties impose pre&#8209;conditions and limitations on the
    Minister’s exercise of his surrender powers.  The Minister must monitor requests
    for extradition to ensure that those pre&#8209;conditions and limitations
    are honoured by him when exercising the surrender power.  If, as with Article
    3(2) of the Treaty, the situs of the alleged offence can impact on the Minister’s
    surrender powers, the Minister must take account of the situs of the offence
    in exercising his or her surrender powers.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      Minister’s responsibility to monitor compliance with the Treaty and the
      Act cannot be equated with a freestanding duty to determine whether the
      requesting state’s assertion of jurisdiction over the offence is well founded.  <i>Re
      McVey</i> (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) makes it clear that the determination
      of jurisdiction of the foreign court is a matter first for the foreign
      authorities and ultimately for the foreign court.  The Minister is entitled
      to rely on the validity of the assertion of jurisdiction made by the requesting
      state.  That is not to say that the jurisdiction of the foreign court can
      never be challenged in the surrender phase of the extradition process.  An
      individual whose extradition is sought could demonstrate that the assertion
      of jurisdiction by the requesting state is so clearly baseless under the
      law of the requesting state, or so clearly antithetical to Canadian notions
      of jurisdiction, that the Minister would be entitled to refuse to surrender
      the subject of the extradition request.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>That
      is not this case.  Nothing was placed before the Minister to suggest that
      under American law the American Federal Court would not have jurisdiction
      over the offence.  In fact, the material placed before the Minister offered
      implicit support for the jurisdiction of the American court over the conspiracy
      alleged in the extradition request.  That material reveals that several
      of the co&#8209;conspirators have pled guilty in Federal Court in the United
      States and received significant jail sentences.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Article
      3(2) of the Treaty does require that the Minister consider the locus of
      the offence alleged by the requesting state.  It provides:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>When the offense
    for which extradition is requested was committed outside the territory of
    the requesting State, the executive or other appropriate authority of the
    requested State shall grant extradition if the laws of the requested State
    provide for jurisdiction over such an offense committed in similar circumstances.  If
    the laws in the requested State do not so provide, the executive authority
    in the requested State may, in its discretion, grant extradition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Article
      3(2) assumes that the offence for which extradition is sought was committed
      outside of the United States.  Article 3(2) provides that if Canadian courts
      would take jurisdiction over the offence
    “in similar circumstances” the extraterritorial situs of the offence places
    no limitation on the Minister’s power to surrender.  If, however, Canada
    would not take jurisdiction over the offence then the Minister has a discretion
    to refuse extradition because of the extraterritorial nature of the offence.<a

      applicant submitted that, as he had had no involvement in the American
      component of the scheme, the Minister should view the offence for which
      the applicant’s extradition was sought as having occurred entirely outside
      of the territory of the United States, thereby triggering a consideration
      of Article 3(2) of the Treaty.  The Minister accepted this argument but
      went on to conclude:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In my view,
    Canada would have jurisdiction over an offence committed in similar circumstances
    and thus article 3(2) of the treaty mandates surrender, subject, of course,
    to other relevant considerations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      explaining his conclusion the Minister made three observations.  First,
      he noted that the material provided by the United States alleged that the
      applicant was a member of “a general conspiracy which had as its object
      the obtaining of drugs in the United States of America and their transportation
      across the Canadian border for sale here.”  Second, the Minister observed
      that under Canadian law a Canadian court would take jurisdiction over an
      allegation of conspiracy to traffic in narcotics in Canada if the agreement
      was made in Canada, or if any overt act in furtherance of the agreement
      took place in Canada.  Third, the Minister considered the “substantial
      connection” test for jurisdiction over criminal offences developed in <i>R.
      v. Libman</i> (1985), 21 C.C.C. (3d) 206 (S.C.C.).  He concluded that the
    “substantial connection” test would give a Canadian court jurisdiction over
    the conspiracy alleged in the extradition request in “similar circumstances”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      see no error in the Minister’s analysis.  He did not misapprehend any material
      fact.  The United States did allege that the applicant was a party to a
      transnational conspiracy involving the illicit purchase, transportation,
      and sale of drugs in the United States and Canada.  I attach no significance
      to the fact that the allegation is one of a conspiracy to distribute cocaine
      in the United States rather than one of conspiracy to import or export
      and distribute cocaine.  An agreement that involves the purchase, transportation,
      and sale of cocaine in more than one country is an international drug conspiracy,
      even if it is prosecuted as a conspiracy to distribute simpliciter.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      applicant’s submissions confuse the question of proof with the question
      of jurisdiction.  It may be that the American authorities will in the end
      fail to prove that the applicant was a party to the “general conspiracy” alleged.  Jurisdiction
      over the offence does not, however, turn on whether the prosecution will
      eventually be able to prove that an individual accused was a party to that
      offence.  Jurisdiction over the offence must be determined at the outset
      and must look to the allegations made by the prosecution.  The Minister
      correctly characterized the nature of the allegations made by the American
      authority.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      agree with the Minister’s conclusion that a Canadian court would assume
      jurisdiction in “similar circumstances”.  The American allegation is one
      of conspiracy to distribute cocaine contrary to American federal drug laws.  It
      alleges that the agreement was initially made in Canada and that overt
      acts in furtherance of the conspiracy were committed by some of the conspirators
      in the United States, but not by the applicant.  If Canadian prosecutorial
      authorities alleged a conspiracy to violate Canadian drug laws initially
      entered into in the United States involving overt acts committed by some
      of the conspirators in Canada, a Canadian court would have jurisdiction
      over the conspiracy charge:  see <i>R. v. Connolly and McGreevy</i> (1894),
      1 C.C.C. 468 at 505 (Ont. H.C.);  see also Matthew R. Goode, <i>Criminal
      Conspiracy in Canada</i> (Toronto:  Carswell, 1975) c. 4; <i>United States
      v. Downing</i> (1931), 51 F.2d 1030 at 1031 (2d. Cir.); <i>D.P.P. v. Doot</i>,
      [1973] A.C. 807 (H.L.),<i> </i>Viscount Dilhorne at 823, Lord Pearson at
      835.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a>  These cases demonstrate that the Canadian
      court would have jurisdiction over the offence even if not all of the alleged
      co-conspirators had acted within Canada.  Jurisdiction over an accused
      is distinct from jurisdiction over an offence.  Jurisdiction over an accused
      is irrelevant to the operation of Article 3(2) of the Treaty.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

      Minister’s reference to <i>Libman</i>,<i> supra</i>, confirms that in his
      view the general approach to jurisdiction over criminal offences developed
      in <i>Libman</i> yields the same result as do the cases that have specifically
      addressed jurisdiction over conspiracy allegations.  I think this assessment
      is correct.  If an alleged conspiracy had as its object the violation of
      Canadian drug laws, and if overt acts in furtherance of that purpose were
      committed in Canada, there would clearly be a “substantial connection” between
      Canada and the alleged conspiracy sufficient to found jurisdiction over
      the offence.</span></p>

      in the United States that the Minister’s decision to surrender the applicant
      was unreasonable and resulted in an infringement of the applicant’s constitutional
      right to remain in Canada.  In making that argument, counsel began with
      the assertion that the applicant did not commit any crime against American
      law.  As he puts it in his factum:</span></p>

      one begins with the premise that the applicant committed no crime against
      American law, the decision to surrender the applicant to the US authorities
      must violate his rights under s.&nbsp;6(1).  The Minister could not proceed
      from that premise.  To the contrary, the requesting state asserted that
      the applicant had committed a serious offence against American federal
      drug laws.  The Minister proceeded on the basis that the requesting state
      had made the allegation in good faith and, therefore, had a valid interest
      in the prosecution of the applicant.  He was entitled to do so.  The reasonableness
      of the Minister’s decision to surrender the applicant cannot be meaningfully
      assessed if one begins from the premise that the applicant committed no
      crime against American laws. </span></p>

      the applicant’s contention that the Minister’s decision to order him surrendered
      was unreasonable because “the impact of his [the applicant’s] offences
      was felt only in Canada” assumes that the applicant was not a party to
      the conspiracy which involved the purchase and transportation of cocaine
      in the United States.  In determining where the negative impact of the
      alleged criminal conduct was felt, the Minister had to look to the allegations
      made by the United States and not to the applicant’s description of the
      scope of the conspiracy that was alleged against him. </span></p>

      find no error in the Minister’s applications of the relevant principles

      been convicted in the United States were co&#8209;operating with the authorities.  These
      individuals were prepared to testify that the applicant was aware the cocaine
      he was selling was being smuggled into Canada from the United States.  According
      to these individuals the applicant had been involved in discussions about
      the smuggling of cocaine into Canada.  Second, the Minister was given an
      updated report on the status of the proceedings in the United States against
      the other co&#8209;conspirators.  Six had pleaded guilty to the charge

      that had been given to the Minister and was invited to make further submissions

      argued that the new information from the co-conspirators was so inherently
      unreliable that it should not be considered by the Minister.  In the alternative,
      counsel requested disclosure from the Minister “of all such information”.  Finally,
      counsel argued that, as at least one of the co&#8209;conspirators had been
      returned to Canada to serve his jail sentence, the Minister should direct
      a second “<i>Cotroni</i>” assessment in that their location of potential

      by counsel for the applicant, a second “<i>Cotroni</i>” assessment had
      been made in the light of the return of two of the co-conspirators to Canada.  That

      which must take into account Canada’s international obligations and the
      specifics of the particular case.  The applicant is entitled to know the
      criteria that the Minister will apply in exercising that discretion and
      he is entitled to know the substance of the information upon which the
      Minister has based the exercise of that discretion:  see <i>United States

    assessments prepared by counsel in the Justice Department.  He argues that
    he could not make his case against surrender without knowing exactly what
    was in the “<i>Cotroni</i>”
    assessments prepared by counsel.  I disagree.  The applicant knew the criteria
    that the Minister would apply in determining the question of surrender.  He
    had the substance of all of the information that the Minister considered
    in making that decision.  I fail to see how disclosure of counsel’s assessment
    of how those relevant factors should be weighed was necessary in order for
    the applicant to make his case that on a proper “<i>Cotroni</i>”
    assessment surrender was not warranted.  The surrender process is not adversarial.  The
    Minister’s position when considering whether to surrender under the Act cannot
    be equated with that of a judge called upon to make a decision based on the
    submissions of competing parties.  </span></p>

      submission that disclosure of the substance of the anticipated evidence
      provided the applicant with ample information to address the significance
      of that information to his surrender:  <i>United States of Mexico v. Hurley</i>, <i>supra</i>,

      statements as well as “all available information concerning the obtaining

      Minister should not rely on any of the information allegedly coming from
      the co&#8209;conspirators in the fall of 2004.  It would appear that the

      determination that the conspiracy occurred outside of the territory of
      the United States, but that a Canadian court would take jurisdiction in
      similar circumstances by virtue of the overt acts committed by the conspirators
      in Canada, the appellant’s knowledge of activities in the United States

      the jurisdiction of a Canadian court over a conspiracy allegation in similar
      circumstances would not depend on whether the co-conspirators who did not
      act in Canada were aware of the overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy
      that did occur in Canada.  The extent of the applicant’s knowledge of the
      activities that occurred in the United States in furtherance of the conspiracy
