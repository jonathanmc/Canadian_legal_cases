    on charges of robbery, robbery while wearing a mask, trafficking in cocaine, 
    breach of bail conditions, and fail to attend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

    month maximum set out in s. 42(15) of the YCJA. He also raises the quantum

    appellant argues that the sentence was excessive having regard to his pre-sentence

    while the circumstances of this youth and these offences mandate a maximum 
    sentence of three years, the trial judge erred by failing to credit the appellant

    the appeal and vary the appellant&#8217;s sentence to thirty months. </p>

    the trial judge&#8217;s jurisdiction on the trafficking offence to impose two years&#8217; 
    probation concurrent to the sentence imposed for the robbery-related charges. 
    I agree with the Crown that the trial judge lacked jurisdiction to impose 
    the probation and I would vary the sentence to delete the term of probation.

style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>The appellant was arrested on May 20, 2004 
    and charged with trafficking in cocaine and possession of the proceeds of 
    crime. He was released on bail on May 25. On May 28, the appellant failed 
    to attend court. A bench warrant was issued for his arrest. He was apprehended 
    on July 13. He was further charged with a June 30 robbery, breach of recognizance, 
    and failure to attend. In December, the appellant pleaded guilty to all the 
    charges.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span></p>

    </span></span> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>The circumstances 
    surrounding the robbery are serious. While on bail, the appellant robbed a 
    Tim Hortons store. He was wearing a facemask and carrying a loaded, sawed-off 
    22-calibre rifle. He pointed the rifle at the Tim Hortons&#8217; employee and worked 
    the bolt-action on the rifle to demonstrate his serious intent. After taking 
    about $70, the appellant fled the store. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>The appellant, who was fifteen years old 
    at the time of the offences and sixteen at the time of sentencing, had a difficult 
    childhood. He had a youth court record consisting of three convictions. In 
    December 2002, he was sentenced to six months&#8217; secure custody (in addition 
    to four months of pre-sentence custody), plus twelve months&#8217; probation for 
    robbery and escaping lawful custody. In September 2003, he was sentenced to 
    eighty hours of community service for assault. In April 2004, he was given 
    eighteen months&#8217; probation for breach of probation, escaping custody, and 
    breaching an undertaking. </p>

    </span></span> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>At the time of 
    the offences, the appellant suffered from learning deficits, exhibited a defiant 
    and unmotivated attitude, and kept company with a negative peer group. At 
    the time of sentence, he had demonstrated behavioural improvements while in 
    the structured environment of pre-sentence custody, had developed positive 
    relationships, and had achieved 4.5 high school credits. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> On the trafficking charge, the federal prosecutor and the appellant&#8217;s 
    counsel were in general agreement that the appellant should receive a six-month 
    sentence. However, there was an issue about the appropriate allocation of 
    the six months&#8217; pre-sentence custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The provincial Crown took the position that the fact that the trafficking 
    and robbery charges had been heard together should not operate to reduce the 
    sentence for the robbery. They were different offences committed at different 
    times. He argued that the appellant&#8217;s pre-sentence custody therefore should 
    be attributed exclusively to the trafficking conviction. It was his position 
    on the robbery-related charges that the appellant should be sentenced to a 
    further three years. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In response, the appellant&#8217;s counsel urged a total custodial sentence 
    of two years for the robbery-related charges given the youth&#8217;s age, the absence 
    of physical harm to the victim, his progress in custody, and his guilty plea.

    a concurrent thirty-three-month sentence for being disguised during the robbery, 
    time served for trafficking (after credit for four months of pre-sentence 
    custody), one day for breach of recognizance (in addition to one month pre-sentence 
    custody), and one day for the fail to appear (in addition to one month of 
    pre-sentence custody). The trial judge also imposed a three-year firearms 
    prohibition and two years&#8217; probation concurrent with the robbery sentence.

    </span> The Crown took the position at the appellant&#8217;s sentencing that, since 
    the trafficking and the robbery offences were unrelated, separate sentences 
    could be imposed for each offence, even if the resulting total sentence exceeded 
    the s. 42(15) three-year maximum. I disagree.</p>

    </span> The plain language of s. 42(15) demonstrates that Parliament decided 
    otherwise. Section 42(15) specifically provides for a maximum three-year sentence 
    where the youth is sentenced &#8220;with respect to different offences&#8221;. If Parliament 
    meant to constrain a youth sentence only for those offences arising out of 
    the same or related transactions, it could easily have done so. It did not. 
    Accordingly, I conclude that Parliament intended to restrict the maximum total 
    sentence to three years regardless of whether the offences arose from the 
    same or different transactions. </p>

    an appropriate sentence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Although &#8220;take into account&#8221; is not defined in the YCJA, s. 2(2) provides 
    that &#8220;[u]nless otherwise provided, words and expressions used in this Act 
    have the same meaning as in the <i>Criminal Code</i>.&#8221; Under the Code, in 
    sentencing an adult offender, the trial judge may &#8220;take into account&#8221; time 
    spent in pre-sentence custody: </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;mso-list:none;'>Presumably, 
    Parliament intended &#8220;take into account&#8221; to be interpreted consistently in 
    both the YCJA and in the Code. Under the Code, adult offenders are presumptively 
    credited with time served because time served is part of the punishment imposed.

    </span> This was recognized in <i>R. v. Wust</i> (2000), 143 C.C.C. (3d) 129 
    (S.C.C.). That case considered whether a trial judge had the discretion under 
    s. 719(3) to deduct time served from a mandatory minimum sentence when such 
    a deduction would reduce the sentence pronounced to one that was less than 
    the mandatory minimum. After considering the harsh nature of pre-sentence 
    custody, Arbour J. concluded at para. 41 that pre-sentence custody is &#8220;deemed 
    part of the punishment following the offender&#8217;s conviction, by the operation 
    of s. 719(3).&#8221; <i>Wust</i> also approved <i>R. v. McDonald </i>(1998), 127 
    C.C.C. (3d) 57 (Ont. C.A.), which held that the intention of Parliament was 
    met where time served together with the additional sentence would equal the 
    minimum sentence.</p>

    </span> <i>Wust </i>was revisited in <i>R. v. Fice</i>, (2005) 196 C.C.C. 
    (3d) 97 (S.C.C.),<i> </i>this time in the context of considering a conditional 
    sentence. A conditional sentence is only available if the sentence imposed 
    is less than two years. The court held that, in determining whether the sentence 
    imposed was less that two years, the trial judge ought to include time spent 
    in pre-sentence custody. In so concluding, the court said at para. 21 that 
    &#8220;the time credited to an offender for time served before sentence ought to 
    be considered part of his or her total punishment rather than as a mitigating 
    factor that can affect the range of sentence&#8221;.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Second, differences in the language of the YCJA and the Code require 
    the inclusion of pre-sentence custody in a youth sentence. While a judge sentencing 
    an adult offender has some discretion in giving credit for time served, it 
    is mandatory for a judge sentencing a young person because the YCJA uses the 
    mandatory &#8220;shall take into account&#8221; in s. 38(3)(d) as contrasted with the 
    &#8220;may take into account&#8221; in s. 719(3) of the Code. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> For these two reasons, a sentence under s. 38 includes pre-sentence 
    custody and a trial judge must deduct a young person&#8217;s pre-sentence custody 
    from the sentence that otherwise would have been pronounced.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In this case, the trial judge recognized the need to give credit for 
    pre-sentence custody and did so in the manner I reviewed earlier. This resulted 
    in an effective sentence of thirty-nine months.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:

    </span> On its face, this sentence exceeds the maximum sentence available

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The Crown argues, however, that the sentence &#8220;imposed&#8221; on the appellant 
    was only thirty-three months and that pre-sentence custody cannot be included 
    as part of the sentence &#8220;imposed&#8221;. I do not agree. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Since a sentence includes the punishment served both before and after 
    sentencing, time served is a component of the offender&#8217;s overall custodial 
    sentence. This is consistent with <i>Fice</i>, <i>supra</i>, which said<i> 
    </i>at para. 21: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Treating pre-sentence custody as part of the total 
    punishment imposed also accords with the fact that, for purposes of precedent, 
    the respondent&#8217;s &#8220;sentence&#8221; for the offence she committed will generally be 
    understood to be the global sum of 50 months, rather than the 14 months actually 
    imposed by the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Similarly, in considering young offender sentences, the Manitoba Court 
    of Appeal looked at sentences for adult offenders, noting &#8220;an adult will not, 
    barring unusual circumstances, receive the maximum penalty set out in the 
    <i>Criminal Code</i> if he or she has spent a substantial time in pretrial 
    custody&#8221;: <i>R. v. C.J.K</i>. (1994), 97 Man.R. (2d) 31 at para. 11. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Accordingly, I cannot accept the argument that time served must be 
    taken into account in determining an appropriate sentence, but must not be 
    taken into account in determining a maximum sentence. To hold otherwise would 
    create an illogical anomaly in the interpretation of the two provisions. Any 
    ambiguity in the meaning of s. 42(15) is resolved by considering it in the 
    context of s. 38(3)(<i>d</i>). This section clearly requires that pre-sentence 
    custody be taken into account. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [32]<span

    </span> In this case, the appellant argues that, for every day spent in pre-sentence 
    custody, the trial judge should give a youth a credit of either two days or 
    1.5 days. Alternatively, the appellant argues that the credit given should 
    have been deducted from the custodial portion of his sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> While the trial judge was required to give credit to the appellant 
    for pre-sentence custody, the trial judge has a residuary discretion, within 
    a certain range, to assess the quantum of credit to be given. The amount of 
    the credit will depend on a number of factors. Unless the overall sentence 
    is demonstrably unfit, this court will not interfere with the credit given 
    for pre-sentence custody absent an error in principle, a failure to consider 
    a relevant factor, or an over-emphasis of the appropriate factors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> I note that there is an exception to the requirement of one-for-one 
    credit for pre-sentence custody. A trial judge may decline to give full credit 
    where to do so would virtually exhaust the custodial term available and result 
    in a sentence contrary to the purposes of the YCJA. See <i>R. v. K.(M.)</i> 
    (1996), 107 C.C.C. (3d) 149 (Ont. C.A.). This, however, is not such a case.

    </span> Under s. 719(3) of the Code, absent unusual circumstances, trial judges 
    often credit an adult with more than one day for every day of pre-sentence

    This was, in part, because young persons were not entitled to statutory remission 
    and because young persons did not suffer the harsh conditions suffered by 
    adults in detention centres.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> However, under the YCJA, youth sentences are now comprised of two-thirds 
    custody and one-third community supervision. Thus, young persons are now in 
    a similar position to adult offenders in that time in pre-sentence custody 
    delays their eligibility for community supervision. For example, a youth sentenced 
    to nine months would serve six of those months in custody, the same amount 
    of time served by Thomas B. in this case. It is for this reason that, under 
    the YCJA, trial judges have credited a youth with 1.5 days for every day spent 
    in pre-sentence custody. On a 1.5-for-one basis, the appellant would receive 
    credit for nine months of pre-sentence custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Whether such a credit will be given in a particular case will depend 
    on more than the application of an arithmetical formula. Section 38(3) lists 
    a number of factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate 
    sentence, only one of which is pre-sentence custody. The s. 38(3) factors 
    do not attract a determination on a formulaic basis. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Thus, while a 1.5 credit may be the starting point for crediting pre-sentence 
    custody, other considerations may affect the appropriate credit. Such factors 
    may include the conditions of the youth&#8217;s pre-sentence custody, the reasons 
    for that detention, the length of the detention, the reasons for any delay 
    in reaching trial or sentencing, and the youth&#8217;s need for further custody 
    or community service to meet the purposes of the YCJA.<a

    </span> In this case, the experienced trial judge expressed his concern about 
    a 1.5 credit, which would credit &#8220;dead time for community based supervision 
    he&#8217;s never done&#8221;. In determining the appropriate sentence, the trial judge 
    took into consideration the circumstances of the offence and the offender, 
    including the offender&#8217;s record and his prospects for rehabilitation in arriving 
    at a one-for-one credit. He also took into consideration the impact of the 
    offences on the victim as well as the relatively compressed duration of the 
    maximum sentence available. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In my view, it was within the discretion of the trial judge to credit

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> On such a credit, s. 42(2)(<i>n</i>) mandates that the allocation 
    of time for a custody and supervision order be two-thirds custodial and one-third 
    community supervision. Accordingly in this case, the thirty-month sentence 
    would be served as twenty months in continued custody and ten months under 
    community supervision. The appellant argues that the six months of pre-sentence 
    custody should have been credited against the appellant&#8217;s custodial term to 
    render his sentence one of eighteen months in custody and twelve months of 
    community supervision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Whether the sentence imposed will be served in custody or out of custody 
    is not an issue either for the sentencing court or for this court. Once the 
    trial judge decided to impose a custodial term having regard to all the relevant 
    factors, including pre-sentence custody, s. 41(2)(<i>n</i>) determines what 
    part of that sentence is served in custody and what part is served out of 
    custody. </p>

    </span> This does not leave the youth without recourse. The trial judge was 
    alive to the fact that s. 94 of the YCJA provides for a mandatory review of 
    a youth sentence one year after sentencing and, after six months at the request 
    of the youth. On such a review, the court has the discretion to vary the amount 
    of time the youth will spend in closed custody, open custody, and community 
    supervision.</p>

    </span></span> The appellant takes issue with the trial judge&#8217;s decision to 
    impose a sentence at or near the maximum. As I have said, this robbery was 
    a serious offence. In all the circumstances of the offence, the offender,

    </span> The Crown concedes that the trial judge erred in ordering the appellant&#8217;s 
    probation on the trafficking charge to run concurrent to his sentence on the 
    robbery. Section 56(5) specifically provides that where, &#8220;a young person receives 
    a sentence that includes a period of continuous custody and supervision&#8221; probation 
    begins &#8220;at the end of the period of supervision&#8221;. It follows that Thomas B.&#8217;s

    </span></span> The Crown was right to make this concession. Probation following 
    the robbery sentence is not an option. A &#8220;youth sentence&#8221; is defined in s. 
    2 to include a sentence imposed under s. 42. Section 42(2)(<i>k</i>) allows 
    for the imposition of probation. Probation is, therefore, part of the sentence. 
    As the robbery sentence was already at the three-year maximum, probation was 
    precluded by s. 42(15). </p>
