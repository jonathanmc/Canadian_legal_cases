    plaintiffs, David Balac and Jennifer-Anne Cowles, for injuries resulting
    from an attack by Bengal tigers at ALS’s drive through safari zoo.  The trial

    do not accept ALS’s submissions with respect to grounds one and four. While
    I agree with ALS that the trial judge erred with respect to ground two, I
    do not think that error affected the outcome of the cases.  As to ground
    three, the trial judge did not find it necessary on the facts as she found
    them to decide whether the defence of contributory negligence applies to
    a finding of strict liability.  In the result, I would dismiss the appeals.  </p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'><u>Facts</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ALS
    operates a drive through safari zoo in Cambridge, Ontario.  The zoo is a
    popular tourist attraction which hosts thousands of visitors each year.  It
    provides its visitors with opportunities to view its animals, including lions
    and tigers, from the visitors’ own vehicles or from buses operated by ALS
    in an open environment.  In order to ensure a safe environment for its visitors
    and the animals, ALS requires that visitors keep the windows of their vehicles
    closed at all times and not feed the animals.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the afternoon of April 19, 1996, Balac and Cowles who were twenty-three and
    twenty years old, respectively, visited ALS’s zoo in Balac’s father’s 1988
    Honda Prelude.  The car was equipped with two power windows, both of which
    could be operated by buttons on the driver’s side.  When Balac drove into
    the Carnivore Section of the zoo where the attack occurred, both windows
    were fully closed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly
    afterwards, a Bengal tiger named PACA got into the Balac car through the
    passenger-side window, which was lowered before or during the time that PACA
    came into physical contact with the car.  Around the same time, the driver’s
    side window was also lowered enabling two other tigers to gain partial access
    to the interior of the car.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    tigers mauled Balac and Cowles, inflicting serious injuries.  Eventually,
    an ALS employee drove the animals away from the car by circling it in an
    ALS truck.  </p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'><u>The Trial Judge’s Reasons</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found ALS liable to Balac and Cowles on two bases.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the trial judge found that ALS, as the keeper of wild and vicious animals,
    was strictly liable for damages caused by those animals, regardless of fault. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ALS
    does not argue that the trial judge erred in concluding that the doctrine
    of strict liability applied to the facts of these cases.  It argues only
    that the trial judge erred in holding that the defence of contributory negligence
    did not apply to a finding of strict liability.  I discuss that issue under
    ground three below. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    an alternative, the trial judge also found that ALS was liable to Balac and
    Cowles in negligence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    particular, the trial judge found that ALS owed Balac and Cowles a duty of
    care and that it breached that duty in three ways.  First, an ALS employee
    had removed a tiger cub from the Carnivore Section of the zoo shortly before
    PACA attacked the Balac car.  In doing so, the employee drove in the vicinity
    of adult tigers with the cub in her vehicle.  This would likely have excited
    or upset the adult tigers and may have provoked the attack, as the ALS truck
    and the Balac car were similar in colour.  An expert called by the plaintiffs
    suggested, “[N]othing could be more calculated to excite attention and/or
    attack in a drive through facility than having another animal in one’s vehicle.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the trial judge found that another ALS employee was negligent in failing
    to pay sufficient attention to the Balac car and PACA after the car entered
    the Carnivore Section.  In particular, the employee failed to keep the passenger
    side of the car and PACA within her sight.  The employee’s actions breached
    an ALS guideline requiring her to monitor a collection of big cats in a manner
    that permitted the public to safely view them and to “keep cats away from
    visitors’ vehicles”.  The plaintiffs’ expert described the employee’s actions
    as “a monumental and fundamental error of judgment”.  The trial judge characterized
    it as negligence in the extreme.  As events turned out, the employee was
    not immediately aware of the attack and did not respond to drive the tigers
    away from the car as soon as she could have.  The trial judge concluded that,
    had the employee been more vigilant, Balac and Cowles might not have suffered
    injury.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge found fault with the way ALS had designed the zoo and trained
    its employees.  She found that ALS’s actions fell below the reasonable standards
    of care to be expected of exhibitors of dangerous animals such as those at
    the ALS zoo, and thus constituted negligence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this appeal, ALS does not challenge the trial judge’s findings of negligence.  Indeed,
    there was ample expert evidence to support each of the trial judge’s conclusions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    of the central factual issues at trial was how the windows of the Balac car
    were lowered, permitting the tigers entry.  ALS took the position that Cowles
    had lowered the passenger window intentionally in order to take a picture
    of PACA with her camera or possibly to feed a tiger.  In fact, Cowles did
    take a picture of PACA shortly before the attack.  However, it could not
    be determined from the developed photograph whether it was taken through
    the car window or not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Balac
    and Cowles both testified that they did not know how the windows came down.  They
    said that they did not intentionally lower the windows and Cowles specifically
    said that she did not open the passenger window to take a picture or to feed
    a tiger.  Cowles testified that she took the picture of PACA through her
    closed passenger-side window.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge accepted the evidence of Balac and Cowles.  She said at para.
    16 of her judgment:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I was impressed
    by both Jennifer and David as they gave their evidence, they were excellent
    witnesses in my experience.  They were both on the stand for a number of
    days and were both closely and vigorously cross-examined – neither wavered.  I
    thought they were both forthright and did not see any tendency to overstate
    or exaggerate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later
    in her reasons, at para. 53, the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>David and Jennifer
    have, I find, been consistent from the day of the attack and repeated over
    and over that they do not know how the window came down and they deny that
    Jennifer’s window was opened so she could take photographs and I accept their
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    were strong findings of credibility.  Significantly, ALS, on this appeal,
    does not challenge the trial judge’s findings in this respect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    found that Balac and Cowles did not intentionally lower the windows, the
    trial judge went on to consider how the windows could have come down.  The
    parties put forward a number of explanations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that the only reasonable explanation on the facts was
    that when PACA made her initial attack on the passenger side of the vehicle,
    the window was closed.  PACA attacked the car, causing it to rock.  Balac’s
    foot then slipped off the clutch, stalling the car.  Probably, at the same
    time, Balac’s arm or some other part of his body inadvertently came into
    contact with the automatic window switches on the driver’s side, lowering
    the windows on both sides of the vehicle and allowing the tigers access to
    the passengers.  The trial judge said at para. 21 that this was “the most
    reasonable explanation for what occurred and it accord[ed] with the evidence
    which [she] accept[ed]”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    reaching this conclusion, the trial judge relied on expert evidence concerning
    the damage done to the car and the operation of the car’s automatic windows.  On
    this appeal, ALS argues that, in considering the evidence about how the windows
    could have been lowered, the trial judge misapprehended or ignored certain
    evidence.  I disagree with this submission and I deal with this argument
    under ground number four below.  I note here, however, that this is the only
    basis upon which ALS attacks the findings of fact made by the trial judge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    in her reasons, the trial judge rejected the evidence of five witnesses who
    testified about statements allegedly made by Balac or Cowles about how the
    attacks occurred.  The alleged statements suggested that Cowles had intentionally
    lowered the passenger window in order to take a photograph of or to feed
    a tiger.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge carefully analyzed the circumstances surrounding each of these
    alleged statements and found that there were significant problems with each.  The
    statements were not consistent with one another and, in some instances, were
    inconsistent with the undisputed factual evidence about what in fact happened
    or with what the witness had said on other occasions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ALS
    does not argue on this appeal that the trial judge erred in rejecting the
    evidence relating to the alleged statements.  </p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'><u>Ground #One – Striking the Jury Notice</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge erred in striking the jury notice that
    it had served in accordance with the rules and in proceeding with the trial
    without a jury.</p>

    O.J. No. 4534 at para. 29 (S.C.J.), the trial judge began her reasons for
    striking the jury notice by quoting from this court’s decision in <i>Graham

    the parties will be better served by the discharge or retention of the jury.</u> The
    moving party bears the burden of persuasion and must be able to point to

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge continued at paras. 30 to 34 as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[30] In my view
    the complexities which arise in these cases and which I have detailed above
    cause me to conclude that <i>justice to the parties will be better served
    if the jury notice is struck out</i> and these matters proceed before me
    alone.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[31] The legal
    liability arguments are complex, whether the doctrine of strict liability
    applies on the facts of this case is at best a question of mixed fact and
    law.&nbsp; Further there is disagreement about whether strict liability admits
    of any defence.&nbsp; The alternative ground of negligence advanced here
    clearly admits the defence of contributory negligence.&nbsp; It may be difficult
    for a lay jury to keep the concepts separate.&nbsp; There is disputed expert
    evidence on the liability aspects outlined earlier in these reasons and the
    medical evidence will be detailed, lengthy and complex and may even be disputed
    in some respects, I am told that ALS has delivered two defence medical reports – but
    even absent any dispute – the evidence remains detailed and complex.&nbsp; The
    actuarial evidence, which is never easy, is even more difficult where a plaintiff
    is at a stage in life where he/she has not moved yet into a permanent vocation
    where there is some reliable indicator of income potential.&nbsp; Of necessity
    streams of income from a number of scenarios are usually considered when
    these sorts of claims are made.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[32] These and
    the other complexities outlined cause me to believe that justice requires
    these matters be tried without a jury.&nbsp; While each of the factors I
    have outlined may – alone – not be sufficient, when considered cumulatively
    together with the fact that counsel conservatively estimate that the trial
    will take six weeks there really in my view is little choice.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[33] Mr. Wright
    suggests we take a wait and see attitude.&nbsp; He says that perhaps as the
    evidence unfolds the issues may become less complex.&nbsp; I must respectfully
    disagree with his submission.&nbsp; All of the evidentiary complexities I
    have outlined to this point in time are the reality now.&nbsp; They are not
    merely possibilities which <u>may</u> arise in the future; they arise by
    reason of the very nature of the actions themselves.&nbsp; While I appreciate
    there are times where it is preferable to take a wait and see approach in
    my view, this is not one of those cases.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[34] In addition
    to these complexities, when I consider the number of counsel involved on
    behalf of the primary plaintiffs in their various capacities and the difficulty
    of explaining that to a jury let alone having them comprehend it, I am more
    convinced that it is appropriate here to strike the jury notices and I so
    order [underline in original, italics added].</p>

    the damages assessed, or both, by a jury, except when the relief sought falls

    is worth noting that the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> and the rules provide
    very little guidance with respect to the manner in which judges should exercise
    their discretions to dispense with a jury.  As I discuss below, over time
    courts in Ontario have developed a test for what is considered to be “a proper
    case” to try an action without a jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is settled law that the right to trial by jury in a civil case is a substantive
    right and should not be interfered with without just cause or cogent reasons:  <i>King

    party moving to strike a jury bears the onus of showing that there are features
    in the legal or factual issues to be resolved, in the evidence, or in the
    conduct of the trial which merit the discharge of the jury.  In the end,
    a court must decide whether the moving party has shown that justice to the
    parties will be better served by the discharge of the jury:  <i>Graham</i>, <i>supra</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    that test confers a rather broad discretion on a court confronted with such
    a motion, it is nonetheless a sensible test.  After all, the object of a
    civil trial is to provide justice between the parties, nothing more.  It
    makes sense that neither party should have an unfettered right to determine
    the mode of trial.  Rather, the court, which plays the role of impartial
    arbiter, should, when a disagreement arises, have the power to determine
    whether justice to the parties will be better served by trying a case with
    or without a jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application of this test should not diminish the important role that juries
    play in the administration of civil justice.  Experience shows that juries
    are able to deal with a wide variety of cases and to render fair and just
    results.  The test, however, recognizes that the paramount objective of the
    civil justice system is to provide the means by which a dispute between parties
    can be resolved in the most just manner possible.  </p>

    review of a trial court’s exercise of its discretion to dispense with a jury
    is limited.  In <i>Kostopoulos v. Jesshope </i>(1985), 50 O.R. (2d) 54 at
    69-70 (C.A.), Robins J.A. set out the well accepted standard for appellate
    review as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I think it manifest
    from the authorities that before an appellate court may properly intervene
    it must be shown that the discretion was exercised arbitrarily or capriciously
    or was based upon a wrong or inapplicable principle of law.  The question
    to be addressed in this case is whether the trial judge committed an error
    of such a nature.  If not, this Court is not entitled to interfere with his
    exercise of the discretionary power conferred by s. 60(3) [of the <i>Judicature
    Act</i>].  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appellate
    deference for the exercise of discretion by lower courts is justified on
    several bases:  it serves to recognize the expertise of the lower court;
    it promotes the integrity and autonomy of the proceedings in the lower court;
    it limits the number, length and costs of appeals; and, in some cases (not
    this one), it recognizes the advantage that the lower courts have from firsthand
    observation of the evidence.  See <i>Housen v. Nikolaisen</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R.
    235; see also Roger P. Kerans, <i>Standards of Review Employed by Appellate

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    appeal court should not interfere with the exercise of a trial court’s discretion
    simply because it disagrees with the conclusion reached.  That means an appeal
    court should not merely pay lip service to the concept of deference and then
    proceed to substitute its own view as to what the proper result should be
    for that of the lower court.  Interference is only justified when the lower
    court is shown to have committed the type of error referred to in <i>Kostopoulos</i>.</p>

    is not argued, nor could it be, that the trial judge acted arbitrarily or
    capriciously.  She heard the motion to strike the jury notice on November
    1, 2004.  The parties presented a substantial amount of evidence by way of
    affidavits with several exhibits attached, including copies of some of the
    expert reports upon which they intended to rely at trial.  The parties made
    detailed submissions.  The trial judge took the matter under consideration
    and delivered her decision, providing reasons three days later.  It is apparent
    from her reasons that she had reviewed the evidence that had been filed on
    the motion and that she had considered the submissions of the parties.  </p>

    principles of law applicable to a motion to strike a jury notice.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

    quoting the test set out in <i>Graham</i>, <i>supra</i> – whether justice

line-height:normal'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Clearly,
    the complexity of a case is a proper consideration in determining whether
    a jury notice should be struck.  Indeed, a review of the case law indicates
    that the complexity of a case is by far the most common reason why courts
    dispense with juries in civil cases, the rationale being that a judge, because
    of his or her legal training and experience, may be better able to render
    justice in a case that is complex.  Where one draws the line as to when a
    particular case would be better heard by a judge sitting alone is far from
    an exact science.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    consideration of the complexity of a case relates not only to the facts and
    the evidence, but also to the legal principles that apply to the case.  While
    it is the trial judge who is responsible for determining questions of law
    and instructing a jury on the appropriate legal principles, it is the jurors
    who must decide whether and how those principles apply to the facts as they
    find them on the evidence.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jury’s task in applying the law to the facts may be more or less complex
    depending on the issues in a particular case.  The point is, however, that
    in looking at the complexity of the case insofar as it may affect a jury,
    it is proper for a judge to consider the complexity of the factual as well
    as the legal issues, bearing in mind the jury’s particular role with regard
    to the latter.  </p>

    factual and evidentiary, in approaching the question of whether she should
    strike the jury notice.  </p>

    fact that a trial judge considers that the complexity of a case warrants
    dispensing with a jury is not, in itself, sufficient to insulate the exercise
    of that discretion from appellate interference.  The test is whether there
    were cogent reasons for the exercise of the discretion, <i>King</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    or, as I would word it, was there a reasonable basis for the trial judge’s
    exercise of discretion?  If the circumstances are such that there was no
    reasonable basis for the conclusion reached, then the trial judge will have
    made a reversible error.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her reasons, the trial judge pointed out that her conclusion was based on
    the cumulative effect of a number of factors.  She considered the legal,
    factual and evidentiary complexities of the cases.  While she did not appear
    to attach great weight to the legal complexity of the cases, she pointed
    out that there were two alternative causes of action, strict liability and
    negligence, and that there were potentially a number of defences available. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge attached considerable importance to the factual and evidentiary
    complexities of the cases.  There was going to be disputed expert evidence

    through safari zoo and the mechanics of automobile power windows.</p>

line-height:normal'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    she indicated that the damages issues were going to be very complex.  The
    plaintiffs had suffered serious personal injuries and, during the argument
    of the motion, the parties indicated that there would be eighteen to twenty
    medical witnesses called.  The trial judge had before her lengthy and complicated
    medical reports, including reports from plastic surgeons, orthopaedic surgeons,
    psychiatrists, psychologists and rehabilitation and clinical neuro-psychologists.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, it was anticipated that the actuarial evidence relating to the
    income potential for both plaintiffs would be more difficult than in many
    cases.  Because the plaintiffs had not yet embarked upon permanent occupations,
    it would be necessary to consider potential income streams from a number
    of different scenarios.  Finally, the trial judge observed that the trial
    would be lengthy, as counsel conservatively estimated it would last six weeks.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Looking
    at all of the factors considered by the trial judge, I am satisfied that
    there was sufficient complexity to form a basis for her to conclude that
    justice to the parties would be better served if she tried the case without
    a jury.  I must say that I find this case to fall at the low end of the complexity
    scale that would permit a judge to dispense with a jury.  It is likely that
    some judges confronted with the same factors would exercise their discretion
    differently.  That said, I do not think that it can be said that there was
    no reasonable basis for the trial judge’s conclusion that the complexity
    of the cases warranted striking the jury notice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    has been suggested that, when weighing the issue of complexity, regard should
    be had to the fact that over the years juries in criminal trials have decided
    some very complex and lengthy trials, some exceeding a year in length.  The
    suggestion is that if juries are able to manage lengthy and complex criminal
    trials, then the same should hold true for civil cases.  I do not think that
    the comparison to criminal cases is particularly helpful.  As Reid J. pointed
    out in <i>Rahmaty v. Kentner</i>, [1982] O.J. No. 2284 (H.C.J.), the problem
    with this suggestion is that it ignores the fact that in criminal cases there
    is no room for the exercise of a judge’s discretion with respect to whether
    a case would be better tried with or without a jury.  Factors that are absent
    in disputes between private litigants come into play in criminal trials.  Accused
    persons have an absolute right to be tried by a jury when charged with specified
    offences.  As such, juries must deal with some criminal trials no matter
    how complex and no matter what a judge may consider to be the best way to
    achieve justice in the particular case.  The same is not true for civil cases.  While
    parties in civil cases have a substantive right to a jury trial if they choose,
    courts are given a discretion to try a case without a jury “in a proper case”.</p>

line-height:normal'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the appellant argues that the trial judge erred in the way she approached
    the legal complexity of the case.  For convenience, I repeat what the trial
    judge said in her November 4, 2004 ruling at para. 31 about legal complexity:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The legal liability
    arguments are complex, whether the doctrine of strict liability applies on
    the facts of this case is at best a question of mixed fact and law.  Further,
    there is disagreement about whether strict liability admits of any defence.  The
    alternative ground of negligence advanced here clearly admits the defence
    of contributory negligence.  <i>It may be difficult for a lay jury to keep
    the concepts separate</i> [emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    start, I reject any suggestion that the trial judge was operating under the
    misapprehension that a jury would be required to decide legal issues or to
    determine the legal principles that would be applied to the case.  Had she
    made that error, there would, of course, be a basis for this court to interfere:
    see <i>Cosford v. Cornwall</i> (1992), 9 O.R. (3d) 37 (C.A.).  While the
    trial judge expressed a concern about the complexity of the legal issues
    in her reasons, I read her comments in this regard as suggesting that the
    jury may have difficulty in applying the legal concepts as instructed by
    her, not in deciding what those concepts were.  This, it seems to me, is
    apparent from her last comment – “It may be difficult for a lay jury to keep
    the concepts separate”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is nothing in the trial judge’s reasons to suggest that she did not understand
    that she was responsible for deciding questions of law and, on the basis
    of her decisions, instructing the jurors who would then be required to apply
    the law to the facts as they found them.  Indeed, it seems most unlikely
    to me that this experienced trial judge, who no doubt had conducted many
    dozens of jury trials over the years, would have misunderstood the respective
    roles of a trial judge and a jury.  </p>

    also do not accept the suggestion that the trial judge was motivated to strike
    the jury notice, even in part, on the basis that it would be difficult for
    her to explain the law to the jury.  Again, it would be reversible error
    to strike a jury notice on this basis, as trial judges are presumed to know
    the law and to be able to explain it to a jury:  <i>Hunt (Litigation Guardian

    her reasons, the trial judge referred to the differing positions of the parties
    as to whether any defences were available when the doctrine of strict liability
    applies.  However, she did not relate that observation to any difficulty
    she might have in explaining the law as she would determine it.  Rather,
    I interpret her reasons, somewhat brief in this regard, as saying that, depending
    on her decision, it may be necessary for her to instruct the jury on defences
    for strict liability with the result that there would be more issues for
    the jury to address.</p>

    appellant argues that the trial judge erred in characterizing the legal liability
    issues as complex and, in particular, in indicating that the issue of whether
    the doctrine of strict liability applied to the facts was “at best a question
    of mixed fact and law”.  The appellant points out that this court, in <i>Hunt</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    emphasized that an issue that is one of mixed fact and law is not necessarily
    complex.</p>

    the court in <i>Hunt</i> did not say that issues of mixed fact and law may
    never be complex.  Obviously, in some cases they can be very complex.  The
    court said only that they are not necessarily so.  Moreover, the court in <i>Hunt</i> did
    not reverse the trial judge’s decision to dismiss the jury on the basis that
    the trial judge had referred to questions of mixed fact and law as being
    complex.  The court interfered because the trial judge had erred in considering
    the length of time it would take to prepare a charge to the jury, in failing
    to consider splitting the trial between liability and damages as he had been
    asked to do, and in giving weight to the difficulty he would have in instructing
    the jury as to the law.  None of those errors are present here.</p>

    looked at the legal complexities of the cases insofar as they might affect
    the jury, the trial judge concluded only that the jury may have difficulty
    keeping the legal concepts separate.  She did not appear to attach a great
    deal of weight to the legal complexity aspect of the cases.  In any event,
    even if this court were to disagree with the trial judge’s assessment that,
    from a legal issue standpoint, the cases may be difficult for a jury, that
    disagreement in the context of the trial judge’s overall reasons would not,
    in my view, constitute the type of legal error that warrants appellate intervention.</p>

    appellant’s second argument is that the trial judge erred in failing to take
    a “wait and see” approach to the motion to strike the jury notice.  In its
    submissions to the trial judge, the appellant urged her to reserve her decision
    until after the evidence had been completed, or at least a portion of it
    had been completed, arguing that the issues may become less complex as the
    evidence unfolded.  The trial judge declined to take such an approach and
    set out her reasons at para. 33 of her ruling:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>All of the evidentiary
    complexities I have outlined to this point in time are the reality now.  They
    are not merely possibilities which <u>may</u> arise in the future; they arise
    by reason of the very nature of the actions themselves.  While I appreciate
    there are times where it is preferable to take a wait and see approach in
    my view, this is not one of those cases [emphasis in original].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Over
    the years, courts have said that, in some cases, when confronted with a motion
    to strike a jury notice or discharge a jury, it is preferable to proceed
    with the trial and wait until the evidence or a substantial portion of it
    has been heard before deciding whether the discharge of the jury is warranted.  Experience
    has shown that in many instances the anticipated complexities of a case or
    other concerns giving rise to a motion to dismiss a jury do not materialize
    or at least not to the extent originally asserted.  By “waiting and seeing”,
    courts are better able to protect the substantive right of the party who
    wants a jury trial and to only dismiss the jury when it becomes necessary
    to do so:  see e.g. <i>Martin v. St. Lawrence Cement Co. et al., </i>[1968]
    1 O.R. 94 (C.A.); <i>Ryan v. Whitton</i>, [1964] 1 O.R. 111 (C.A.).</p>

line-height:normal'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Obviously,
    there is merit to taking a “wait and see” approach in some cases, and perhaps
    in most.  However, taking such an approach is not a rule of law. The <i>Courts
    of Justice Act</i> and the rules contemplate that a judge may strike a jury
    notice even before a trial has begun and that a trial judge may dismiss a
    jury before beginning to hear the evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    trial judge has a discretion whether or not to take a wait and see approach.  In
    many cases it is the most prudent course to follow.  In some cases, however,
    trial judges will consider that there is no advantage to beginning the trial
    with the jury because the situation as presented at the outset makes it apparent
    that the case should not be tried with a jury.  There is thus no point to
    waiting and seeing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge in this case was well aware that taking a wait and see approach
    was a preferable course in some cases, but in exercising her discretion she
    considered that the case before her was not one of those cases.  As she saw
    it, the evidentiary complexities were the reality at the time of the motion
    and those complexities arose because of the nature of the actions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    support of its argument that the trial judge should have adopted a wait and
    see approach, the appellant points to the fact that at the trial, as events
    turned out, only five doctors were called with respect to damages, not the
    eighteen to twenty that had been forecasted at the time of the motion.  Had
    the trial judge waited before striking the jury notice, she would have been
    aware of this change of circumstance and it may have affected the way in
    which she exercised her discretion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    is possible. However, it is important to look at what happened after the
    trial was underway.  During the course of the trial, both plaintiffs, Cowles
    and Balac, settled their non-pecuniary damages claims.  Those settlements,
    no doubt, made it possible to proceed with considerably fewer medical witnesses
    than would have otherwise been the case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is always possible that a case or some issues in a case will settle during
    the course of a trial.  When that happens, the complexity of the proceedings
    may well be reduced.  While a trial judge may wish to consider the possibility
    of settlement as one of the factors in determining whether to dispense with
    the jury at the outset of the trial, I do not think that a trial judge who
    strikes a jury notice or discharges a jury makes an error in law because
    of a failure to “wait and see” if the case might be simplified by settlement
    during the course of the trial.  Were it otherwise, trial judges would never
    dispense with a jury before a case was completed because only then would
    it be known for sure whether the case or some issues in the case would be
    settled.  The <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, the rules and the case law do
    not restrict a trial court’s discretion to dispense with a jury in this manner.  Courts
    have the authority to dispense with a jury even before a trial begins.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the fact that fewer medical witnesses were called at the trial than were
    anticipated at the time of the motion likely related, at least in part, to
    the fact that when a trial proceeds before a judge alone, the parties are
    often able to abbreviate the evidence and limit the number of witnesses to
    be called.  It is well recognized that the conduct of a jury trial is significantly
    different and typically takes longer than the same trial before a judge sitting
    without a jury.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, there is little to be gained in this case in reviewing the trial
    judge’s decision to strike the jury notice by using hindsight and looking
    back on what actually happened at the trial after it proceeded without a
    jury.  The trial judge assessed the case as being complex when it was put
    to her by the parties at the time of the motion.  She considered the wait
    and see approach, determined that the complexities as she saw them at that
    time were the reality, and exercised her discretion against adopting that
    approach.  She considered the appropriate factors and, even if one were to
    disagree with the approach she adopted, it was reasonable and properly fell
    within her discretion to proceed as she did.  I see no error that would constitute
    the use of a wrong or inapplicable principle of law and thus no basis to
    interfere with the trial judge’s decision not to take a “wait and see”
    approach.</p>

    third error alleged by the appellant is that, in reaching her decision, the

    the time of the motion, counsel estimated that the trial would last six weeks.  The
    trial judge characterized this estimate as conservative, correctly, I suggest.
    The actual trial lasted twenty-six days.  However, the circumstances as they
    existed at the time of the motion pointed to a much longer trial.  As indicated
    above, the plaintiffs’ non-pecuniary damages claims were settled during the
    trial.  Had the trial proceeded before a jury as anticipated at the time
    of the motion, it likely would have taken much longer than six weeks.</p>

    fact that a jury trial might last for a lengthy period of time is not, in
    itself, a reason to strike a jury notice or dismiss a jury.  However, the
    length of a trial may be one indicator of the complexity of a case.  It seems
    logical that a longer trial with more witnesses and probably more issues
    will, in many cases, be more complex.</p>

    the trial judge’s comment about the anticipated length of the trial was linked
    to her conclusions about the complexity of the cases.  Her point, as I understand
    it, was that these were complex and difficult cases which were going to last
    for a considerable period of time.  </p>

    the fact that Balac and Cowles were represented by two sets of counsel in

    no role in the development of the evidence.</p>

    by a judge in deciding whether or not to dispense with a jury.  Be that as
    it may, the trial judge’s comment about this anticipated difficulty was not
    integral to her decision to strike the jury notice.  She based her decision
    on the other factors that I have mentioned above and only referred to the

    which the trial judge’s failure to consider splitting the case was one of
    the factors on which this court relied to set aside the trial judge’s decision
    to discharge the jury.  In <i>Hunt</i>, however, defence counsel had expressly
    asked the trial judge to consider that option and, significantly, the trial
    judge made no mention whatsoever of the defendant’s request or arguments
    in this respect.  The trial judge appeared not to address the argument at

    summary, I am satisfied that the trial judge acted within the ambit of her
    discretion in striking the jury notice.  Although some judges might have
    exercised that discretion differently, that does not constitute a basis for
    appellate intervention.  Cases such as these come down to weighing the right
    of the litigant to a jury trial against a determination that justice to the
    parties will be better served by striking the jury notice.  In cases where
    a party seeks to strike a jury notice on the basis of complexity, the question
    will generally become one of degree.  A judge hearing a motion must consider
    whether the degree of complication or difficulty is such that the notice
    should be struck.  The answer to the question of whether justice to the parties
    will be better served by striking a jury notice is not always clear.  As
    Doherty J.A. said in <i>Graham</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 625:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A trial judge

    I note that in <i>King</i>, <i>supra</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada held
    that one element of the test for appellate interference in a trial court’s
    decision to dispense with a jury is that the appeal court must determine
    that the result of the trial would not necessarily have been the same had
    there been a trial with a jury. A consideration of the merits of the case
    arises, however, only if the appeal court determines that the trial court’s
    discretion was exercised capriciously, arbitrarily, or was based on a wrong
    or inapplicable principle of law.  Given that I do not find that the trial
    judge made such an error in this case, it is not necessary to consider the
    merits of the cases in relation to this ground of appeal. </p>

    appellant argues that the trial judge erred in holding that the defence of
    contributory negligence did not apply to a finding of strict liability.  In
    her reasons for judgment, the trial judge discussed this issue at some length
    and seemed to conclude that the defence was not available.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    in the end, the trial judge did not find it necessary, on the facts as she
    found them, to decide the legal issue.  At para. 140 of her reasons for judgment,
    she said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In any event,
    I have found that the injuries to and the damages suffered by both plaintiffs
    resulted from the unprovoked attack on their vehicle by the tiger PACA.  That
    forceful assault on the vehicle caused Mr. Balac’s body to inadvertently
    come into contact with the window switch resulting in the lowering of the
    windows on the vehicle which admitted the tiger into the vehicle.  There
    was no conduct, in my view, on the part of either David or Jennifer which
    would constitute contributory negligence on their part even if such defence
    were available.  Their windows were up when they entered the Carnivore Section
    and were not deliberately put down for any purpose while in that Section
    before the attack, by either of them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge misapprehended or ignored certain evidence
    in reaching the conclusions that the windows of the car were up when PACA
    first attacked and that the attack caused Balac’s arm or some other part
    of his body to inadvertently come into contact with the window switches,
    thereby lowering both windows.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is important to position the appellant’s challenge to the trial judge’s findings
    of fact in the context of her overall reasons.  The trial judge found that
    the appellant was strictly liable and was also liable in negligence to Balac
    and Cowles for the injuries they suffered.  The appellant does not challenge
    those findings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    the factual issues of when and how the windows were lowered are only relevant
    to the possible defence of contributory negligence to the findings of liability. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge began her analysis of these issues by considering the only direct
    evidence available – the testimony of Balac and Cowles.  They testified that
    they did not intentionally lower the windows.  Cowles specifically testified
    that she did not lower the passenger-side window to take a picture of PACA.  Although
    Balac and Cowles could not say when and how the windows were lowered, the
    most logical inference from their evidence was that the windows were up when
    the tiger attacked.  The trial judge found Balac and Cowles  to be credible
    witnesses and accepted their evidence.  The appellant does not challenge
    the trial judge’s findings in this regard.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the trial judge concluded that Balac and Cowles did not intentionally lower
    the windows, she went on to consider what explanation or explanations there
    could be as to how the windows were lowered that would be consistent with
    the evidence that she had accepted.  It was in the course of this analysis
    that the appellant submits that the trial judge made reversible errors in
    her fact-finding process.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Significantly,
    the appellant accepts that the trial judge’s conclusion that Balac inadvertently
    pressed the down on the window buttons was not a physical impossibility.  In
    other words, the appellant concedes that the events could have happened in
    the way that the trial judge found to be a reasonable explanation of what
    did in fact occur.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the appellant argues that the trial judge erred in relying on evidence of
    the plaintiffs’ expert, Mr. Leier, who testified that the damage to the passenger-side
    door indicated there had been a repeated vigorous striking of the vehicle
    by a large animal trying to gain entry when the passenger window was up.  The
    appellant argues that the trial judge erred in relying on this evidence because
    Balac and Cowles had not testified that the tiger “repeatedly” struck the
    car.  Balac’s evidence was that when PACA attacked, the car rocked violently
    and his foot slipped off the clutch.  However, he said that there was only
    one rocking.  Cowles testified about hearing a “bang-like noise”.  The appellant
    also argues that the tiger could have damaged the door while the window was
    partially opened, the latter fact being conceded by Mr. Leier.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I understand it, the appellant’s purpose in making these submissions is to
    make the point that the physical damage to the car was consistent not only
    with the explanation that the passenger-side window was fully up at the start
    of the attack, but also with an explanation that it could have been partially
    open.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accepting
    that both explanations are possible, I fail to see how that helps the appellant
    on this appeal.  The explanation that the window was up when the tiger first
    attacked is still consistent with the evidence of Balac and Cowles.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the evidence is clear that the car rocked violently at least once, that Balac’s
    foot slipped, and the car stalled.  That evidence provides the basis for
    the explanation as to how Balac inadvertently came into contact with the
    window buttons.  It seems to me that once the trial judge accepted the evidence
    of Balac and Cowles, her finding of how the windows came down was, as she
    put it, “the most reasonable explanation” for what had occurred.  The fact
    that there could be another explanation does not undermine the trial judge’s
    conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also argues that the trial judge erred in ignoring the evidence
    that the window could only be lowered by the application of four seconds
    of pressure to the switch unless the tiger accelerated the movement, a fact
    the trial judge did not expressly find to be the case.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept this submission.  Balac testified that the window came down
    in milliseconds and, at para. 11 of her reasons for judgment, the trial judge
    referred to Balac’s evidence as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[A]s he faced
    forward, out of the corner of his eye he noticed a paw and at about the same
    time the window moved down quickly with the paw.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    fair reading of the trial judge’s reasons indicates that she found that when
    Balac inadvertently hit the window switches, the tiger’s paw was almost immediately
    put on the window, which accelerated the downward movement of the window.
    The trial judge did not ignore the evidence with respect to the time required
    to lower the window, absent pressure.  I see no error in this regard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellant argues that the trial judge in her reasons failed to address
    the evidence that, although there was mud on the passenger-side door, there
    was no mud on the window – the suggestion being that if the window was up
    when the tiger attacked there would have been mud on it.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    trial judge’s failure to refer to a specific piece of evidence does not <i>per
    se</i> constitute palpable and overriding error.  It is only when an omission
    gives rise to a reasonable belief that the trial judge must have forgotten,
    ignored or misconceived the evidence in a way that affected her conclusion
    that an appellate court is entitled is intervene:  <i>Housen</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at para. 72.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is not argued nor could it be that the lack of mud on the passenger-side
    window necessarily leads to a conclusion that the window was down when the
    tiger first attacked.  While that is one possibility, there are other explanations
    about the lack of mud on the window that are consistent with the window being
    up.  The fact is that no one knows for sure exactly what happened. However,
    none of the physical evidence, including the lack of mud on the passenger-side
    window, is inconsistent with the evidence that the trial judge accepted.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the trial judge’s conclusion as to how the attack most likely occurred
    is entirely consistent with the physical evidence.  I do not accept that
    she misapprehended evidence or ignored relevant evidence in reaching that
    conclusion.  Thus, I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>

    Cowles and David Balac, and related <i>Family Law Act</i> claimants for bodily
    injuries sustained by Cowles and Balac caused by tigers owned by ALS at the
    premises of ALS.  The trial judge awarded damages of approximately $1,700,000
    to Balac and $800,000 to Cowles.  Although ALS had delivered a jury notice,
    the trial judge struck out the jury before the opening of trial.  In its
    principal ground of appeal, ALS contends that the trial judge erred in doing
    so, and seeks a new trial on the issues of liability and contributory negligence.  For

    so while driving through the zoo in their own motor vehicles, or while riding

    with two front&#8209;seat power windows.  Balac was driving the car.  Cowles
    was sitting in the passenger seat taking pictures of the tigers.  It was
    the contention of ALS that at, or shortly after, the time that Cowles was
    taking a picture of a tiger called Paca, the tiger entered the car through
    the passenger’s window that was lowered before, or during, the time that
    Paca came into physical contact with the car.  During the chaos that followed,
    the driver’s window was somehow lowered, enabling two other tigers to gain
    partial access to the interior of the car.  The plaintiffs’ contention was
    that the windows were always closed and that they were opened accidentally.  Balac
    and Cowles were mauled by the tigers, causing them serious injuries.</p>

    by dangerous animals, negligence and breach of the <i>Occupiers’ Liability
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;O.2.  The action against the Balacs is based
    on negligence, it being alleged that Balac opened the passenger’s window
    enabling the tiger to gain access to the car.  In his statement of defence
    and counterclaim against Cowles, Balac alleged that Cowles opened the passenger’s
    window and was

    I will return to this subject, it is important to note that in this case
    there was only one significant factual issue.  It was how the car’s windows
    came to be open, permitting the tigers to enter the car.  The plaintiffs
    and the defendant each submitted expert evidence on the operation of the
    Honda’s power windows.  Cowles testified that she had not opened the passenger’s
    window to take pictures of the tigers.  It was common ground that for the
    tigers to enter the car, its windows on the driver’s side and the passenger’s
    side had to have been open.  However, there was considerable evidence that
    contradicted Cowles’ testimony.  An ALS employee testified that when he approached
    the car Balac was scolding Cowles for opening the window and feeding the
    tigers after the tigers had attacked them.  Another ALS employee and two
    emergency rescue workers testified that Cowles admitted to them that she
    had lowered the passenger window to take a picture.  The hospital records
    prepared by Dr.&nbsp;Wong, the admitting emergency room physician, indicated
    that Cowles stated that she had opened the window to take a photograph.  Cowles’s
    aunt, in a statement given to an insurance adjuster, said that Cowles had
    told her that she had the window down while taking a picture of the tiger.  The

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[30] In my view
    the complexities which arise in these cases and which I have detailed above
    cause me to conclude that justice to the parties will be better served if
    the jury notice is struck out and these matters proceed before me alone.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[31] <i>The
      legal liability arguments are complex, whether the doctrine of strict liability
      applies on the facts of this case is at best a question of mixed fact and
      law.&nbsp; Further there is disagreement about whether strict liability
      admits of any defence.</i>&nbsp; The alternative ground of negligence advanced
      here clearly admits the defence of contributory negligence.&nbsp; It may
      be difficult for a lay jury to keep the concepts separate.&nbsp; <i>There
      is disputed expert evidence on the liability aspects outlined earlier in
      these reasons and the medical evidence will be detailed, lengthy and complex
      and may even be disputed in some respects</i>, I am told that ALS has delivered
      two defence medical reports – but even absent any dispute – the evidence
      remains detailed and complex.&nbsp; The actuarial evidence, which is never
      easy, is even more difficult where a plaintiff is at a stage in life where
      he/she has not moved yet into a permanent vocation where there is some
      reliable indicator of income potential.&nbsp; Of necessity streams of income
      from a number of scenarios are usually considered when these sorts of claims
      are made.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[32] These and
    the other complexities outlined cause me to believe that justice requires
    these matters be tried without a jury.&nbsp; While each of the factors I
    have outlined may – alone – not be sufficient, when considered cumulatively
    together with the fact that counsel conservatively estimate that the trial
    will take six weeks there really in my view is little choice.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[33] <i>Mr.
      Wright suggests we take a wait and see attitude.&nbsp; He says that perhaps

      complexities I have outlined to this point in time are the reality now.&nbsp;
    They are not merely possibilities which may arise in the future; they arise
    by reason of the very nature of the actions themselves.&nbsp; While I appreciate
    there are times where it is preferable to take a wait and see approach in
    my view, this is not one of those cases.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[34] In addition
    to these complexities, when I consider the number of counsel involved on

    respect to the motion to exclude the investigator’s evidence, the trial judge

    surveillance of Cowles and had conversations with her at the place of her
    employment.  At the time, Cowles was represented by counsel who had no knowledge
    of what the investigator saw and heard until disclosure took place at a pre-trial
    conference shortly before trial.  The trial judge excluded the investigator’s

    her reasons for judgment, the trial judge dealt first with the factual issue
    that was central to liability.  In doing so, she reviewed the evidence of
    Balac and Cowles in respect to what had occurred.  She accepted the evidence
    of both plaintiffs, although it appears that neither testified about whether
    the passenger’s window was up or down when Paca entered the car and attacked
    Cowles.  In para.&nbsp;18, she made her only reference to the evidence about
    the operation of the power windows given by the two engineering experts,
    Leier and Raftery.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    para.&nbsp;21, the trial judge decided the critical factual issue as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[21]     In
    my view the only reasonable explanation on the facts, is that when the tiger,
    PACA, made its initial attack on the passenger side of the vehicle, the window
    was closed.&nbsp; Had it been open then the tiger would have entered the
    car.&nbsp; It did not and this fact is evidenced by the physical damage on
    the passenger door described by Mr. Leier in his evidence.&nbsp; There were
    four primary dents at the sill level, three smaller ones toward the centre
    of the panel and two similar vertical creases at the bottom of the door.&nbsp; David
    Balac’s evidence was that this damage was <i>not</i> present on the door
    before the incident and was present when the vehicle was returned to him
    after the attack.&nbsp; His father’s evidence is to the same effect.&nbsp; Ranko
    Balac, David’s father, attended the ALS premises in the morning after the
    attack to retrieve the car.&nbsp; He noted the presence of a number of dents
    on the passenger door that had not been present the day before.&nbsp; Mr.
    Balac Sr. is a photographer on weekends; he often carries a camera with him
    and did so on this occasion.&nbsp; Exhibit 1, Tab 11 contains the photos
    taken by Mr. Balac Sr.&nbsp; Photos “A” and “B” in particular show the damage
    to the passenger door.&nbsp; Their evidence is corroborated in this respect
    by that of Steve Ashbee, head game warden of ALS then and now, who after
    the attack noted the presence of “lots of smears, scratches, and dents”
    on the passenger-side door.&nbsp; Mr. Leier’s opinion, which I accept, is
    that this damage was <i>NOT</i> consistent with the type of damage that might
    be sustained with regular and usual usage and further that the multiple locations
    of the damage suggest repeated incidents or impacts.&nbsp; Mr. Leier concluded,
    quite reasonably in my view, that there had been repeated vigorous striking
    of the vehicle by the large animal trying to gain entry into the vehicle
    when the windows were up.&nbsp; This would coincide with David’s evidence
    about the sudden rocking of the vehicle and Jennifer’s evidence about the
    sudden “bang”
    and movement of the vehicle.&nbsp; The motion caused David’s foot to slip
    from the clutch and in my view probably at the same time, although David
    was unaware of it, caused his arm or some part of his body to come into contact
    with the window switches inadvertently, and thereby lower the windows on
    both sides of the vehicle which allowed the tigers access to the passengers.&nbsp; In
    my view this is the most reasonable explanation for what occurred and it
    accords with the evidence which I accept [emphasis in the original].</p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>The trial
    judge then explained why she rejected the evidence of the six witnesses who
    testified that either Balac or Cowles had stated that the passenger’s window

    family members.  Then she assessed the claims of Balac’s family members.  Next,

      the trial judge considered the liability of ALS for the plaintiffs’ injuries
      caused by the tigers.  Following a lengthy liability analysis in which
      the issue was whether liability should rest on common law negligence principles
      or on strict liability regardless of fault, she found ALS strictly liable
      for the plaintiffs’ damages.  In the course of her analysis, the trial
      judge referred to academic discussions about whether a plaintiffs’ “contributory
      negligence” could reduce his or her damages in a case of strict liability.  Although
      the trial judge expressed doubts that it could, she concluded that she
      did not have to decide the issue.  In this regard, she stated at para.&nbsp;140:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In any event,
    I have found that the injuries to and the damages suffered by both plaintiffs
    resulted from the unprovoked attack on their vehicle by the tiger PACA.&nbsp;
    That forceful assault on the vehicle caused Mr. Balac’s body to inadvertently
    come into contact with the window switch resulting in the lowering of the
    windows on the vehicle which admitted the tiger into the vehicle.&nbsp; There
    was no conduct, in my view on the part of either David or Jennifer which
    would constitute contributory negligence on their part even if such defence
    were available.&nbsp; Their windows were up when they entered the Carnivore
    Section and were not deliberately put down for any purpose while in that
    Section before the attack, by either of them.</p>

      she indicated that although she had found ALS strictly liable, had she
      not come to that conclusion she would have found ALS liable in negligence.  In
      that situation, from what the trial judge said earlier, she would have
      reduced the plaintiffs’

    in which a case ought to be tried without a jury, or what constitutes a proper

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The trial judge
    did not exercise his discretion in dispensing with the jury on the ground
    that the nature of the evidence was too complex or technical for a jury to
    make a proper assessment.  On the contrary, as indicated in the excerpt from
    his reasons set forth above, he dispensed with the jury on the basis that
    the law to be applied to the facts as found by them was too difficult to
    explain to them.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>In my opinion,
      he erred in this regard.  It was his duty to determine the legal principles

      in which the corporate veil should be lifted or pierced.  See <i>Kummen
      v. Alfonso</i>, [1953] 1 D.L.R. 637, (Man. C.A.).  The trial judge was
      correct in so holding.  <i>It was a matter of law which he had to decide

      to be applied to guide it in giving its verdict on the basis of the findings
      of fact made by it in answer to proper questions left to it, than it was

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It is my view

    issues to which he referred were issues of law which it was his duty to decide

        judge would face in instructing the jury on the standard of care of a

      the trial judge is the person best situated to make this decision.  Motion
      judges have frequently been reversed on such decisions and the matter referred
      to the trial judge.  <i>At the opening of trial, the trial judge is not
      really in a better position than a motion judge to make the decision.  It
      is only as the trial progresses and the evidence goes in, that the trial
      judge's advantage over the motion judge develops.  For this reason, the

      and mathematical analysis to determine the position of the vehicles on
      the road at critical moments.  I do not think that the jury needs to understand

      that the medical evidence would be detailed, lengthy, complex, and conflicting.  She
      refused, however, to follow a “wait and see approach” because in her view,
      the evidentiary complexities “arise by reason of the very nature of the
      actions themselves.”  In effect, she prematurely speculated that the jury
      would be overwhelmed by the medical evidence adduced at trial when, in

      court held at para.&nbsp;70 of <i>Hunt </i>that it is an error of law to
      discharge a jury based on an inability to explain the applicable law to
      it.  In this case, at para.&nbsp;31 of her reasons the trial judge expressed
      uncertainty with respect to whether any defences are available where liability
      is based on strict liability.  This, of course, was a question of law.  As
      the appellant emphasizes at para.&nbsp;43 of its factum, “[t]rial judges
      are presumed to know the law and to be able to explain it to juries.”  If
      the trial judge was motivated to discharge the jury on the basis that it
      would be too difficult to explain the law of strict liability to the jury,
      together with any defence that applied, this is reversible error according
      to <i>Hunt</i>.  Although the trial judge discussed in some detail whether
      contributory negligence could reduce a plaintiff’s damages in a case of
      strict liability, because of her findings of fact, she did not ultimately
      have to decide this issue.  Had she retained the jury, it would have been
      necessary to decide the issue.  Having done so, it would have been a simple
      point on which to instruct the jury.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>The <i>Hunt </i>court emphasized at para.&nbsp;62 that an issue that
      is one of “mixed fact and law” is not necessarily complex.  At para.&nbsp;31
      of her reasons, the trial judge characterizes the liability issues as complex,
      especially because the issue of whether the doctrine of strict liability
      applied to the facts was “at best a question of mixed fact and law.”  As <i>Hunt </i>explains,
      it is incumbent on a trial judge to resolve questions of law and to explain
      the law to the jury who first finds facts and then determines how those
      facts apply to the law as outlined by the trial judge.  In her reasons
      for judgment, the trial judge held that this was a case of strict liability – a
      proposition that could easily have been explained to the jury had it been
      retained.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>In my view, the estimated length of the trial was an irrelevant factor
      on which the trial judge relied in striking the jury and, therefore, constituted
      an error of law.  The trial judge took into consideration a six-week estimate
      for completion of the trial.  This was not a relevant consideration and
      had no bearing on the complexity of facts or the predominance of legal
      issues at trial.  In any event, in the contemporary litigation world, many
      civil and criminal trials exceed six weeks.  In <i>Demeter v. Occidental
      Life Insurance Co. of California</i> (1979), 23 O.R. (2d) 31 (H.C.J.),
      aff’d 26 O.R. (2d) 391 (Div. Ct.) Labrosse&nbsp;J. (as he then was) suggested
      that the anticipated length of trial did not warrant striking out the jury
      in the circumstances.  In <i>Demeter, </i>the plaintiff was involved in
      related criminal proceedings that attracted extensive media coverage.  Labrosse
      J. noted in his reasons at p.&nbsp;34 that the issues arising in the civil
      context would be no more complex that those arising in the associated criminal
      arena:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>It cannot be disputed that the facts and issues of law will be complicated
      but there is nothing strange or exceptional about that.  Jurors often try
      very long and complicated murder or conspiracy trials.  A jury is presently
      on a very long trial involving some nine accused persons together with
      eleven companies charged with serious and complicated offences.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>In the present actions, the defences are substantially identical.  Numerous
      issues referred to in the material relate to the admissibility of evidence.  They
      will be decided by the trial Judge and not by a jury.  <i>I fail to see
      how the issues could be any more difficult than at the criminal trial of
      the plaintiff and they were decided by a jury</i>.  If they do become so
      complex, the trial Judge can exercise his discretion [emphasis added].</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my experience as a trial judge, I presided over several very lengthy criminal
    jury trials involving difficult concepts, such as complicated conspiracy
    trials that involved the co&#8209;conspirator’s exception to the hearsay
    rule, and trials where self&#8209;defence had to be explained to the jury.  Based
    on that experience, I have a high regard for the intelligence and common
    sense of juries.  If a jury can deal with similar issues in the criminal
    context, logically a jury should be able to deal with them in a civil context
    notwithstanding that in criminal trials the trial judge has no discretion
    to strike the jury.  Based on my experience on this court, I have a high
    regard for the ability of trial judges to explain difficult and complicated
    concepts of law and factual issues to a jury.  Moreover, if the jury experiences
    difficulty in understanding the trial judge’s instructions, clarification
    can be requested from the trial judge.  I would refer to the following observation
    of Dickson&nbsp;C.J. in <i>R. v. Corbett</i>, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670 at 692:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In my view,
    it would be quite wrong to make too much of the risk that the jury <i>might</i> use
    the evidence for an improper purpose.  This line of thinking could seriously
    undermine the entire jury system.  The very strength of the jury is that
    the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence is determined by a group of ordinary
    citizens who are not legal specialists and who bring to the legal process
    a healthy measure of common sense.  The jury is, of course, bound to follow
    the law as it is explained by the trial judge.  Jury directions are often
    long and difficult, but the experience of trial judges is that juries do
    perform their duty according to the law [emphasis in original].</p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>For a
    similar observation by Dickson&nbsp;C.J., see <i>R. v. Hill</i>, [1986] 1
    S.C.R. 313 at 334.  Although the observations of the Chief Justice were made
    in the context of criminal trials, logically, they apply to civil trials.  See,
    also, <i>Hamstra (Guardian ad Litem of) v. British Columbia Rugby Union</i>,
    [1997] 1 S.C.R. 1092 at para.&nbsp;15.</p>

    being of the view that the case involved complex liability issues, in particular
    whether this was a case of strict liability or one of negligence, and whether
    damages awarded on the basis of strict liability could be reduced by the
    plaintiffs’ contributory negligence, the trial judge properly identified
    legal issues that she was required to resolve.  In my view, however, this
    did not provide a “cogent” reason, to use the language of <i>King v. Colonial
    Homes Ltd.</i>, or a sound principled reason, to use the language of <i>Burton
    v. Harding and Marks</i>, to strike out the jury, thereby depriving ALS of
    its important substantive right to a jury trial.  In virtually every jury
    trial the trial judge is called upon to resolve legal issues and to provide
    appropriate instructions to the jury.  To say that doing so provides a cogent
    or principled reason for striking a jury, in my respectful view, would seriously
    diminish a party’s right to a jury trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[180]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, this was a case in which it was preferable for the trial judge to
    have reserved her decision on the motion to strike out the jury until after
    the evidence had been completed as counsel for ALS had urged her to do, or,
    perhaps, until a discrete problem arose.  As the cases emphasize, where,
    as in this case, a motion to strike out the jury on the ground of complexity
    is made at the outset of the trial before any testimony has been heard, the
    trial judge is in no better position to decide the motion than a motion judge
    who is asked to strike out a jury notice on the same ground.  The authorities
    which counsel a “wait and see” approach are informed by the important principle
    that the right to a jury trial is a fundamental substantive right that should
    not be interfered with except for very cogent reasons.  In my view, this
    approach is also informed by the fact that juries have tried multitudes of
    cases involving personal injuries sustained in circumstances where there
    is conflicting evidence about the cause of the injuries, the extent of the
    injuries, pecuniary and non&#8209;pecuniary damages, and they have been able
    to resolve these issues with the guidance received from trial judges. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[181]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
    subsequently occurred in this case shows that it would have been preferable
    for the trial judge to take a “wait and see” approach before ruling on the
    plaintiffs’ motion to strike the jury.  She rejected the suggestion of the
    appellant’s counsel to follow this approach because she considered that the “evidentiary
    complexities” were already a “reality”, stating at para.&nbsp;33 that they
    were “not merely possibilities which may arise in the future; they arise
    by reason of the very nature of the actions themselves”.  However, the wisdom
    of waiting until the evidence unfolded was illustrated soon after the jury
    was struck out, as the parties agreed on the amount of the plaintiffs’ general
    damages, thereby removing this issue from the case and greatly reducing the
    medical evidence tendered at trial which the trial judge had considered a “reality”.  As
    the authorities to which I have referred indicate, this is the preferable
    approach.  In yet an additional case, where the trial judge allowed a motion
    to strike out the jury at the commencement of the trial, this court had the
    following to say in <i>Sloane v. Toronto Stock Exchange</i> (1991), 5 O.R.
    (3d) 412:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>As this court
    has frequently stated, the right to trial by a jury is an important substantive
    right: see <i>Isaacs v. MHG International Ltd.</i> (1984), 45 O.R. (2d) 693,
    7 D.L.R. (4th) 570 (C.A.) and <i>Such v. Dominion Stores Ltd.</i>, [1961]
    O.R. 190, 26 D.L.R. (2d) 696 (C.A.).  <i>That right should not be denied
    prematurely</i>.  In our view, it was inappropriate to strike the jury notice
    in this case.  All of the evidence going to the question of whether or not
    there was just cause for the appellant’s dismissal was eminently suited to
    assessment by a jury.  <i>Had the unfolding of the evidence made it appropriate
    to do so, specific issues, such as those relating to the assessment of damages,
    could have been withdrawn from the jury.  We consider this an appropriate
    case in which to order a new trial before a jury</i> [emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>In this
    case, had the assessment of future loss of income, which was of concern to
    the trial judge, taken on a dimension that indicated it was not appropriate
    to leave to the jury, it could have been withdrawn from the jury and decided
    by the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[182]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    a small point, another factor relied on by the trial judge in striking the
    jury was her view that it would be difficult to explain the various roles
    of counsel.  In my view, this was irrelevant to whether the jury would be
    able to carry out its function, and, thus, constitutes an error in law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[183]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    asked to strike the jury, the general approach taken by the court is to ask
    what it is about the case that makes it inappropriate to be decided by a
    jury.  No doubt this is because the onus rests on the party moving to strike
    the jury to satisfy the court that it is appropriate to do so.  As I have
    observed, almost invariably when a motion succeeds it is because the case
    is seen as too complex to be tried by a jury.  In my view, there is an important
    factor in this analysis that is usually overlooked.  The court should also
    ask whether the essential character of the plaintiff’s claim and its underlying
    facts make the case suitable for a jury trial.  Approached from this perspective,
    at the time the plaintiffs’ motion was argued the essential character of
    their claims was damages for injuries sustained as a result of the defendant’s
    negligence, with only one factual issue to be decided, and general damages
    and past and future income loss to be assessed.  For decades, if not centuries,
    juries have decided these issues.  Indeed, as the factual issue concerning
    the car windows engaged credibility considerations, it was eminently suited
    to be decided by the jury.</p>

    I am of the opinion that the trial judge erred in the exercise of her discretion
    in discharging the jury, the issue becomes whether I should order a new trial.  This
    calls for the application of the test articulated by the Supreme Court of
    Canada in <i>King v. Colonial Homes Ltd</i>.  Applying this test, in my view
    it is far from clear that a properly instructed jury acting reasonably must
    inevitably have reached the same result as did the trial judge.  The central
    factual issue in the case was whether the passenger’s window was left open
    by Cowles for the purpose of taking a picture, or whether this window and
    the driver’s window were opened by Balac through inadvertence.  In making
    her finding that the windows were opened through inadvertence, the trial
    judge rejected the evidence of six witnesses who testified that Cowles or
    Balac had told them that Cowles had opened the passenger’s window to take
    a picture.  The remarkable feature of the evidence of the six witnesses was
    that it was identical in attributing to Cowles an admission that she had
    opened the window.  A jury could well have taken a different view of the
    reliability of these witnesses and of Balac and Cowles than did the trial
    judge.  Although the trial judge was entitled to reject the evidence of the
    six witnesses, a jury might not have done so.  </p>

    a simple fact situation, the plaintiffs contend that this is a very complex
    case.  As I have endeavoured to illustrate in my review of the factors that
    the trial judge relied on to strike the jury, I am not satisfied that there
    were issues of such difficulty that the experienced trial judge could not
    have made them plain for the consideration and findings of the jury, aided
    as it would be by the questions drafted by counsel and approved by the trial
    judge.  In my view, the comments of Laidlaw&nbsp;J.A. in <i>Neelands</i> which
    are quoted in para.&nbsp;29 of my reasons apply to the circumstances of this
    case in which, to adopt the language of Laidlaw&nbsp;J.A., the “distinct,
    clear&#8209;cut issue between the parties” is how the car’s windows came
    to be open permitting the tigers to maul the plaintiffs.  In addition, Goodman
    J.A.’s analysis of the circumstances in <i>Cosford</i> which is quoted in
    para.&nbsp;32 also apply to the facts of this case.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    reviewing the cases in which the court has considered whether to strike a
    jury on the ground of complexity, I was struck by the absence of any attempt
    to define what constitutes a case that is too complex to be trusted to a
    jury.  In addition, I was struck by the absence of any analysis as to why
    some cases should not be tried by a jury and others should be, and by a similar
    absence of any analysis as to why a judge is presumed to be able to do a
    better job than a jury.  Although juries have rendered fair and rational
    verdicts for centuries in very complicated criminal trials (see, for example, <i>R.
    v. McNamara</i>, <i>No.&nbsp;1</i> (1981), 566 C.C.C. (2d) 193 (Ont. C.A.)
    which was a fifteen month trial followed by an eleven day jury charge), why
    is it assumed that they are not capable of doing so when the same circumstances
    become the subject of a civil action?  In reading the judicial opinions,
    it is difficult to escape the conclusion that decisions about the right to
    a jury trial in particular cases are informed more by intuition and assumptions
    about the relative abilities of juries and judges than by empirical knowledge.  Stated
    somewhat differently, without the benefit of supporting empirical data, the
    hypothesis used to support striking a jury is that jurors, but not judges,
    are incompetent to deal rationally with complex civil cases.  To this I would
    add, as it is accepted that a jury trial presents more management issues
    for a trial judge than a bench trial and requires the trial judge to prepare
    and deliver instructions to the jury, in my view judges must be careful to
    avoid subconscious bias in favour of a bench trial when confronted by a motion
    to strike the jury.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is a significant difference in Canada and the United States in the jurisprudence
    on the subject of striking juries.  In the United States, the Seventh Amendment
    to the Constitution of the United States of America guarantees a right to
    trial by jury in civil cases brought in a federal court.  This has given
    rise to a considerable volume of case law and academic literature on whether
    there is, or should be, a “complexity exception” to a litigant’s constitutional
    right to a civil jury trial.<a
href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[7]</span></a>  What
    is instructive about the American experience is the nature of the cases that
    are commonly characterized as complex and form the foundation for motions
    to strike the jury.  In the United States, “complexity exception”
    arguments are to be found typically in antitrust, securities, patent, fraud
    and mass tort cases in which it is contended that there are issues which
    are too complicated for a jury to understand and render a rational verdict.  In
    Canada, of course, few, if any such cases are tried by a jury.  However,
    among the very few American cases where a court has been asked to strike
    a jury in a personal injury case, the court has never done so.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While

    States<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span

    exception” to a litigant’s right to a jury trial contained in s.&nbsp;108(1)
    of the <i>CJA</i> has been recognized in this province.  The contrast between
    what is characterized as a complex case in the American and Canadian jurisprudence
    is stark.  There is nothing in s.&nbsp;108(1) or s.&nbsp;108(2) of the <i>CJA</i> that
    creates a complexity exception in the legislature’s iteration of the claims
    that can and cannot be tried by a jury.  The exception has been created by
    the exercise of judicial discretion.  The result is that a litigant stands
    to be deprived of his or her statutory right to a jury trial if his or her
    claim is found to be complex.  It is troubling that two classes of cases
    have been created resulting in a double standard –
    simple cases that a jury can be trusted to decide, and complex cases that
    only a judge is deemed competent to decide.<a

    very through and helpful discussion of whether jurors are competent to decide
    complex cases is that of Mark&nbsp;T.&nbsp;Cowie, “Juries and Complex Trials”,
    in Vol.&nbsp;3 <i>Jury Service in Victoria: Final Report</i>, ch. 2 (Melbourne,
    Victoria: Parliament of Victoria, Victorian Law Reform Committee, 1997).  The
    author wrote a research paper that was commissioned by the Victorian Law
    Reform Committee to assist it in carrying out a reference from the Victorian
    Governor in Council in relation to the jury system in Victoria.  At pp.&nbsp;56&#8209;57
    he concluded that there was not a “good historical foundation for the argument
    that plaintiffs may be denied the right to a jury trial because their cases
    are complex”, having found on the evidence available “that the case of jury
    incompetence in complex litigation has not been made out”.  However, at p.&nbsp;57
    he added:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>This, however,
    is not to suggest that the involvement of juries in complex litigation is
    without its difficulties.  In fact, many of the alleged weaknesses and difficulties
    have arisen because the practices and procedures employed in the trial process
    have not been designed with the needs and capacities of jurors in mind.  It
    would seem that if we are to preserve trial by jury in complex cases we must
    be willing to take measures which will assist juries in performing their
    difficult task.  Simple changes such as appropriate breaks, the provision
    of facilities to encourage note taking, improved juror comfort, providing
    jurors with the opportunity to ask questions of witnesses, and the provision
    of transcripts would go a long way towards eradicating or lessening the problems.  Also,
    there can be little argument with the notion that the jury system works at
    a more optimum level when the issues are clearly defined, evidence is presented
    in manageable proportions, and the case is conducted in a manner which is
    coherent and well structured.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[190]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Earlier,
    Mr.&nbsp;Cowie attempted to define a “complex” case.  Although noting that
    cases involving issues calling for scientific, technical, or other specialized
    knowledge, with conflicting and contradictory opinions from experts, are
    frequently found to be complex, he was unable to present a compendious definition.  However,
    at p.&nbsp;10 he observed that the “term <i>complexity</i> has multiple,
    ambiguous meaning and carries evaluative connations in addition to its apparent
    descriptive meaning”.  He added at p.&nbsp;11 that “any attempt to isolate
    what makes a trial complex is a subjective venture”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[191]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    I were to venture a description of a case that it is so complex as to be
    problematic for a jury, I would use as a model one that is so lengthy that
    it encompasses volumes of oral and documentary evidence, a multitude of issues,
    numerous parties, technical evidence, and, perhaps, difficult questions of
    law.  In my view, none of these characteristics feature in this case which,
    in essence, is a simple personal injury case arising from the negligence
    of the defendant or, possibly, the plaintiffs.  Juries are well&#8209;suited
    to resolve credibility issues and to quantify damages.  With appropriate
    instructions by the trial judge in the law and careful articulation of the
    issues, in this case a jury should have no difficulty in resolving the essential
    factual issues and in assessing the past and future loss of income sustained
    by the plaintiffs.  At risk of repetition, in considering whether to strike
    a jury, the court must keep in mind the paramountcy of a litigant’s right
    to a jury trial and avoid limiting this right to short, simple cases, while
    denying it in those cases which appear to require lengthier trials and involve
    less simple issues.  To this end, the focus must remain on the statutory
    right to a jury trial, and should not be on the perceived difficulty that
    the trial judge may have in crafting jury instructions.  This, of course,
    is part of the traditional role of a trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    I turn to a consideration that is virtually overlooked or ignored in Canadian
    jurisprudence.  I refer to the failure of courts to consider measures that
    are available to preserve a litigant’s right to a jury trial by resort to
    techniques designed to assist juries in their roles.  As I have mentioned,
    one device that is always used is the submission of questions for the jury

    cases involving multiple parties and issues, to preserve the right to a jury
    trial judges and lawyers have a role to play in structuring the trial in
    such a way as to provide jurors with the most possible assistance.  In my
    view, early, active involvement by the judiciary is critical in managing
    complex litigation.  Rule&nbsp;50, providing for pre&#8209;trial conferences,
    gives the court broad powers in scheduling, management and the defining of
    issues.  If effectively used, in a complex case a succession of pre&#8209;trial
    conferences should enable the judge and counsel to develop a trial management
    plan that includes schedules and other procedures for identifying and resolving
    disputed issues of law, and by clarifying and narrowing disputed issues of
    fact.  If the plans are followed, the issues at trial will be clearly defined
    and should be more easily understood by the jury.  Counsel should be required
    to take advantage of rule 51.02 by serving a request to admit facts, and
    should be prepared to stipulate to matters not in genuine dispute.  To facilitate
    the litigating of issues in dispute, with respect to each issue the parties
    should present a detailed outline of their contentions, with supporting facts
    and evidence.  Thus, the judge must take an active role in determining how
    a trial will be best structured to assist the jury in fulfilling its role.  In
    addition, consideration should be given to permitting jurors to take notes
    and to ask written questions, and trial judges should be able to provide
    each juror preliminary and final written instructions.</p>

    excluding the evidence of an investigator retained by counsel for ALS to
    conduct surveillance of Cowles in the course of which he had conversations
    with her at a time when Cowles was represented by counsel.  The trial judge
    excluded his evidence on the ground that the investigator had violated rule&nbsp;4.03(2)
    of the <i>Rules of Professional Conduct of the Law Society of Upper Canada</i> which
    precludes a lawyer from approaching or dealing with a person who is represented
    by another lawyer, except with the consent of the party’s lawyer.  She held
    that whether the approach is by a lawyer or by an investigator retained by
    the lawyer, rule&nbsp;4.03(2) applied and its violation required the exclusion
    of evidence thereby obtained.</p>

    is entitled “Interviewing Witnesses”.  The Law Society’s commentary to rule&nbsp;4.03(2)
    provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>This rule applies
    to communications with any person, whether or not a party to a formal adjudicative
    proceeding, contract, or negotiation, who is represented by counsel concerning
    the matter to which the communication relates.  A lawyer may communicate
    with a represented person or an employee or agent of such a person, concerning
    matters outside the representation.  Also parties to a matter may communicate
    directly with each other.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The prohibition
    on communications with a represented person applies only where the lawyer
    knows that the person is represented in the matter to be discussed.  This
    means that the lawyer has actual knowledge of the fact of the representation,
    but actual knowledge may be inferred from the circumstances.  This inference
    may arise whether there is substantial reason to believe that the person
    with whom communication is sought is represented in the matter to be discussed.  Thus,
    a lawyer cannot evade the requirement of obtaining the consent of counsel
    by closing eyes to the obvious.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>In my
    view, it is clear from the language of the rule and the commentary that the
    purpose of the rule is to prevent lawyers from circumventing other lawyers
    by dealing directly with their clients.  There is no evidence that counsel
    for ALS intended or instructed the investigator to approach Cowles with the
    intent of “dealing” with her.  Had there been evidence that this is what
    had occurred, counsel might have been in breach of rule&nbsp;4.03(2).  However,
    this would then be a matter for the Law Society to consider as the court
    seldom, if ever, becomes involved in such matters.</p>

    a member’s contravention of a rule is brought to the attention of the Law
    Society, it may result in the commencement of a disciplinary proceeding against
    the member.  However, the<i> Rules of Professional Conduct</i> do not, and
    could not, affect the admissibility of relevant evidence in civil or criminal
    proceedings.  Thus, even if it could be said that counsel for ALS contravened
    rule&nbsp;4.03(2), this would not affect the admissibility of relevant evidence
    acquired by the investigator.</p>

    testimony is that the surveillance of Cowles occurred at a “strip club” where
    she was employed as an exotic dancer before and after the incident with the
    tigers.  Considering the excerpts from the report contained in the affidavit,
    what the investigator saw and heard would be capable of adversely affecting
    Cowles’s credibility, which is likely why she attacked this admissibility
    of this evidence.  Unfortunately, the trial judge did not consider whether
    this evidence was relevant but focused only on how it was obtained.  There
    can be no doubt that it is in the public interest to ensure that all relevant
    evidence is available to the court.  This is essential if justice is to be

    commencing this action against ALS, the plaintiff Cowles has placed in issue
    the cause and extent of her injuries.  In my view, having placed these factors
    in issue, it would be reasonable for Cowles to assume that ALS would investigate
    her claim, in the course of which it might hire an investigator to make observations
    of her activity and, if possible, to converse with her if she agreed to do
    so.  Having put in issue her medical condition and the cause of her injuries,
    Cowles cannot complain where ALS seeks to introduce evidence that its investigator
    acquired relevant to these issues.  <i>Cf.</i>, <i>Cook v. Ip</i> <i>et al</i> (1985),

    case, the admission of the evidence requires a showing of relevance to the
    credibility of a witness on a material matter and a demonstration that the
    potential value of the evidence for this purpose outweighs its potential
    prejudicial effect.  The trial judge, unfortunately, failed to address these
    factors.  Although the record concerning the surveillance evidence is incomplete,
    in my view it is reasonable to infer that it was relevant to Cowles’s credibility
    in respect to the circumstances surrounding the attack by the tigers.  In
    addition, if she were to be disbelieved on this matter, the reliability of
    the evidence of her expert might also suffer to the extent that it was based

    for the next ground of appeal, ALS contends that notwithstanding that it
    may be strictly liable to the plaintiffs for causing their injuries, the
    damages recoverable by them can, as a matter of law, be reduced by the degree
    of their fault in causing the injuries and their damages could be negated
    if they came about by the “plaintiff’s own act”.  In argument before us,
    this was referred to as the contributory negligence defence.  Although at
    paras. 126&#8209;141 of her reasons the trial judge discussed whether contributory
    negligence is available to a defendant found to be strictly liable, in the
    final analysis she concluded that it was unnecessary to decide this issue
    given her finding that Balac inadvertently opened the car windows enabling
    the tigers to enter the car and attack the plaintiffs.  However, the trial
    judge doubted that contributory negligence could apply, stating at para.&nbsp;139: “It
    seems to me contradictory to hold a defendant strictly liable – <i>i.e.</i> whether
    negligent or not – and then to consider a plaintiff’s ‘contributory’ negligence.”</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her analysis of whether ALS was strictly liable for the damages caused by
    its tigers, the trial judge made extensive reference to passages from J.G.
    Fleming, <i>The Law Torts</i>, 9th ed. (North Ryde: LBC Information Services,
    1998) and G.H.L. Fridman, <i>The Law of Torts in Canada</i>, 2nd ed. (Toronto:
    Carswell, 2002), that discuss liability for damages caused by different categories
    of animals.  These passages also contain discussions of whether there is

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the purpose of this analysis, I proceed on the common understanding of strict
    liability as liability that does not depend on actual negligence or an intent
    to cause harm, but that is based on the breach of a duty to make something
    safe.  However, it is important to note that strict liability is not absolute
    and that in the appropriate circumstances may give rise to a defence arising
    from the plaintiff’s conduct.  In the case of wild animals such as tigers,
    the underlying rationale for anchoring liability on the doctrine of strict
    liability is that anyone who maintains an animal that is known to be dangerous
    to humans does so at his or her peril.  While strict liability removes the
    burden of having to prove breach of a standard of care, it does not relieve
    the plaintiff from having to prove causation.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The range of
    defences is exceedingly limited.  Indeed, no excuse seems to be admitted <i>except
    the plaintiff’s own responsibility in exposing himself to injury</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It is well settled,
    for example, <i>that the defendant may take advantage of the victim having
    brought the injury upon himself through his own fault</i>, as by stroking
    a zebra that is improperly secured or actually teasing an animal, though
    not by merely walking close to it unless in unreasonable disregard of obvious
    danger.  <i>Authority is unclear on whether contributory negligence ever
    constituted a defence such as would now reduce damages</i> [footnotes omitted;

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(A) <i>Contributory
      negligence</i> If the circumstances justify such a conclusion, <i>a court
      may find that the injured plaintiff has brought about his injury, in part
      at least, by his own neglect for his safety.  Indeed, the plaintiff may
      be totally responsible</i>, as in <i>Dowler v. Bravender</i>, where the
      owner of a horse which kicked the plaintiff did not discharge the onus
      of proving that he lacked knowledge of the horse’s dangerous propensity,
      yet the defendant was not liable <i>because the plaintiff brought the injury
      on herself by shouting at and frightening the horse</i>.  Whether a plaintiff
      is guilty of contributory negligence is a question of fact.  Once such
      conduct is established, its effect in law depends upon the application
      of common law or statutory principles relating to the apportionment of
      liability in consequence of contributory negligence [emphasis added].</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Sometimes it
    has been suggested that liability is absolute, where the animal is wild or
    a domestic animal known to be dangerous.  <i>This cannot be accurate, because
    it is clear that there are limits upon the liability of the defendant, for
    example, contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff, voluntary
    assumption of risk or consent, the act of a stranger, or an act of God</i>.  <i>Hence,

    Vol.&nbsp;4 (Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1986), at pp.&nbsp;304&#8209;318,
    there is a thorough discussion about the effect of a plaintiff’s misconduct
    as a contributory factor in respect to his or her damages in circumstances
    where a defendant is strictly liable.  It is apparent from the discussion
    that there are two concepts in play.  The first is the plaintiff’s contributory
    negligence as a defence, while the second is apportionment of liability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[210]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the discussion of a plaintiff’s contributory negligence is in the context
    of jurisdictions in which it constitutes a complete defence, although not
    strictly relevant to this case, it is instructive.  The authors point to
    the difficulty of calling a plaintiff’s negligence
    “contributory” when because of the defendant’s strict liability there is
    no negligence of the defendant to which it can contribute.  However, at p.&nbsp;304
    they characterize the difficulty “as no more than a play on words” and suggest
    that the difficulty can be avoided by noting that a plaintiff’s negligence
    may be called
    “contributory” if it contributes to his injury.  If it does, for policy reasons
    this should be taken into account in the reduction of damages and should
    not constitute a complete defence.  However, even where liability is strict,
    the substantial weight of authority barred a plaintiff’s recovery where he
    or she assents to or assumes the risk.  As the authors state in pp.&nbsp;307&#8209;308:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>If plaintiff
    actually knows of the risk and appreciates it, yet unreasonably encounters
    it, he will probably be barred even where the relationship between the parties
    is not one of voluntary association that either one is free to take or leave
    as he will.  Such conduct is often called
    “assumption of risk”, but it does not constitute assumption of risk in the
    primary sense.  It is a case where plaintiff is barred because his conduct
    is unreasonable and involves fault of a graver kind than mere inadvertence
    or carelessness.  “Assumption of risk” here means willful and unreasonable
    self&#8209;exposure to risk [footnotes omitted].</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    p.&nbsp;310 <i>et seq.</i> the authors point out that the judicial approach
    to a plaintiff’s misconduct as a contributing factor to his or her damages
    where a defendant is strictly liable changed with the widespread acceptance
    of comparative negligence.  More courts were willing to recognize a comparative
    negligence “defence” based on a plaintiff’s misconduct than had been willing
    to recognize a contributory negligence defence.  And they included unreasonable
    conduct other than that which involved the encountering of a known risk.  Applying
    comparative negligence theory tended to reduce the amount of a plaintiff’s
    damages, rather than to prevent a plaintiff’s recovery.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Under common

    Professor Osborne writes:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>There are a
    number of defences to the scienter action.  To a large extent, they mirror
    the defences in the rule in <i>Rylands v. Fletcher</i>.  Four of the defences –
    default of the plaintiff, consent, trespass of the plaintiff, and illegality –
    address common concerns and often overlap.  They withhold the advantage of
    strict liability from the plaintiff where he is, for one reason or another,
    undeserving or to some degree blameworthy.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><b>a)            Default
      of the Plaintiff</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>There is no
    liability if the injury is the result of the plaintiff’s fault.  This mirrors
    the nineteenth&#8209;century common law rule in negligence where contributory
    negligence was a complete bar to an action.  It has been applied most frequently
    where the plaintiff entered an animal’s cage, came too close to the animal,
    or attempted to feed or pet the animal.  Some of these situations may now
    be similarly resolved on the ground that there has been no loss of control
    of the animal by the keeper.  This position is out of step with current policies
    that do not favour the allocation of all personal injury losses to a careless
    plaintiff, and it seems a particularly harsh result in the scienter action,
    based as it is on the defendant’s knowledge of the danger of his animal.  Apportionment
    is a much fairer result but the provincial apportionment legislation was
    not written with strict liability torts in mind.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><b>b)            Consent</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Consent is established
    where the plaintiff has voluntarily exposed herself to the risk of injury
    by the animal.  Placing oneself in harm’s way with knowledge of the danger
    posed by the animal is probably sufficient.  This, too, reflects the defence
    of voluntary assumption of risk as it was interpreted in nineteenth&#8209;century
    negligence law and is closely related to the defence of default of the plaintiff.</p>

    and non&#8209;dangerous animals.  However, s.&nbsp;5(1) of the Act provides

    I would leave that innovation to Parliament because such a change would be
    more appropriate for the legislative branch to make.  As I see it, the strict
    liability feature of conversion is well engrained in the jurisprudence concerning
    bills of exchange [emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>In my
    respectful view, in stating contributory negligence is not available in the
    context of a strict liability tort, Iacobucci&nbsp;J. was not intending to
    state a general principle.  Rather, he was referring to the law of bills
    of exchange in respect to which Parliament has legislated in the <i>Bills
    of Exchange Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c.&nbsp;B&#8209;4.</p>

    trial judge considered it to be “contradictory” to reduce a plaintiff’s damages
    arising from a defendant’s strict liability.  While recognizing that the
    authority on the question is not uniform, with respect, I do not agree.  In
    the case of dangerous animals, society condones the keeping of them on condition
    that the owner or keeper of the animal pay its way when the animal causes
    injury, regardless of whether the keeper has been careless or negligent in
    its keeping of the animal.  Although the principle of strict liability removes
    the burden of a plaintiff having to prove breach of a standard of care, it
    does not relieve a plaintiff from having to prove causation.  In my view,
    the application of a principle akin to comparative negligence to strict liability
    would not defeat or frustrate the rationale that led to the development of
    the principle of strict liability.  Plaintiffs will continue to be relieved
    of proof of a defendant’s negligence.  The defendant’s liability for keeping
    a dangerous animal will remain strict.  A plaintiff’s recovery will be reduced
    only to the extent that his or her lack of reasonable care contributed to
    the cause of his or her injuries.  In a case where the evidence demonstrates
    that the plaintiffs’ “own act” was the sole cause of his or her damages,
    although the defendant remains strictly liable for the damages, the plaintiff
    will obtain no recovery.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    it may appear to be doctrinally counterintuitive to apply comparative negligence
    principles where a defendant’s liability is strict and not dependant on negligence,
    in my view functional and fairness considerations strongly suggest that comparative
    negligence principles are appropriate where a plaintiff’s misconduct or want
    of care is a contributing factor to his or her damages.  Of course, each
    case will depend on its own facts.  While it may be said that a defendant’s
    liability should not be diluted when a loss occurs that strict liability
    is intended to prevent, there will be cases where a plaintiff’s misconduct
    is so clearly a contributory factor, or the contributory factor, that it
    will seem, to many, to be more unfair to ignore it than to consider it.  This
    would favour the application of comparative negligence principles for a plaintiff’s
    failure to exercise reasonable care in relation to dangerous animals, and
    to reduce the plaintiff’s damages accordingly.  As I have indicated, comparative
    negligence principles have been incorporated into the English <i>Animals
    Act 1971</i> and the Ontario <i>Dog Owners’ Liability Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[219]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    in cases of strict liability, a plaintiff’s conduct in respect to the cause
    of his or her damages will not escape unexamined.  In my view, there can
    be do doubt that in the presence of a wild animal, such as a tiger, a person
    is required to take reasonable care for her own safety.  This is a common
    sense proposition arising from the existence of circumstances that reasonably
    require that care be taken, and which ALS brought to the attention of park
    visitors by posting several warning signs.  As to that share or portion of
    his or her damages that flow from his or her fault, there is no policy reason
    why it should be borne by others.  Where a plaintiff’s own act is the sole
    cause of his injury, this will completely bar any recovery notwithstanding
    the defendant’s strict liability.  With respect, the trial judge’s insistence
    on a fixed and precise doctrinal approach to legal concepts led her to doubt
    the application of principles of contributory negligence in cases of strict
    liability.  In my view, some conceptual overlapping and interweaving is required
    to attain substantial justice for the parties in circumstances where, doctrinally,
    a defendant is strictly liable and, factually, the plaintiff’s behaviour
    was a contributing cause of his or her damages.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying
    on several grounds, the trial judge found that this case was too complex
    to be decided by a jury.  As I understand her reasons, she placed particular
    emphasis on the difficult issues of law and mixed law and fact that the case
    presented, specifically the legal basis for the defendant’s liability and
    whether contributory negligence could reduce damages arising from a defendant’s
    strict liability.  As I have explained, these grounds did not constitute
    a cogent, or a sound principled reason, for discharging the jury.  As I have
    also explained, I am not satisfied that a jury acting reasonably would inevitably
    have come to the same decision as did the trial judge.  While it is regrettable
    that there must be a new trial, the defendant was <i>prima facie</i> entitled
    to have the issues of fact determined by a jury, a right of which it was
    deprived in the absence of a cogent or sound principled reason.  There is
    no doubt that the cases on this subject indicate a tension between deference
    to the trial judge and ensuring that justice to the parties is properly served
    by intervening to protect a party’s important substantive right to a jury
    trial where he or she has been deprived of that right except for cogent and
    sound principled reasons.  In my view, the right to trial by jury should
    supercede deference in the absence any cogent or principled reason for striking
    out the jury where it is clear that a jury might not have come to the same
    result as did the trial judge.</p>

    all the above reasons I would allow the appeal with costs, set aside the

    opinion has been expressed by the Supreme Court of the United States where
    the 7th Amendment to the Constitution preserves the right to jury trial in
    civil actions in a federal court.  In <i>Dimick v. Schiedt</i>, 293 U.S.
    474, 486 (1935) the court stated: “Maintenance of the jury as a fact&#8209;finding
    body is of such importance and occupies so firm a place in our history and
    jurisprudence that any seeming curtailment of the right to a jury trial should
    be scrutinized with the utmost care.”  More than a century earlier, in <i>Parsons
    v. Bedford</i>, 3 Pet. 443, 445 (1830), Justice Story stressed: “The trial
    by a jury is justly dear to the American people.  It has always been an object
    of deep interest and solicitude, and every encroachment upon it has been
    watched with great jealously.”  See, also, <i>Teamsters v. Terry</i>, 494

    the prosecution.  A judge will be able to grant an application if “the complexity

    so burdensome to the members of a jury hearing the trial that the interests
    of justice require that serious consideration should be given to the question
