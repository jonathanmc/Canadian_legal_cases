      on December 1, 2004 and sentence dated December 22, 2004, by Justice Monte
      H. Harris of the Ontario Court of Justice, made at Toronto, Ontario.</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>LASKIN J.A.:</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>A. OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>     The principal issue
    on this appeal is whether an encounter between three police officers and
    an eighteen-year-old youth on the streets of Toronto in broad daylight amounted
    to a detention and a search contrary to ss. 9 and 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>     Two plainclothes
    officers patrolling the Greenwood and Danforth area of Toronto noticed the
    appellant walk past them in a manner they considered “suspicious.” They asked
    a uniformed officer in the area to have a “chat” with him. The uniformed
    officer stood in the appellant’s path, told him to keep his hands in front
    of him, and began questioning him. The two plainclothes officers arrived
    and stood behind the other officer. Initially, the appellant was asked only
    for identification, but then the questioning turned to whether he had ever
    been arrested and whether “he had anything on him that he shouldn’t.” In
    response to the latter question, the appellant said that he had a small amount
    of marijuana and then, after being asked if he had anything else, he admitted
    that he also had a loaded revolver. The police arrested the appellant, seized
    the revolver from his waist pouch, and charged him with five firearms offences.
    The Crown acknowledged that the police had neither reasonable grounds to
    detain the appellant, nor reasonable grounds to search him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>     The appellant brought
    a motion to exclude the revolver from the evidence at trial, claiming a violation
    of his <i>Charter</i> rights not to be arbitrarily detained (s. 9) or subjected
    to an unreasonable search (s. 8) and his right to counsel (s. 10(b)). The
    trial judge found neither a detention nor a search. He dismissed the motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>     The appellant was
    convicted of all five offences,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a> and sentenced as a youthful first offender
    to eighteen months’ imprisonment, reduced to twelve months on account of
    his pre-trial custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>     The appellant appeals
    both his convictions and his sentence. His conviction appeal raises these
    four issues:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i) Did the trial judge err in concluding that
    the appellant was not detained? And if the appellant was detained, was he
    detained before or after admitting to carrying marijuana?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii) Did the trial judge err in concluding that
    the police’s questioning did not amount to a search?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii) If the appellant’s constitutional rights
    were violated, should the revolver have been excluded from evidence under
    s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iv) Even if the revolver was properly admitted,
    did the trial judge err in convicting the appellant of possession of a firearm
    for the purpose of transferring it contrary to s. 100(1) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, in the absence of any evidence that he intended to transfer it
    to another person? </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the appellant succeeds on his fourth submission, he asks that his sentence
    be reduced.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>B. THE LEGAL CONTEXT: THE MEANING
      OF “DETENTION”</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant submits that the police breached his s. 9 <i>Charter</i> right.
      Section 9 of the <i>Charter</i> guarantees everyone the right “not to be
      arbitrarily detained.” A detention for investigative purposes will not
      be arbitrary if the police have reasonable grounds to detain a person:
      see <i>R. v.</i> <i>Mann</i> (2004), 185 C.C.C. (3d) 308 (S.C.C.). Here,
      however, as I have said, the Crown accepts that when the police initially
      questioned the appellant, they did not have reasonable grounds to detain
      him. If he was detained at that time, his detention was unlawful and arbitrary.
      Thus, whether the police breached the appellant’s constitutional right
      under s. 9 of the <i>Charter</i> turns on whether he was “detained” when
      he was being questioned.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Detentions
      that trigger <i>Charter</i> rights are of two kinds: physical and
    “psychological.” The appellant was not physically detained. As is the case
    with most street encounters between a citizen and the police, the issue here
    is whether the appellant’s liberty was “psychologically” restrained. In Canada,
    the classic statement of a psychological detention comes from the judgment
    of Le Dain J. in <i>R. v. Therens</i> (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at 505 (S.C.C.):</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In my opinion, it is not realistic,
      as a general rule, to regard compliance with a demand or direction by a
      police officer as truly voluntary, in the sense that the citizen feels
      that he or she has the choice to obey or not, even where there is in fact
      a lack of statutory or common law authority for the demand or direction
      and therefore an absence of criminal liability for failure to comply with
      it. Most citizens are not aware of the precise legal limits of police authority.
      Rather than risk the application of physical force or prosecution for wilful
      obstruction, the reasonable person is likely to err on the side of caution,
      assume lawful authority and comply with the demand. The element of psychological
      compulsion, in the form of a reasonable perception of suspension of freedom
      of choice, is enough to make the restraint of liberty involuntary. Detention
      may be effected without the application or threat of application of physical
      restraint if the person concerned submits or acquiesces in the deprivation
      of liberty and reasonably believes that the choice to do otherwise does
      not exist.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      his later judgment in <i>R. v. Thomsen</i> (1988), 40 C.C.C. (3d) 411 at
      412, Le Dain J. reaffirmed that “the necessary element of compulsion or
      coercion to constitute a detention may arise from criminal liability for
      refusal to comply with a demand or direction, <u>or from a reasonable belief
      that one does not have a choice as to whether or not to comply</u>” [emphasis
      added].</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      definition of “psychological detention” reflects a judicial balance between
      competing values. On the one hand, the police have the duty and the authority
      to investigate and prevent crime in order to keep our community safe. In
      carrying out their duty, they must interact daily with ordinary citizens.
      Not every such encounter between the police and a citizen amounts to a
      constitutional “detention.” This court and other courts have recognized
      that police must be able to speak to a citizen without triggering that
      citizen’s <i>Charter</i> rights.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      main decision in this province affirming the police’s right to question
      citizens is the judgment of Krever J.A. in <i>R. v. Grafe</i> (1987), 36
      C.C.C. (3d) 267 at 271:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The law has long recognized that
      although there is no legal duty there is a moral or social duty on the
      part of every citizen to answer questions put to him or her by the police
      and, in that way to assist the police: see, for example, <i>Rice v. Connolly</i> [citation
      omitted]. Implicit in that moral or social duty is the right of a police
      officer to ask questions even, in my opinion, when he or she has no belief
      that an offence has been committed. </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-US>See also the judgment of Osborne J.A. in <i>R. v. Hall</i> (1995),
      22 O.R. (3d) 289 (C.A.).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      the other hand, ordinary citizens must have the right to move freely about
      their community. Thus, the police cannot detain a citizen for questioning
      unless they are authorized by law to do so. And whether questioning gives
      rise to a detention must be assessed in the light of the concern expressed
      by Le Dain J. in <i>Therens</i>: that most citizens are unaware of the
      limits of the police’s authority and the concern expressed by Iacobucci
      J. in <i>Mann</i> at para. 18 about “the potential for abuse inherent in
      such low-visibility exercises of discretionary power”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Perhaps
      because of these concerns, the appellant urged us to draw some “bright-
      line”
    rules to govern encounters between police and citizens on city streets: questions
    merely asking for identification would not give rise to a detention; but
    questions about a person’s personal possessions or inviting incriminating
    responses would amount to a psychological detention. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Bright-line
      rules in these situations have the advantage of certainty. But they are
      ill-suited to address the myriad of circumstances and contexts in which
      these encounters occur. My colleague Doherty J.A. made this point in <i>Brown
      v. Durham</i> <i>Regional Police Force</i> (1998), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at
      para. 62:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Obviously, clear and readily discernible
      rules governing the extent to which the police can interfere with individual
      liberties are most desirable. The infinite variety of situations in which
      the police and individuals interact and the need to carefully balance important
      but competing interests in each of those situations make it difficult,
      if not impossible, to provide preformulated bright-line rules which appropriately
      maintain the balance between police powers and individual liberties.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Thus,
      whether a police-citizen encounter gives rise to a detention must be a
      fact-specific and context-sensitive inquiry: see <i>R. v. Moran</i> (1987),
      36 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.); and also the reasons of Steel J.A. in <i>R.
      v. H.</i> <i>(C.R.)</i> (2003), 174 C.C.C. (3d) 67 at paras. 27-30 (Man.
      C.A.), which make the same point. </span></p>

      do not have the benefit of the “tone” of the conversation between the appellant
      and the officers, I think it is preferable for the court to assess the
      appellant’s claim rather than order a new trial. Neither counsel sought
      a new trial, and Crown counsel did not strongly argue that the trial judge’s

      psychological detention, including the necessary degree of compulsion.  I
      have therefore concluded that the appellant was detained contrary to s.&nbsp;9

    him to keep his hands in front of him where Gomes could see them.  As I have
    already said, these words coming from a uniformed officer standing three
    feet away, amounted to a demand, which the appellant was not free to ignore.  From
    the outset, then, Gomes effectively took control of the appellant’s physical

        positions.  Worrell and Forde stood behind Gomes, four to five feet away
        from the appellant.  These three officers – each bigger then the appellant – effectively
        formed a small phalanx blocking the path in which the appellant was walking.  In

lang=EN-US>  Although the appellant did not testify on the motion, his failure
        to do so is not fatal to his claim because the standard for establishing
        compulsion is objective.  The question the court must decide is whether
        the appellant reasonably believed that he was detained: see <i>Moran </i>at
        258-59.  In my view the court can reasonably infer compulsion from the
        appellant’s manner of answering the police’s questions and from the answers
        themselves.  The appellant paced nervously and hesitated before answering
        Gomes’ questions.  Although he did not testify, I infer from his manner
        of responding to the police’s questions that he did not believe he had
        the right to walk away and end the conversation, but rather believed
        that he had no choice but to answer their questions.  Moreover it seems
        to me that the appellant’s belief was objectively reasonable.  In the
        light of his answers, the suggestion that the appellant knew he had the
        right not to incriminate himself seems unreasonable.  I note that at
        no time during the encounter did the officers tell the appellant that
        he was free to go or free not to respond to their questions.</span></p>

      anything illegal. He relies on the judgment of this court in <i>R. v. Young</i> (1997),
      116 C.C.C. (3d) 350. There, at paras. 16-17, Carthy J.A. concluded that
      the police’s request that the accused empty his pockets began an unreasonable
      search, and “presupposed” a detention:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Once it is concluded that the
      search begins with the questioning and that there was no reasonable basis
      for a search then, on the facts of this case, the officer put into motion
      what became an illegal search by simply inviting the appellant to permit
      an intrusion on his person in the form of emptying his pockets. It was
      the same as if the officer had reached out and physically emptied the pockets.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>As to the specific moment when
      there was a detention, the Crown conceded in its factum that it commenced
      with the questioning, and in oral argument switched to reliance on <i>Lawrence</i>, <i>supra</i>,
      as pointing to the time when the appellant was put in the cruiser. The
      appellant did not press illegal detention in his argument, relying rather
      on unreasonable search and seizure, and to the extent detention may have
      any bearing on this analysis it seems sensible to conclude that a search

      divide between questions that begin a search and questions that do not
      is sometimes not easy to draw. In this case, I am not persuaded that the
      police’s question to the appellant “if he had anything that he shouldn’t” began
      a search. In my view, the search began, at the earliest, after the appellant
      admitted to possession of marijuana. At that point, however, the police
      had reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the appellant. Then, when
      in answer to Gomes’ follow-up question “is that it”, the appellant admitted
      to carrying the revolver, the police had the right to search the appellant,
      incident to arresting him. Indeed they had that right even if they did
      not arrest him: see <i>R. v. Polashek</i> (1999), 134 C.C.C. (3d) 187 at

      which Carthy J.A. relied, the question at issue in this case amounted to
      a search. However, here, the police’s question “if he had anything that
      he shouldn’t” differs from the questions in the three cases cited above,
      both in terms of the context in which it was asked, and in the nature of

      asked. In contrast, when Gomes questioned the appellant in this case, he
      did not do so with an already formed intention to conduct a search. This
      is evident from the generality of the question that he asked.  </span></p>

      accused’s pocket and felt a “hard lump”, the accused was asked what was
      in his pocket. In all these cases, the court held that these questions
      began a search. In effect, as Carthy J.A. said, these questions amounted
      to the police’s searching and physically emptying the accused’s pocket

      the Supreme Court of Canada’s judgment in <i>R. v. Stillman</i> (1997),
      113 C.C.C. (3d) 321 tells us that although “real evidence” – such as the
      revolver in this case – may exist independently of any <i>Charter</i> violation,
      it may have a conscriptive quality if it is obtained because of the participation
      of the accused. If it is so obtained, it becomes conscriptive real evidence,
      and if it is not otherwise discoverable, its admission will affect the
      fairness of an accused’s trial. The trial judge failed to undertake this
      analysis mandated by <i>Stillman</i>.</span></p>

      24(2) provides that where “a court concludes that evidence was obtained

      by this <i>Charter</i>, the evidence shall be excluded if it is established
      that, having regard to all the circumstances, the admission of it in the
      proceedings would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.” The
      appellant has established the necessary causal and temporal link between
      the police’s seizure of the loaded revolver and the infringement of his <i>Charter</i> rights.  The

      whether the revolver should have been admitted into or excluded from the
      evidence at trial, turns on the application of the three factors first
      set out in <i>R. v. Collins</i> (1987), 33 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.), and
      reaffirmed in <i>Stillman</i> at para. 69: the effect of admitting the
      evidence on the fairness of the trial; the seriousness of the <i>Charter</i> violation(s);
      and the effect of excluding the evidence on the administration of justice.
      All these factors are directed toward the repute of the justice system
      flowing from the admission or exclusion of the evidence. </span></p>

      v. Law</i> (2002), 160 C.C.C. (3d) 449 at para. 34 (S.C.C.).  The notion
      underlying this first factor is that an accused should not be “conscripted” to
      participate in creating or producing incriminatory evidence. The focus
      of the trial fairness inquiry, therefore, has been on whether the evidence
      in question is conscriptive.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      my view, contrary to the ruling of the trial judge, the revolver in this
      case is  “conscriptive real evidence,” whose admission affected the fairness
      of the appellant’s trial. Conscriptive evidence will ordinarily affect
      the fairness of an accused’s trial, unless it is independently discoverable
      by non-conscriptive means. “Evidence will be conscriptive when an accused,
      in violation of his <i>Charter</i> rights, is compelled to incriminate
      himself at the behest of the state by means of a statement, the use of
      the body or the production of bodily samples,” see <i>Stillman</i> at para.
      80. The word “compelled” has been interpreted broadly to include the participation
      of an accused in the obtaining or creating of the evidence: see, for example, <i>R.
      v. Dolynchuk</i> (2004), 184 C.C.C. (3d) 214 (Man. C.A.). As Cory J. explained
      in <i>Stillman</i> at para. 99, conscriptive real evidence, or as he termed
      it, derivative evidence, is a sub-set of conscriptive evidence:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>A subset of conscriptive evidence
      is “derivative evidence”. This is a term frequently used to describe what
      is essentially conscriptive “real” evidence. It involves a <i>Charter</i> violation
      whereby the accused is conscripted against himself (usually in the form
      of an inculpatory statement) which then leads to the discovery of an item
      of real evidence. In other words, the unlawfully conscripted statement
      of the accused is the necessary cause of the discovery of the real evidence. </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-US>In other words “[e]vidence is derivative evidence if it
      would not have been obtained but for the conscriptive evidence,” see Sopinka
      J. in <i>R. v. Feeney</i> (1997), 115 C.C.C. (3d) 129 at para. 70 (S.C.C.). </span></p>

      this case, the police searched the appellant and found the gun because
      of his inculpatory answer to Gomes’ questions. The appellant gave these
      answers during a detention that was arbitrary and thus in violation of
      his rights under s. 9 of the <i>Charter</i>. The officers testified that
      but for the appellant’s answers, they would not have arrested or physically
      searched him. The appellant’s answers were “conscriptive evidence” and
      the revolver is derivative evidence. As the officers were adamant that
      without the appellant’s inculpatory answers they would not have searched
      him, the Crown cannot establish that the police could have found the revolver
      by non-conscriptive means.  </span></p>

      of s. 9 of the <i>Charter</i> rarely yield conscriptive or derivative evidence
      affecting the fairness of a trial.  The more typical case is a violation
      of s. 10(b) or even s. 8.  However, where, as in this case, the arbitrary
      detention created the context in which the appellant admitted possession

      I do not think that it should, or that it does in this case. I think it
      is fair to say that up until now, trial and provincial appellate courts
      have viewed the Supreme Court of Canada’s jurisprudence on s. 24(2), especially <i>Stillman</i>,
      as standing for the proposition that conscriptive or derivative evidence
      affecting the fairness of the trial will be excluded in all, or virtually
      all, cases without consideration of the other two <i>Collins</i> factors.  </span></p>

      so-called “automatic exclusionary rule”, or near automatic exclusionary
      rule, has been the subject of strong academic criticism and, respectfully,
      does not seem faithful to the language of s. 24(2) itself, which directs
      the court to consider “all the circumstances” bearing on the repute of
      the justice system. More germane to this case, some recent decisions seem
      to signal that the Supreme Court of Canada is willing to moderate the strictness
      with which it has applied the trial fairness factor to exclude evidence
      obtained in violation of a <i>Charter</i> guarantee. Some of the academic

      a pure exclusionary rule for conscriptive evidence:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Our Court has remained mindful
      of the principle that the <i>Charter</i> did not establish a pure exclusionary
      rule.  It attaches considerable importance to the nature of the evidence.
      It is constantly concerned about the potential impact on the fairness of
      a criminal trial of the admission of conscriptive evidence obtained in
      breach of a <i>Charter</i> right. Nevertheless, while this part of the
      analysis is often determinative of the outcome, our Court has not suggested
      that the presence of conscriptive evidence that has been obtained illegally
      is always the end of the matter and that the other stages and factors of
      the process become irrelevant. </span></p>

      seems to me that this passage reflects three important propositions. First,
      the admission of all conscriptive evidence, including derivative evidence,
      will have some impact on trial fairness. Second, if we do not have an automatic
      exclusionary rule for conscriptive evidence, then we must recognize that
      even though the admission of conscriptive evidence compromises trial fairness,
      its admission will not always bring the administration of justice into
      disrepute. And third, whether conscriptive evidence should be admitted
      will depend both on the resulting degree of trial unfairness and on the
      strength of the other two <i>Collins</i> factors. </span></p>

      before considering the other two <i>Collins</i> factors, I will focus on
      the criteria that might be used to assess the impact on trial fairness
      resulting from the admission of conscriptive evidence. Although there may
      be others, two criteria that immediately come to mind are the potential
      effect of the state’s misconduct on the reliability of the evidence, and
      the nature of the police’s conduct that led to the accused’s participation
      in the production or obtaining of the evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      this case, there can be no question about the reliability of the derivative
      evidence. The revolver is reliable evidence. Its admission would not adversely
      affect the truth-seeking function of the trial. Thus, this case differs
      from a case where an accused’s statement obtained in violation of the right
      to counsel under s.10(b) of the <i>Charter</i> raises concerns about the
      reliability of that statement. Here, reliability concerns are absent.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      nature of the police’s conduct that yielded the conscriptive evidence is
      relevant because it is directed to the extent of the state’s interference
      with the accused’s autonomy and with the accused’s freedom of choice whether
      to participate in the creation of self-incriminatory evidence. The more
      invasive the interference, the more serious the impact on trial fairness;
      the less invasive the interference, the less serious the impact on trial
      fairness. <i>R. v. Burlingham</i> (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.) is
      an example – a particularly egregious example – of the former; the present
      case is an example of the latter.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In <i>Burlingham</i>,
      over a prolonged period of time, the police continually questioned the
      accused despite his insistence on his right to counsel, denigrated his
      lawyer, and improperly pressured him into accepting a plea bargain without
      having the opportunity to consult with counsel. The effect was successive
      and severe breaches of the accused’s right to counsel under s. 10(b) of
      the <i>Charter</i>. Eventually, the police induced the accused to tell
      them where the murder weapon was located. The serious impact on trial fairness
      of admitting the conscriptive real evidence, the weapon, was obvious. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Indeed,
      where breaches of s. 10(b) yield conscriptive evidence, the admission of
      that evidence will often have a great impact on trial fairness. One of
      the main purposes of s. 10(b) is to protect an individual’s right against
      self-incrimination. Thus, the denial of the right to counsel strikes at
      the heart of an individual’s decision whether to provide incriminatory
      evidence. If that decision is made without the benefit of counsel, then
      the decision to incriminate oneself invariably will not be an informed
      or voluntary decision. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      contrast to a case such as <i>Burlingham</i>, the present case is not a
      flagrant case of police abuse. The police asked a fairly innocuous set
      of questions. They did not accompany these questions with any overt physical
      threat. They overstepped the bounds of legitimate questioning, but not
      grossly so. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Therefore,
      taken together, the reliability of the evidence and the nature of the police’s
      conduct that led to their obtaining the evidence, suggest that though the
      admission of this evidence would have had some impact on trial fairness,
      that impact would have been at the less serious end of the scale. Put differently,
      in my view, the impact would not have been so great that it precludes consideration
      of the other two <i>Collins</i> factors.     </span></p>

      therefore pass to the second <i>Collins</i> factor, the seriousness of
      the violation.  Unquestionably, the appellant’s s. 9 right is an important <i>Charter</i> guarantee.
      But several considerations diminish the seriousness of the violation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>These
      mitigating considerations include the following. The appellant had a lesser
      expectation of privacy in a public area than he did, for example, in his
      home. The detention was quite brief. The questioning was minimally intrusive.
      The police did not physically restrain the appellant until they arrested
      him after he confessed to carrying the loaded revolver. </span></p>

      most important, the trial judge made no finding that the police acted in
      bad faith, and the record does not support such a finding. Quite the opposite.
      The officers were engaged in proactive policing intending to deter or prevent
      crime in a school neighbourhood “hot spot.” The courts have accepted that
      this is a legitimate police function. The courts have also recognized that
      in carrying out this function, the police are entitled to question any
      citizen without triggering that citizen’s <i>Charter</i> rights. The line
      between police questioning that gives rise to a detention and questioning
      that does not is often not clear. The courts themselves have struggled
      with the dividing line, as I have in this case. As the Supreme Court recognized
      in <i>Mann</i>, at para. 19, a citizen who is asked for identification,
      or even interviewed, is not always detained under s. 9. </span></p>

      I do not think it can be said that, in this case, the police deliberately
      subverted the appellant’s constitutional rights. Perhaps understandably,
      they did not think that they had detained the appellant at all before he
      admitted to possession of marijuana. Moreover, unlike in <i>Clayton</i>,
      the appellant led no evidence to suggest that the police’s violation of
      the appellant’s rights was the result of systematic or institutional failure,
      or inadequate training. All these considerations seem to blunt the seriousness
      of the <i>Charter</i> breaches.</span></p>

      third <i>Collins</i> factor addresses the question whether excluding the
      evidence would have a more serious impact on the repute of the administration
      of justice than admitting it: see <i>R. v. Buhay</i> (2003), 174 C.C.C.
      (3d) 97 at para. 67 (S.C.C.). Here, four considerations favoured admission
      of the evidence: possession of a loaded firearm in a public place is a
      very serious offence, as reflected in the mandatory minimum one-year sentence
      for a conviction under s. 95 or s. 100(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>;
      the appellant was carrying the gun in the vicinity of several schools,
      which aggravated the seriousness of the offence; the evidence was crucial
      to the Crown’s case; and the evidence was entirely reliable. As Doherty
      J.A. said in <i>R. v. Belnavis</i> (1996), 29 O.R. (3d) 321 at 349 (C.A.),
      and approved of in (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 405 at para. 45: “The exclusion
      of reliable evidence essential to the prosecution of a significant criminal
      charge must, in the long term, have some adverse effect on the administration
      of justice.” </span></p>

      important and reliable evidence necessary to sustain a serious charge may
      nonetheless be excluded if its admission would exact too heavy a toll on
      the long- term integrity of the justice system. The kinds of considerations
      where this might be so are absent in this case. We have no evidence to
      suggest that the constitutional breaches were wilful or flagrant, or that
      they reflected institutional indifference to individual rights.</span></p>

      arbitrary detention touches an individual’s rights of autonomy and freedom,
      increasing levels of gun violence in our communities threaten everyone’s
      personal freedom.  In this case, where the police did not grossly overstep
      the bounds of legitimate questioning, acted in good faith, used no force,
      and were patrolling one of Toronto’s high-crime areas, I think that the

      appellant contends that the word “transport” in the definition of “transfer”
    must be given a more restricted meaning because of the associated words rule
    of statutory interpretation (in Latin, <i>noscitur a sociis</i>). This rule
    provides that the meaning of a word in a list is influenced by its association
    with the other words in the list. The common theme in a list of words helps
    to fix the meaning of each and the overall scope of the provision: see, for
    example, <i>R. v. Goulis</i> (1981), 33 O.R. (2d) 55 (C.A.).  Here, the appellant
    points out that most of the words in the definition of transfer – sell, provide,
    barter, give, lend, rent, distribute – require the firearm to change hands.
    So, the appellant contends, the word “transport” should similarly be interpreted
    to mean conveying from one person to another and not just from one place
    to another. </span></p>

      this point in his text <i>The</i> <i>Interpretation of Legislation in Canada</i>,
      3d ed. (Scarborough: Carswell, 2000) at 314:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i><span lang=EN-US>Noscitur a sociis</span></i><span lang=EN-US> helpfully
      draws attention to the fact that a statute’s context can indicate a meaning
      far more restrictive than that found in the dictionary. But its importance
      should not be exaggerated. The interpreter establishes the meaning of a
      text by considering numerous factors, and <i>it may be necessary to ignore
      the restrictive view suggested by the immediate context if a more liberal
      approach is dictated by the legislation’s overall environment</i>. Although
      a good servant, the <i>noscitur a sociis</i> principle may prove to be

      this case, it seems to me that the definition of transfer must be considered
      in a broader context than simply the list of words it encompasses. That
      broader context includes the <i>Firearms Act</i>, S.C. 1995, c. 39, s.
      139. The definition of transfer in s. 84 and the offence in question in
      s. 100 of the <i>Code</i> were enacted as part of the <i>Firearms Act</i>.
      They must be interpreted in the context of that statute and consistently
      with it. If they are so interpreted, then there is no plausible basis to
      give the word “transfer” the restricted meaning argued for by the appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      100(1) of the <i>Code</i> makes it an offence for a person to transfer
      a firearm except as authorized by the <i>Firearms Act</i>. Section 17 of
      the <i>Firearms Act </i>states that the holder of a registration certificate
      for a prohibited firearm may only possess the weapon in his or her dwelling
      house or at a place authorized by a chief firearms officer, unless otherwise
      authorized to transport it under s. 19. In turn, s. 19 of the <i>Firearms</i> <i>Act</i> provides
      that the certificate holder may be authorized to “transport a particular
      prohibited firearm … between two or more specified places for any good
      and sufficient reason,” including a number of reasons that do not involve
      a change of possession of the firearm. Consistent with the meaning of
    “transport” in the <i>Firearms Act</i>, “transport” in the definition of
    “transfer” under s. 84 of the <i>Code</i> should be given its ordinary meaning:
    carrying or moving from one place or person to another. As the Crown points
    out, to limit its meaning as the appellant suggests, would destroy the cohesion
    between the <i>Criminal Code</i> provisions on firearms and the <i>Firearms
    Act.</i></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      appellant’s other argument is that the word “transport” should be interpreted
      consistently with the meaning of that word in drug trafficking legislation.
      Several courts have decided that merely “transporting” drugs from one place
      to another, or “delivering” them to another place for personal use is not
    “trafficking,” see, for example,  <i>R. v. Harrington and Scosky</i>, [1964]
    1 C.C.C. 189 at 193-198 (B.C.C.A.). The marginal notes and headings to ss.
    99 and 100 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> refer to  “weapons trafficking” and  “trafficking
    offences.” The appellant therefore submits that the meaning of “transport” in
    weapons trafficking offences should be interpreted in the same way as it
    is interpreted in drug trafficking legislation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      agree with the Crown that the appellant’s attempt to analogize weapons
      trafficking offences to drug trafficking offences rests on a faulty assumption:
      that Parliament intended to treat the possession of firearms and the possession
      of drugs in the same way. There is no support for this assumption. The <i>Firearms
      Act</i> severely restricts the movement of prohibited firearms in ways
      not found in drug trafficking legislation. A person in lawful possession
      of a prohibited firearm can commit the offence of weapons trafficking by
      knowingly transporting the firearm in contravention of the authorization.
      No similar statutory regime exists for drug offences. Indeed, if Parliament
      had wanted to limit s. 100 to acts where a change of possession occurred,
      it could have made the offence
    “possession … for the purpose of transferring possession of it,” instead
    of the way it does read, “possession … for the purpose of transferring it.” </span></p>

      in my view, the trial judge was correct in giving the word “transport” its
      ordinary meaning. Moving a prohibited firearm from one location to another
      without authorization was one of the acts Parliament intended to prohibit.
      I would not give effect to this ground of appeal. </span></p>

      the principle in <i>R. v. Kienapple</i> (1974), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 524 (S.C.C.).
      He had served 92 days in pre-trial custody, for which the trial judge gave
      him six months’ credit. The trial judge then imposed concurrent sentences
      of twelve months’ imprisonment on each of the four counts, followed by
      three years’
    probation. Two of the counts – possession of a loaded prohibited firearm
    (s. 95(1)) and possession of a firearm for the purpose of transferring it
    (s. 100(1)) – carry a mandatory minimum sentence of one year imprisonment.
    Thus, the trial judge effectively sentenced the appellant to six months above
    the statutory minimum.</span></p>

      then the sentence imposed by the trial judge was not demonstrably unfit.
      I agree. Although the appellant was a youthful first offender, at least
      two aggravating factors warranted increasing the sentence above the minimum:
      the time and location of the offence, and the possession of marijuana.
      The appellant was carrying a loaded weapon in the middle of the day on
      a public street near high schools that were experiencing problems with
      violence. And the trial judge reasonably characterized the possession of
      marijuana and a loaded firearm at the same time as a “deadly type of combination.” I
      would not interfere with the appellant’s sentence. </span></p>

      would dismiss the appellant’s appeal against his convictions. In my view,
      the police arbitrarily detained the appellant. Therefore, the appellant’s
      constitutional right under s. 9 of the <i>Charter</i> was violated. However,
      the admission of the seized evidence – the loaded revolver – would not
      bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The appellant was properly
      convicted of possession of a firearm for the purpose of transferring it
      under s. 100(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> because intentionally moving
      the firearm from one location to another is sufficient to found a conviction.</span></p>
