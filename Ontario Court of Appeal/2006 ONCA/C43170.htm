      Iwasykiw, Peter Jacyk, Louis Matukas and their companies Jedfro Investments
      (U.S.A.) Limited, Prombank International (U.S.A.) Limited and Gramat Investments
      (U.S.A.) Limited were parties to a joint venture agreement to develop and
      sell 273 acres of land near the Denver, Colorado airport. Iwasykiw held
      a 30 per cent interest in the joint venture, Jacyk a 60 per cent interest,
      and Matukas a 10 per cent interest.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      the joint venture began in 1989, Iwasykiw and Jacyk were close friends.
      However, by 1995, their relationship had unravelled over litigation involving
      another of their investments on LakeShore Boulevard in Toronto. The following
      year, the lender for the Denver project, Air Products and Chemicals Inc.,
      precipitated a crisis among the joint venturers by demanding repayment
      of its $3.8 million U.S. loan. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      and Jedfro did not pay their proportionate share of the loan, which was
      $900,000 U.S.. Jacyk, who had the largest interest in the joint venture,
      used another of his companies, Prombank Investment Limited (Prombank Canada),
      to purchase an assignment of the loan. Prombank Canada then foreclosed
      on the Denver lands, and as a result, appropriated the $1.4 million U.S.
      Iwasykiw and Jedfro had invested in the joint venture.</span></p>

      and Jedfro sued the defendants for breach of the joint venture agreement
      and related relief. By the time of trial, both Iwasykiw and Jacyk had died,
      but their estates carried on the litigation. The trial judge dismissed
      the action. Jedfro and Iwasykiw’s estate appealed to this court. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>B. DISCUSSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellants’ principal submission is that the trial judge erred by failing
      to find that the respondents breached the joint venture agreement. The
      agreement expressly provided for remedies in case a joint venturer defaulted
      on its obligations. Under those provisions, a member of the joint venture
      could purchase the interest of the defaulting member, but only on repaying
      the latter’s interest under a formula set out in the agreement. The appellants
      contend that, instead of complying with these default provisions, the respondents
      used a non-arm’s length company (Prombank Canada) to expropriate their
      interest without compensation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge rejected the appellants’ position. She found that no party
      relied on the provisions of the joint venture agreement. The record amply
      supports this finding.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For
      example, Jacyk decided to use one of his companies, which was not a party
      to the joint venture, to pay off the loan and take an assignment of the
      lender’s position. The joint venture agreement did not contemplate what
      Jacyk proposed to do, and eventually did do.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However,
      the appellants also deliberately ignored the terms of the joint venture
      agreement. The following pieces of evidence show that once Air Products
      called its loan, the appellants decided to pursue a strategy of self-interest
      outside the terms of the agreement:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants knew that Jacyk intended to use Prombank Canada to foreclose,
    yet did not object to his doing so.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants could have raised the necessary $900,000 U.S. to pay their proportionate
    share of the loan, either from money they had received on another investment
    or by putting a mortgage on their LakeShore Blvd. property. For whatever
    reason, they chose not to do so. And they never tendered their share of the
    loan.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the same time, they sought to avoid the default provision under the joint
    venture agreement, which they considered too onerous. Instead, they tried
    to make a “side deal” with Jacyk, by offering him security on their LakeShore
    Blvd. property. When Jacyk refused their offer, the appellants did nothing.
    After a suitable period of time had elapsed, Prombank Canada foreclosed.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    no time during this period did the appellants claim to rely on their rights
    or assume their obligations under the agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge summarized her finding that the appellants did not rely on
      the terms of the joint venture agreement and instead tried to make a side
      deal with Jacyk, at para. 39 of her reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The reality is that these three
      individuals, when faced with the crisis precipitated by the demand from
      Air Products, had little regard for the terms of the JVA. I find as a fact
      that Iwasykiw and Matukas were anxious to make a deal with Jacyk that would
      immunize them from the consequences of continued default under the terms
      of the JVA. Matukas made a deal. Iwasykiw did not. He is, as stated in
      the amended statement of defence and counterclaim, the author of his own
      misfortune which is now the misfortune of his estate. These were sophisticated
      businessmen. There was no vulnerability among them. They had known each
      other for a long time. Iwasykiw knew the consequences to his investment
      of foreclosure. Yet, he did not do what he had the capacity to do, i.e.
      raise the $900,000 U.S. to preserve his interest in the Denver Lands. He
      rolled the dice, so to speak. The claims in this action cannot, in law,
      rehabilitate the consequences of the judgment calls that he chose to make
      in a sophisticated commercial context. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      this court, the appellants acknowledged that they tried to work out a deal
      with Jacyk that was different from the bargain they made under the joint
      venture agreement. However, they submitted that having failed to make a
      deal, they were entitled to fall back and rely on the default provisions
      of the joint venture agreement, which would at least entitle them to a
      buyout of their interest.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      do not accept this submission. Where parties act in a way that shows they
      do not intend to comply with or be bound by the terms of their written
      agreement, one party cannot later come to court and ask to have the agreement
      enforced for its benefit. Enforcing the written agreement in these circumstances
      would be contrary to the intention of the parties, as evidenced by their
      conduct. See <i>Shelanu Inc. v. Print Three Franchising</i> <i>Corp</i>.
      (2003), 226 D.L.R. (4th) 577 at 595-6 (Ont. C.A.).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although
      the trial judge did not expressly articulate this legal principle, the
      tenor of her analysis shows, in substance, that she applied that principle
      to deny the appellants’ relief. In my view, she made no error in doing
      so. I therefore would not give effect to the appellants’ main ground of
      appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellants also asserted claims for breach of fiduciary duty, conspiracy
      and bad faith conduct. However, in my opinion, none of these additional
      claims can possibly succeed unless the appellants establish a breach of
      the joint venture agreement. As the appellants have not done so, these
      additional claims must also fail. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      would dismiss the appeal with costs to the Jacyk respondents and the Matukas
      respondents, each in the amount of $25,000 inclusive of disbursements and
      GST. </span></p>
