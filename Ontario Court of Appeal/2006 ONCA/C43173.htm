  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal and cross-appeal
      from the judgment of Justice Mary Anne Sanderson of the Superior Court
      of Justice dated January 26, 2005</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>.</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are three issues on this appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the appellants argue that the trial judge erred by concluding that a binding
    employment agreement was made between the parties in February 2000.  They
    submit, in particular, that the trial judge ignored important evidence relevant
    to whether the agreement alleged by the respondent was made, and that this
    failure fatally tainted the trial judge’s key factual findings regarding
    the agreement and the compensation promised to the respondent.  We disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants concede that the matters said to have been ignored by the trial
    judge in her decision were argued forcefully before her in final argument
    at trial.  We were advised by counsel that they were also the subject of
    written submissions at trial.  In her reasons, the trial judge expressly
    accepted the evidence of the respondent and a witness called by him regarding
    the contested 2000 agreement, and expressly rejected the evidence of the
    appellants’ witnesses.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    these circumstances, we see no error by the trial judge, let alone a palpable
    and overriding error.  The factors identified by the appellants all went
    to the assessment of credibility, a matter squarely within the trial judge’s
    domain.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    to the extent that the appellants also contend that the evidence at trial
    did not support the trial judge’s conclusions regarding the bargain between
    the parties, we think that this contention is unsupportable.  On this record,
    there was evidence lead by the respondent, which, if accepted by the trial
    judge, established the agreement in question.  In the end, this ground of
    appeal is fact driven.  We see no basis for appellate intervention.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellants submit that the trial judge erred by holding, essentially,
    that the respondent discharged his obligation to mitigate his damages.  They
    submit that, acting reasonably, the respondent was obliged after the termination
    of his employment to accept the consulting arrangement then proposed by the
    appellants.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again,
    we disagree.  The terms of the suggested consulting arrangement were vastly
    different than the terms of the respondent’s previous employment.  For example,
    although he had previously been president of the company, the proposed arrangement
    removed the respondent’s corporate authority, reduced his minimum compensation
    by about fifty percent, eliminated his use of an office, and required him,
    when attending meetings with third parties concerning the corporation, to
    be accompanied by one or more of his former subordinates.  Taken together,
    these terms were demeaning to the respondent.  He was not obliged at law
    to accept this materially altered arrangement to satisfy his mitigation obligation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    although the appellants challenged both the notice period and the <i>Wallace</i> damages
    allowed by the trial judge, they acknowledged during oral argument that these
    grounds of appeal were dependent for success upon the success of their first
    ground of appeal.  As they have been unsuccessful on their first ground,
    this challenge also fails.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    for the reasons given, the appeal is dismissed.  The cross-appeal is dismissed
    as abandoned, in accordance with the notice of abandonment that counsel advises
    has been filed.  The respondent is entitled to his costs of the appeal on
    a partial indemnity scale, fixed in the total amount of $20,544 as agreed
    by counsel, inclusive of disbursements and Goods and Services Tax. </p>
