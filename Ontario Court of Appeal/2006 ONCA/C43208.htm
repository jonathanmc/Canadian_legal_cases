    notably, Scepter Corporation (“Scepter”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mills provided services to Scepter on behalf of TSP from the
    time of his engagement by TSP in December 1998 until he joined Scepter on

line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No written contract governed the relationship between TSP and
    Mills. Both parties in their pleadings describe Mills as an independent
    contractor. When TSP learned that Mills had joined Scepter and would be
    providing it with the same services that he had previously provided on behalf
    of TSP, these proceedings were commenced.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In their statement of claim and amended statement of claim,
    the plaintiffs sought damages for breach of fiduciary duty and, in the
    alternative, for breach of confidence.<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a></span>  As the trial judge wrote in her reasons for
    judgment:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[1] The
    plaintiffs sue the defendants, Bill Mills, and Mills Data Select (Mills) for an
    accounting of profits earned due to breach of their contractual agreement,
    fiduciary duties, or alternatively for breach of confidence. At my request
    counsel also addressed the question of whether a duty of good faith was
    applicable in the facts of this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge dismissed the claims for breach of fiduciary
    duty and confidence. She then concluded that the parties were under a mutual
    obligation and duty of good faith in the performance of their contractual
    duties, and that the obligation was breached by the defendants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the alternative, she concluded that if the duty of good
    faith did not apply, Mills’ conduct in moving to Scepter, and thereby
    effectively cutting out TSP, was unconscionable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the further alternative, the trial judge concluded that
    while there was no clear oral contract between the parties dealing with
    proprietary rights to TSP clients, there was an implied term, based on past
    conduct, that Mills would not “secretly” negotiate a deal for himself with TSP
    clients.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In their pleadings, the plaintiffs did not raise the issues of
    any duty of good faith, unconscionability or breach of any implied term of
    their contract with Mills. Apart from an unrelated issue, their action was
    pleaded solely on the basis of breach of fiduciary duty and, in the
    alternative, breach of confidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the case was tried and written submissions had been tendered,
    the trial judge informed counsel that she wished to have their submissions on
    additional issues, not argued, about which she had concerns: this took place on
    the date that had been scheduled for the trial judge to deliver oral reasons
    for judgment. In this regard, it is important to quote in full what the trial
    judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>THE COURT:            I don’t know whether you were given
    a message because I had asked. My secretary was away and I had asked a
    different secretary to be in touch with you to say I would not be giving
    judgment today because I’ve looked into the law, but I wanted to bring you
    people here because I want to give you the opportunity to make some submissions
    in writing.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            It appears to me that clearly the
    fiduciary standard was very directly addressed. The standard of
    unconscionability was, I think, implicitly addressed which was sort of your
    position. I know it wasn’t specifically said. There are three standards of sort
    of care in a contract, and what I think happened is only one was addressed. I would
    like your submissions with respect to the duty of good faith and whether that
    applies and what flows from that and the unconscionability standard.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            As well, it appears from the
    evidence, the argument was made that there was an oral contract and there’s
    obviously a dispute about that, but there’s also, I think, an argument to be
    made that there is an implied contract by conduct and I just want to give
    counsel the opportunity to respond to those issues which appear to me have not
    been squarely raised in a legal perspective. It is my habit, if something comes
    up or cases come up that aren’t canvassed to give counsel an opportunity to
    respond. So I would like to put a timeline on that and I don’t want to make it
    overly onerous.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>MR. MCMURTRY:            Your Honour, may I address the good
    faith and unconscionability? These issues haven’t been raised by the plaintiff.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>THE COURT:            They are being raised by me. I mean
    I think I have to decide what standard of care applies and if the fiduciary
    standard doesn’t apply, then I have to determine what standard does apply and
    what flows from that. I think it’s raised there that fiduciary applies, and
    obviously if fiduciary applies, I don’t need to address the other two. You have
    argued fiduciary doesn’t apply and it appears to me I need to address the duty
    of good faith and the standard of unconscionability and what flows from that,
    both in terms of obligation between the parties but also in terms of remedies.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            Part of the problem was I didn’t
    start thinking about this. The trial happened and the argument happened and
    when I started to think about it and do my work, it just happened very quickly.
    It wasn’t squarely raised by counsel, but I think it’s raised in the issues and
    it’s implicitly raised if the fiduciary standard doesn’t apply, then what does
    apply and what are the consequences of that?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            Nobody has to respond to anything. I
    just want to be candid and put on the table my concerns and give counsel an
    opportunity to respond. So what I suggest is a timeline. The evidence is the same.
    This was mostly about the legal test that applies. It wasn’t really about the
    evidence. There was really very little factual dispute.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Squarely raised on this appeal is the question of the
    propriety of a trial judge raising issues on her own motion and determining
    liability on the basis of those new issues, where those issues were neither
    pleaded nor raised by the plaintiffs.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'><u>THE FACTS</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is little dispute about the facts. In November 1998, a
    mutual friend introduced Mills to Brown, the principal of TSP.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Scepter had been a client of TSP since 1996. Initially Brown
    did work for Scepter, but he was not trained in all of the required
    applications needed by Scepter. Mills had been recommended as possessing the
    necessary expertise for Scepter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Brown and Mills relationship began with a handshake and
    little formality or discussion. On the findings of the trial judge, specific
    formal contractual terms were never discussed. Mills was to perform the work
    required for the TSP clients, including Scepter, for a specified hourly rate,
    keep track of his hours and bill TSP. TSP, in turn, would bill the client using
    its system of pre-paid blocks of time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For four years, Mills worked for one to three days a week at
    the Scepter premises. He had an office there and access to all levels of
    Scepter personnel. During their association, Mills worked primarily for TSP
    but, with the plaintiffs’ knowledge, he also conducted work for others as an
    independent contractor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Scepter was TSP’s largest client and Mills’ most significant
    source of revenue. Mills had complete responsibility for the Scepter account
    and, after Mills’ involvement, Brown had virtually no further contact with
    Scepter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Early on, Mills spoke to Brown about a software application
    that he had developed on his own time and in which Scepter had expressed an
    interest. Brown agreed that Mills could bill Scepter directly for the program,
    and Mills did so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In late 2001 and 2002, problems began to surface at TSP. The
    independent contractors were unhappy with management and clients, too, were
    expressing concern. Two of those clients approached Mills and asked that he
    work directly for them. Mills told Brown of the approaches and that he had
    declined to work for them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During 2001 and 2002, Mills worked on a data imaging system
    program that he had  developed outside
    his working hours, but for which he was billing Scepter directly. He did not
    seek Brown’s permission for this project, and Brown remained unaware of it
    until it was disclosed in the course of this litigation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In July 2002, Scepter expressed its dissatisfaction with TSP
    to Mills and asked him to work directly for Scepter. The negotiations that
    followed resulted in a written agreement between Mills and Scepter dated
    September 1, 2002. On the trial judge’s finding, Mills performed for Scepter
    and provided the same services to it as he had furnished during his contract
    with TSP.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge placed particular reliance on the “conduct” of
    Mills and the plaintiffs, which she found “illustrated the parties’ contractual
    expectations with respect to proprietary rights to the TSP clients”.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'><u>THE DECISION BELOW</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge in her legal analysis concluded that the
    plaintiffs had not proved all the required elements for a fiduciary
    relationship. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge next proceeded to examine at length what she
    described as “the standard of good faith”, ultimately concluding that the
    parties were under a mutual obligation and duty of good faith in the
    performance of their contractual duties and that this obligation had been breached
    by the defendants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence counsel had objected to consideration by the trial
    judge of these issues. In her reasons, the trial judge responded to the
    defendants’ objection in the following language:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[87]            In the defendants’ supplementary
    materials, counsel submits that the plaintiffs did not plead the standard of
    good faith and thus the defendants are unfairly prejudiced. The standard of
    good faith is in essence a lesser included standard of the fiduciary standard.
    The issue of fiduciary standard was before the court. The facts relevant to the
    fiduciary standard are the same facts relevant to the good faith standard. No
    new factual issues arise. Both parties had the opportunity to address good
    faith through supplementary written submissions. Since the standard of care is
    a matter of law, the relevant and evolving law must be applied. In these
    circumstances, any prejudice has been answered by the opportunity to make
    supplementary submissions, and perhaps may be relevant to the question of
    costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Next, the trial judge considered what she described as the
    “unconscionability standard” and concluded as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[94]            If unconscionability is the
    governing standard, then Mills is entitled to protect his own self interest,
    but not in excess, or in an exploitative manner. In my view Mills’ conduct
    crosses the line. He was working directly for the client while retained by TSP.
    The work was major, continued for a year, and was not disclosed to Brown. While
    retained by TSP Mills negotiated the terms of a contract with a TSP client that
    would have the effect of cutting out the plaintiff, with significant advantages
    to Mills. The defendants’ hourly rate doubled. The client too achieved an
    advantage. This was the largest client of TSP, and Mills was aware that the
    loss of the client would be significant for TSP. In my view, this conduct when
    considered through the eyes of a business community in a commercial
    relationship exhibits excessive self-interest and is inherently exploitative.
    It offends all sense of fairness. It is unconscionable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then considered breach of an implied term of a
    contract. In this respect, she concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[99]            Due to the evidence of actual past
    conduct of the parties, it is not necessary to consider the alternative
    reasoning for an implied term of a contract known as the “officious bystander”
    test as described in Fridman, <i>supra</i> at pages 502-503 and cited by
    Justice Iacobucci in <i>M.J.B. Enterprises Ltd. v. Defence Construction (1951)
    Ltd.</i> (1999), 170 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 577 at 588.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[100] In the past
    Mills had sought permission to conduct work directly for Scepter for a
    programme he had developed on his own time. Similarly, in the past Mills had
    advised Brown when a TSP client was disgruntled, and had declined the clients’
    offers to work directly for the client to the detriment of TSP.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[101]            This time Mills did not advise Brown
    with respect to the status of the client. He chose to secretly negotiate a deal
    while performing work on behalf of TSP. This behaviour is in breach of the
    prior pattern of conduct established by the parties as reasonably reflecting
    their intentions.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[102]            Had I not found that the defendants
    were in breach of the obligations of good faith, I would have concluded that
    the defendants were in breach of the implied terms of the contract between the
    parties, based upon their past conduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally the trial judge addressed breach of confidence and
    concluded that such a claim did not fit the facts of this case. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Rodaro v. Royal Bank of Canada </i> (2002), 59 O.R. (3d) 74 (C.A.) at paras.
    59-63, Doherty J.A. noted:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            [59] Mr. Rodaro did not plead that
    RBC’s improper disclosure to Barbican deprived him of the opportunity to
    negotiate a “package deal” involving the sale of the debt and his equity in the
    project. At no time during the months of trial or the course of lengthy
    argument did Mr. Rodaro suggest that the improper disclosure had caused him to
    lose the opportunity described by Spence J. That theory appeared for the first
    time in the reasons of Spence J.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            [60]            It
    is fundamental to the litigation process that lawsuits be decided within the
    boundaries of the pleadings. As Labrosse J.A. said in <i>460635 Ontario Limited
    v. 1002953 Ontario Inc</i>., [1999] O.J. No. 4071 at para. 9 (C.A.) (QL):</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>The parties
    to a legal suit are entitled to have a resolution of their differences on the
    basis of the issues joined in the pleadings. A finding of liability and
    resulting damages against the defendant on a basis that was not pleaded in the
    statement of claim cannot stand. It deprives the defendant of the opportunity
    to address that issue in the evidence at trial …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            [61]            By
    stepping outside of the pleadings and the case as developed by the parties to
    find liability, Spence J. denied RBC and Barbican the right to know the case
    they had to meet and the right to a fair opportunity to meet that case. The
    injection of a novel theory of liability into the case via the reasons for
    judgment was fundamentally unfair to RBC and Barbican.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            [62]            In
    addition to fairness concerns which standing alone would warrant appellate
    intervention, the introduction of a new theory of liability in the reasons for
    judgment also raises concerns about the reliability of that theory. We rely on
    the adversarial process to get at the truth. That process assumes that the
    truth best emerges after a full and vigorous competition amongst the various
    opposing parties. A theory of liability that emerges for the first time in the
    reasons for judgment is never tested in the crucible of the adversarial
    process. We simply do not know how Spence J.’s lost opportunity theory would
    have held up had it been subject to the rigours of the adversarial process. We
    do know, however, that all arguments that were in fact advanced by Mr. Rodaro
    and were therefore subject to the adversarial process were found wanting by
    Spence J.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            [63]            Spence
    J. erred in finding liability on a theory never pleaded and with respect to
    which battle was never joined at trial. This error alone requires reversal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly in <i>A-C-H International Inc. v. Royal Bank of
    Canada</i> (2005), 254 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 327 (Ont. C.A.), Blair J.A.
    wrote at paras. 5-18:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[15]            The trial judge dismissed the
    conspiracy claim, and appears on his own initiative to have shifted the ground
    for liability to a new theory, not pleaded or argued at trial, namely,
    conversion supported by a decision to pierce the corporate veil. In this sense,
    the case is similar to <i>Rodaro v. Royal Bank of Canada</i>, (2002), 59 O.R.
    (3d) 74 (C.A.), a situation in which this Court reversed a trial judge for
    having founded liability on a new theory first raised in his reasons. Speaking
    for a unanimous court in <i>Rodaro</i>, Doherty J.A. affirmed that “it is
    fundamental to the litigation process that lawsuits be decided within the
    boundaries of the pleadings” (para. 60), and pointed out that this notion is
    based on concepts of fairness: a party has the right to know the case it has to
    meet, and to have the opportunity to meet it. He went on to add (at paras.
    62-63) [omitted]:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[16]            Similarly, we do not know how the
    trial judge’s conversion theory would have fared, had it been exposed to the
    rigours of the adversarial process. Believing that the case against him was
    based upon the tort of conspiracy to defraud, as pleaded, Mr. Courtney elected
    to call no defence and to move for a non-suit at the end of the
    cross-claimant’s evidence. Like the bank in the <i>Rodaro</i> case, he
    succeeded on the ground that had been litigated. But the trial judge shifted to
    a new theory that had not been pleaded.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[17]            Had Mr. Courtney and his counsel
    known that they were required to meet a case based on the tort of conversion
    and the court’s equitable jurisdiction to pierce the corporate veil, they might
    well have conducted their preparations for the case, and their handling of the
    case at trial, differently. They might have conducted the cross-examination of
    RBC’s witnesses on a broader basis. They might have decided to call a defence,
    generally. In particular, they might well have decided to call Mr. Courtney in
    his own defence (perhaps to provide the explanation that the trial judge felt
    was necessary in the context of the conversion claim, but that was apparently
    not necessary in the context of the conspiracy claim).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[18]            Because the appellant and his
    counsel did not know they were facing a case about conversion and personal
    liability based on corporate veil principles, they were not in an informed
    position to make the foregoing decisions. As a result, we do not know how these
    theories of liability would have survived, had the battle been joined, as
    Doherty J.A. said in <i>Rodaro</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the alternative theories on which the trial judge found
    liability here did not appear for the first time in her reasons for judgment,
    those theories were only raised by her after the evidence was completed and the
    first round of final written submissions received.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result, these theories were never, as Doherty J.A. put it
    in <i>Rodaro</i>, “[subjected] to the rigours of the adversarial process”. They
    were never pleaded and battle was never joined in respect of them in the trial
    process. In my view, in the particular circumstances of this case, it is no
    answer at this stage of the process that the defendants were afforded the
    opportunity to make further written argument addressing the new liability
    theories raised by the trial judge. The difficulty here is that the parties did
    not frame their lawsuit or conduct the trial on these bases. In the context of
    this case, the defendants were effectively deprived of knowing the case they
    had to meet, and of any opportunity to meet that case throughout the trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs sought damages for breach of fiduciary duty or
    breach of confidence. The trial judge found that the plaintiffs had not met the
    onus of proof in respect of either of those theories.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was not until the trial judge suggested it, that the
    plaintiffs sought to rely on breach of a duty of good faith, unconscionability
    or breach of an implied contractual term. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We cannot know at this stage what evidence the plaintiffs
    might have led at trial in support of those alternative theories anymore than
    we can say what evidence the defendants might have led in response. This fact
    alone raises serious concerns.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Not knowing the case they had to meet and having been denied
    their right to a fair opportunity to meet that case, the defendants have been
    seriously prejudiced and treated unfairly. In finding liability on the bases
    she did, the trial judge committed reversible error. Consequently, in my view,
    the judgment cannot stand and the appeal must be allowed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given my conclusion on this ground, it is unnecessary for me
    to address the appellants’ other grounds of appeal, namely, whether the trial
    judge erred in her conclusions on good faith, unconscionability and implied
    contractual terms.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents ask by way of cross-appeal that the trial
    judgment be varied by findings of this court that:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>1. The trial judge erred in finding that the
    defendants did not owe a fiduciary duty to the plaintiffs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In respect of fiduciary duty, the trial judge noted:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>I have
    difficulty finding that the relationship between the parties illustrates a
    mutual understanding that Mills had relinquished his self-interest and agreed
    to act solely for TSP. I conclude therefore that the plaintiffs have not proved
    all the required elements for a fiduciary relationship.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with this conclusion. It is clear on the facts that
    Mills, to TSP’s knowledge, worked for third parties during his employ. He also
    did some work for Scepter on his own time and for which he billed Scepter
    directly with the blessing of TSP. He was a completely independent contractor
    in his relationship with TSP, and there is nothing special or unusual about
    that relationship that would bring it into the category of a fiduciary.</p>
