  <p><b>On appeal from the decision of Justice Terrance P. O’Connor of the Superior

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>JURIANSZ J.A.:</span></h4>
  <h3><u>Introduction</u></h3>
  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is a Crown appeal from the decision of O’Connor J., staying criminal charges
    against the respondent on the basis that his right to a trial within a reasonable
    time under s. 11(b) of the <i>Charter</i> had been infringed.  The respondent
    was arrested and charged on March 20, 2002.  On November 20, 2003, he was
    committed for trial on a thirteen-count indictment including counts of sexual
    assault, assault, assault causing bodily harm against his wife, uttering
    death threats against his wife and child, possessing and carelessly storing
    restricted firearms, pointing a firearm, and possessing a restricted weapon.  The
    charges were stayed on February 18, 2005, on the basis that there had been
    an unreasonable delay in bringing the matter to trial.  I would allow the
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    dealing with certain preliminary matters, I assess the entire period of delay
    in this case, and attach pivotal significance to the respondent’s decision
    on May 31, 2004, to decline an early trial date.  I conclude that the respondent
    is unable to claim that any of the delay after he refused a trial date should
    be allocated to the Crown or to institutional delay.  Following that, I find
    that the prejudice suffered by the respondent is largely negated by evidence
    that he did not want an early trial date.  Finally, after considering all
    of the foregoing, I conclude that there was no unreasonable delay and this
    appeal must be allowed and the matter remitted for trial.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>Preliminary
        Issues</span></u></h4>
  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent raised three preliminary issues.  </p>
  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the respondent objected to the Crown relying on the preliminary hearing transcript
    in this court, when only a part of that transcript had been filed before
    the trial judge.  The Crown submitted that the preliminary hearing transcripts
    are a necessary part of the record relying on <i>R. v. Allen</i> (1996),
    110 C.C.C. (3d) 331 at 344 (Ont. C.A.), where this court indicated that it
    expects all transcripts of all relevant proceedings to be filed in a s. 11(b)
    case.  Further, in <i>R. v. R. (T.)</i> (2005), 75 O.R. (3d) 645 (C.A.),
    the court considered the transcripts of preliminary hearings that were not
    before the trial judge (see paras. 43-44).  The Crown said that the transcripts
    are relevant to an assessment of the seriousness of the charges against the
    respondent.  In this case the serious nature of the allegations against the
    respondent is abundantly apparent from the bail review proceedings that were
    before the trial judge.  Consequently, it is unnecessary to refer to the
    preliminary hearing transcripts.</p>
  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second<b>,</b> the
    respondent’s counsel submitted that the trial judge’s findings are findings
    of fact deserving of deference, absent palpable or overriding error.  I do
    not agree.  In <i>R. v. Chatwell</i> (1998), 122 C.C.C. (3d) 162 (Ont. C.A.),
    appeal to S.C.C. quashed (1998), 125 C.C.C. (3d) 433 (S.C.C.), this court
    applied the normal standard of review to the assessment of institutional
  delay.  The court said (at para. 10):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>The determination of whether certain factors constitute institutional
    delay for the purpose of an analysis pursuant to s.&nbsp;11(b) of the Charter
    is one which, in our opinion, attracts the normal standard of appellate scrutiny.
    The adjudication of the s. 11(b) rights of an accused is not akin to the
    exercise of judicial discretion.</p>
  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R.
      v. Qureshi</i> (2004), 190 C.C.C. (3d) 453 at para. 27 (Ont. C.A.), Laskin
      J.A. stated that a trial judge’s accounting of the inherent time requirements
      is to be reviewed on a standard of correctness.  In my view, this applies
      to the process of assessing the various periods of delay, ascribing legal
      character to them and allocating them to the various categories set out
      in <i>R. v. Morin</i> (1992), 71 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).  For example,
      whether the Crown had produced documents by a certain date is a question
      of fact.  However, the questions of whether the failure to produce those
      documents constitutes a failure of the Crown’s duty of disclosure and whether
      such failure makes the Crown responsible for ensuing delay, involve the
      application of legal principles.  The questions raised by this appeal primarily
      involve alleged errors in the way the trial judge accounted for various
      time periods, which is reviewable on a standard of correctness. </p>
  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the respondent objected to the Crown taking a different position on some
    of the issues on appeal than it had taken before the trial judge.  However,
    in the course of argument, the respondent conceded that this court should
    not give effect to concessions made by the Crown that were not supported
    by the evidence.  For example, the Crown conceded before the trial judge
    that the respondent had not waived any of the delay, but it is plain on the
    face of the transcript that he did waive a portion of the delay.  In light
    of this concession, this objection is of no consequence to the determination
    of the appeal.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>The Merits</span></u></h4>
  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent concedes that the trial judge made several errors in his analysis
    by:</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber3 align=left style='text-align:left'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>confusing
    inherent delay with institutional delay;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber3 align=left style='text-align:left'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>regarding
    the administrative guidelines stated in <i>Morin</i> as applying to the period
    of total delay rather than to institutional delay; and,</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber3 align=left style='text-align:left'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>calculating
    inherent delay by a process of subtraction rather than by assessing the time
    required by the proceeding itself.  </p>
  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, I would find the trial judge erred in the way he allocated delay
    due to alleged disclosure problems.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>Reasons
        For Delay</span></u></h4>
  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    total delay from the respondent’s arrest on March 20, 2002 to April 9, 2005,
    when it was anticipated the trial date scheduled for March 21, 2005, would
    be completed, is some 36½ months.</p>
  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have divided the total elapsed time into two periods: the period from the
    laying of the charges against the respondent to May 31, 2004, and the time
    that elapsed after May 31, 2004.  This division is appropriate because the
    respondent, on May 31, 2004, declined an early trial date offered to him.  That
    refusal is critical to the analysis of the delay, and significantly changes
    the assessment of the respondent’s unreasonable delay claim.  As stated,
    I would find that none of the delay, after his refusal of an earlier trial
    date, should be attributed to the Crown or to institutional delay.  </p>

  <h5 align=left style='

  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge made no separate determination of the intake period and calculated
      the inherent time requirements by deducting institutional delay and delay
      caused by the defence and Crown from the total delay.  The parties agree
      this is not the correct approach, but</span> dispute how long the intake
      period was for this case.  </p>
  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown submits that the entire period from March 20, 2002 to July 23, 2002,
    should be allowed as the intake period.  The defence submits only two and
    one-half months should be allowed for intake, relying on the trial judge’s
    observation that “[<span lang=EN-US>t]his case is not complex, nor will it
    involve a large number of witnesses, nor will it involve a lengthy trial.”  The
    complexity of the case and the anticipated length of the trial are not necessarily
    the primary determinants of the length of the intake period.  The same holds
    true for the total inherent time of which the intake period is the first
    part.  In <i>Morin</i>, Sopinka J. used a case’s complexity to illustrate
    how the inherent time requirements vary.  However,</span> after observing
    that “[<span lang=EN-US>e]ach case will bring its own set of facts which
    must be evaluated”, he went on to discuss matters that contribute to the
    time inherently required quite apart from the complexity of the trial, “such
    as retention of counsel, bail hearings, police and administrative paperwork,
    disclosure and similar activities.”  Justice Sopinka said (at p. 17) that, </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'><span lang=EN-US>as the number and complexity of these activities increases,
      so does the amount of delay that is reasonable.  Equally, the fewer the
      activities which are necessary and the simpler the form each activity takes,
      the shorter should be the delay.</span></p>
  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    obvious example, unrelated to a case’s complexity, is whether the person
    charged has made an application for legal aid.  In such a case, especially
    where an appeal to the area committee is involved, more time must be allowed
    for the accused to retain counsel.  </p>
  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Judges
      must rely on their knowledge and experience in considering the particular
      facts of the case in deciding how much time to allow for the intake period. </span></p>
  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is noteworthy that in this case the charges against the respondent did not
    arise out of an ongoing police investigation.  Rather, they arose out of
    the urgent complaint of the respondent’s spouse that required the deployment
    of the Emergency Task Force.  The major part of the police investigation
    relating to the domestic assault charges as well as the gun charges had to
    be conducted after the respondent was arrested.  In some cases the investigation,
    taking of statements, paperwork and preparation of disclosure may well be
    underway or completed before the charges are laid.  In this case, these tasks
    all had to be performed after the charges were laid.  For example, the firearms
    seized had to be tested and certificates obtained.</p>
  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Significantly,
    when the parties appeared in court on June 4, 2002, to set a date for the
    pre-trial, it was defence counsel who suggested July 23, 2002 as the return
    date.  When the judge commented that the July 23 date was “a long way off”,
    defence counsel explained that bail variations were still being considered
    and that the respondent was scheduled to have surgery in the interim.  Thus,
    at the time, defence counsel seemed satisfied that an intake matter, finalizing
    the respondent&rsquo;s bail conditions, was still proceeding.  As well, the defence
    had not yet responded to the Crown’s initial disclosure by indicating what
    additional materials it wished.  Defence counsel indicated a request would
    be sent shortly.  That defence response was part of the usual intake process
    required to facilitate a fruitful pre-trial. The defence request was not
    sent until July 22, 2002.  </p>
  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the intake period were found to have ended before then, a portion of the
    delay would have to be assigned to the defence because of its lax approach
    to disclosure and because the respondent was unavailable for an earlier pre-trial
    due to his surgery.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would reject the defence’s submission that there was institutional delay
    before July 23, 2002, and accept the Crown’s position that the intake period
    extended until then.</p>

    defence acknowledges that it caused the adjournment of the pre-trial scheduled
    for July 23, 2002, by failing to send its disclosure request until July 22,
    2002.  The judicial pre-trial was then re-scheduled for August 27, 2002.  The
    defence waived the delay of thirty-five days.</p>

    counsel did not appear on August 27, 2002, as he had to appear in Brampton
    in regard to another proceeding involving the respondent, as did the Crown
    counsel with carriage of this case.  The Crown who did appear indicated that
    defence counsel wished the matter adjourned to October 8, 2002.  I infer
    that defence counsel was faced with a conflict and chose to adjourn this
    matter rather than the other one.  I would attribute the resulting forty-two
    days delay to the defence.</p>

    October 8, 2002, the defence requested that a further judicial pre-trial
    be held.  The defence suggested the date of November 5 or 12, and the matter
    was put over to November 12 because the Crown was not available on November
    5.  The defence acknowledges it is responsible for delay up to November 5,
    but submits the Crown is responsible for seven days between November 5 and
    November 12.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    only seven days are involved and though the Crown did not resist responsibility
    for them, I do not accept the defence’s position.  Sopinka J. noted in <i>Morin</i> <span lang=EN-US>“[</span><span lang=EN-US>a]ccount
    must also be taken of the fact that counsel for the prosecution and the defence
    cannot be expected to devote their time exclusively to one case.”  It follows
    that some reasonable allowance for the schedules of counsel must be made.  In
    my view, the party who causes an adjournment is responsible for the entire
    delay until the matter can be re-scheduled, unless the other party is unavailable
    for an unreasonable length of time.   The Crown, in this case, was available
    promptly.  The defence was not entitled to expect the Crown to be available

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>If an adjournment

    and there should be a frank discussion about how to sole the problem.  The
    focus of the discussion should be on ways to speed up the proceeding.  The
    presiding judge, the trial co-ordinator if necessary, and both counsel should
    attempt quit consciously to schedule the continuation of the preliminary
    hearing- not several months down the road, but at the earliest possible date,
    taking into account the commitments of the presiding judge and counsel.  Then,
    once a continuation date is set, counsel should explicitly state on the record
    their position with respect to the implications of the further delay in a

    disclosure was a factor on January 29, 2004 and again on March 22, 2004,
    when defence counsel refused to set a date for trial because the defence
    had not received all the records it wanted.  Outstanding disclosure was significant
    in the trial judge’s allocation of responsibility for delay.  He initially
    identified a total of eight and one-half months of defence delay.  He then
    reduced the period of defence delay to four months and reallocated the other
    four and one-half months to the Crown because there were outstanding disclosure
    requests on some of the occasions when the defence requested the matter be
    put over.</p>

    respondent submits that the trial judge’s finding that there were outstanding
    disclosure issues is a finding of fact with which this court should not interfere.  He

    disagree.  Where outstanding disclosure is alleged to explain a defence request
    for an adjournment, it is necessary to consider what documents were outstanding,
    when and in what circumstances they were requested, and if their disclosure
    is mandated by the Crown’s constitutional duty of disclosure.  Where the
    defence has made a late request for material with no potential relevance,
    any delay that results should not be attributed to the Crown.  A person charged
    with an offence should not be able to generate a basis for a s. 11(b) application
    by making a continuous stream of requests for materials that have no potential
    relevance, even if the Crown agrees to provide them.  Even when the Crown
    has clearly failed to make mandated disclosure, the defence is not necessarily
    entitled to refuse to proceed to the next step or to set a date for trial.  As
    this court stated in <i>R. v. Kovacs-Tator</i> (2004), 192 C.C.C. (3d) 91
    at para. 47 (Ont. C.A.): “the Crown is not obliged to disclose every last
    bit of evidence before a trial date is set.”  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    examining the outstanding items in light of these considerations, the court
    must decide whether the defence was entitled to refuse to proceed to the
    next step in the process.  If so, the court must still consider whether the
    particular period of delay caused should be allocated to the Crown, as the
    materials may be outstanding because of a late request by the defence.  With
    this in mind, I discuss what occurred on January 29, 2004.</p>

    January 29, 2004, a lengthy and productive pre-trial was held, and the respondent
    was remanded to March 15, 2004, to set a date for trial.  The judge who conducted
    the pre-trial indicated there were some “disclosure matters” to be canvassed.
    He specifically stated he would not describe them as “disclosure issues”.  Crown
    counsel explained that the disclosure matters related to documents not in
    the jurisdiction and to third party records.  She undertook to make inquiries
    about both.  Defence counsel stated that “whether or not the matter is ready
    for trial in March or not will depend upon the outcome of the efforts that
    are made by myself and the Crown between now and March 15.”  Counsel did
    not indicate when the defence had requested these materials.  </p>

    third party records did not raise disclosure issues, and consequently, the
    time necessary for the Crown to obtain them should not be counted as Crown
    delay.  Providing these third party records to the defence was not part of
    the Crown’s constitutionally mandated duty of disclosure.  The Crown undertook
    to obtain the third party records in an effort to assist the defence.  If
    it had not done so, the defence would have had to bring an <i>O’Connor </i>application.  Without
    the Crown’s cooperation, it is likely that more time would have been taken
    to obtain the records.  </p>

    to obtain the documents to assist the defence, then unreasonably delayed
    getting them, consideration might be given to allocating a portion of the
    delay to the Crown.  That did not occur in this case.  The defence at no
    time suggested on the record that the Crown took any longer to obtain the
    records than was reasonably required.  The remarks of defence counsel, if
    anything, indicate that he anticipated the records might not be available
    by the return date of March 15, 2004. </p>

    related to “a return from the Dufferin detachment of the O.P.P.”  The record
    does not indicate what these records were, what their potential relevance
    was to these charges, or when the defence requested them.  The record is
    insufficient to conclude either that they were documents the Crown was obligated
    to disclose or that the Crown delayed in disclosing them.  There is no indication

    s. 11(b) application might be brought.  The respondent’s new counsel, upon
    being retained in May and receiving the file in June 2004, took no steps
    to seek an earlier trial date.  Instead he brought the s. 11(b) application
    relying on the late November 29, 2004 date that had been set to accommodate
    the schedule of his predecessor.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    summarize what happened as follows.  The state offered the respondent a trial
    date in early June 2004, some twenty-six months after he was charged.  Instead,
    he chose to set a trial date at the end of November 2004, some thirty-two
    months after he was charged.  Then, he brought a s. 11(b) application that
    further delayed the trial and argued that the delay to the anticipated completion
    of trial would be approximately thirty-seven months after the charges were
    laid.  </p>
  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent, of course, was entitled to bring the s. 11(b) application.  However,
    the adjournment it caused is attributable to the defence.  It is not a question
    of fault or blame but rather recognition of the reason why the trial was
    adjourned.  As Arbour J.A. said in <i>R. v. Harrison</i>, [1991] O.J. No.
    881 (C.A.) in relation to a defence application to quash a committal to trial: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>The respondent was entitled to move to quash his committals for trial,
    even if these motions required a postponement of the original trial date.  However,
    he must then accept the reasonable delays that occur as a consequence of
    this additional step in the pre-trial process.</p>
  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Of
    the period in excess of eleven months between May 31, 2004 and the anticipated
    end of trial on April 9, 2005, I would allocate nine months to the defence.  Based
    on the Crown’s concession, I would allocate the two remaining months to inherent
    time required to deal with the s. 11(b) application, await the court’s decision,
    and to hold the trial.</p>
  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    neither inherent time nor the defence delay count against the Crown, it is
    apparent that the s. 11(b) clock stopped running when the accused refused
    a trial date in early June 2004.  </p>

      the conclusions of this analysis results in almost fourteen and a half
      months of defence delay, about eight months of inherent time, some five

  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fact that the system could not provide a date for the preliminary hearing
    earlier than twelve months is a matter of obvious concern.  By itself, this
    period exceeds the guideline for institutional delay in the Ontario Court
    of Justice.  The record discloses no unexpected and unusual circumstances
    that would explain this extraordinary delay.  Nevertheless, the s. 11(b)
    analysis does not focus on individual time periods.  The total delay in the
    case must be assessed in determining its reasonableness.    The total period
    of institutional and Crown delay is well within the guidelines’ range of
    sixteen to eighteen months for a case that proceeds through both levels of
    court.</p>
  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    neither party in this case took into account the preparation time required
    by counsel.  As noted above, Sopinka J. in<i> Morin</i> made clear that the
    time counsel require to prepare for trial and the other steps in the proceeding
    is inherently required.  Defence counsel indicated to the court on November
    22, 2004, that he required two weeks to prepare for the s. 11(b) application.  The
    record does not indicate any estimates of counsel as to the preparation time
    required for trial, the preliminary hearing, the judicial pre-trials, the
    bail hearings and the other steps of the proceeding.  I decline to make an
    allowance for preparation time in the absence of indication from counsel
    as to the amount of time spent on the case and when they spent that time.  The
    allowance for preparation time in this case, if one were made, would have
    to be increased because the respondent changed counsel leading to inevitable
    duplication of effort.  Preparation time may have run concurrently with time
    attributed to one of the other categories and would affect the analysis only
    if it reduced Crown or institutional delay.  </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>Prejudice</span></u></h4>
  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that, as a result of his restrictive bail conditions, the
    respondent suffered actual prejudice in this case.  His liberty interests
    were affected by the restrictive bail conditions, his personal relationships
    including those with his children suffered, his reputation was damaged, and
    that his ability to make full answer and defence had been affected because
    his memory had dimmed and face-to-face communication with his counsel was
    difficult given the geographical constraints in his bail.</p>
  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    though the combination of Crown and institutional delay is within the guidelines,
    it is necessary to consider whether the total delay is unreasonable in light
    of the actual prejudice the respondent has experienced.  </p>
  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s findings of prejudice must be understood in context.  The respondent
    was facing three sets of serious criminal charges and was on bail on the
    other charges as well as the charges in this case.  Any prejudice that the
    respondent suffered from restrictive bail conditions, in a sense, arose from
    all the charges he faced.  The same observation may be made about damage
    to his reputation.  His reputation suffered damage from the other charges
    as well.</p>
  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    conditions of the respondent’s bail did not specifically preclude any contact
    with his children, and, after January 2004, placed no restriction on his
    ability to meet with his counsel, as long as he was in the company of a surety.  Therefore,
    his prejudice in these areas also stemmed from his failure to arrange for
    his children to spend time with him in Windsor, his choice of a counsel located
    in Toronto, and the schedule and mobility of his sureties.  </p>
  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    dimming of memory as time passes is unfortunately present in all cases.  The
    respondent is a trained police officer who was facing charges that spanned
    an eighteen-year period.  The prejudice he suffered from the delay in the
    proceeding relates only to the dimming of memory after he was charged.</p>
  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    final contextual observation relevant to assessing the level of the respondent’s
    prejudice is the fact that he did little or nothing to move his case forward
    to an early trial.  In <i>Morin</i>, Sopinka J. stated that where the evidence
    establishes that “the accused is in the majority group who do not want an
    early trial and that the delay benefited rather than prejudiced the accused”,
    then conduct “falling short of waiver may be relied upon to negative prejudice.”  He
    stated this principle after observing that many, and perhaps even most, accused
    are not anxious to have an early trial.  Sopinka J. quoted Doherty J. who
    wrote in a paper given to the National Criminal Law Programme in July 1989: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>an accused is often not interested in exercising the right bestowed on
    him by s. 11(b).  His interest lies in having the right infringed by the
    prosecution so that he can escape a trial on the merits.  This view may seem
    harsh but experience supports its validity.</p>
  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sopinka
    J. cautioned that the s. 11(b) right “must be interpreted in a manner which
    recognizes the abuse which may be invoked by some accused”.</p>
  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence in this case clearly establishes that the accused did nothing to
    move his case forward to trial in a timely way.  Many of his failings in
    this regard are apparent from the foregoing analysis of the chronology of
    the proceeding.  On June 4, 2002, he requested a remand to a date “a long
    way off.”  On July 23, 2002, the failure of the defence to send a letter
    requesting disclosure caused an adjournment.  On November 12, 2002 and March
    15, 2004, agents who were not fully prepared to deal with the matter appeared
    on behalf of defence counsel.  On December 8, 2003, and March 15, 2004, the
    respondent did not act upon the court’s encouragement to seek special dates.  Most
    important is the fact he declined to accept an early trial date offered by
    the system.  </p>
  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is a further matter arising out of the respondent’s refusal on May 31, 2004
    to accept the June 2004 trial date.  The affidavits filed on his behalf indicate
    that the respondent’s first counsel was discharged in May 2004 and his subsequent
    counsel was retained in May 2004.  It would seem that, on May 31, 2004, the
    respondent declined to set an early trial date purportedly because of his
    first counsel's unavailability, when it would seem he knew that his first
    counsel’s calendar was irrelevant in setting the trial date.  His failure
    to disclose to his first counsel and to the court the fact that he had already
    retained new counsel leads to the conclusion he had no interest in an early
    a trial date.  If there is some explanation of the timing set out in the
    affidavits that would counter this inference, respondent’s counsel on the
    appeal could not provide it.</p>

line-height:normal;'>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the respondent’s new trial counsel, upon being retained in May 2004, made
    no attempt to reschedule the trial from the late date that had been set because
    of the first counsel’s busy schedule.  The respondent’s new counsel took
    no steps to move the file forward until September 2004.</p>
  <p class=numberedparagraphs align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would conclude that the prejudice suffered by the respondent is largely negated
    by evidence that he did not want an early trial date.  Given this conclusion,
    the prejudice he has suffered must be accorded little or no weight.</p>
