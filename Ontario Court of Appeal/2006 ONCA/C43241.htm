  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment of
    Justice Michael R. Dambrot of the Superior Court of Justice, dated March 9,
    2005 made at Toronto, Ontario.</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>LASKIN J.A.:</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>A. OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The broad
    question on this appeal is which of two innocent parties – the appellant
    tenant, The TDL Group Ltd., or the respondent mortgagee, 473807 Ontario Limited
    – should suffer because of the irresponsible conduct of an impecunious
    landlord/mortgagor. The specific question is whether the terms of a
    postponement and non-disturbance agreement made between the tenant and the
    mortgagee permit the tenant to set off, against rent owing to the mortgagee
    under a lease, the amount of a judgment the tenant had obtained against the
    landlord.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These are
    the bare facts. The tenant leased property from the landlord. The landlord then
    mortgaged the property, and gave the mortgagee an assignment of rents as
    collateral security for the mortgage. The tenant and the mortgagee signed a
    postponement and non-disturbance agreement: the tenant agreed to postpone its
    lease to the mortgage; the mortgagee agreed that if it went into possession, it
    would take over the landlord’s interest in the lease and would not interfere
    with the tenant’s rights under the lease.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The tenant
    successfully sued the landlord for damages for breach of the lease and costs.
    The court ordered that the tenant was entitled to set-off its damages and costs
    award against its rent. The landlord defaulted on the mortgage. The mortgagee
    went into possession. The tenant claimed that it could apply its court ordered
    set off against the rent payable to the mortgagee. The mortgagee resisted. The
    postponement and non-disturbance agreement does not specifically mention set-off.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On an
    application to determine the rights of the tenant and the mortgagee, the motion
    judge found for the mortgagee. He concluded that the postponement and
    non-disturbance agreement did not explicitly or implicitly preserve the
    tenant’s right of set-off and therefore the tenant could not apply its court
    ordered set-off against its rent. The motion judge concluded in the
    alternative, that the mortgagee was not bound by the set-off because it was not
    a party to and did not have notice of the tenant’s litigation with the
    landlord. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The tenant
    TDL appeals. Its appeal raises two issues: first, do the terms of the
    postponement and non-disturbance agreement entitle TDL to set-off against its
    rent payable to the mortgagee the amount of its judgment against the Landlord;
    and, second, is TDL’s judgment against the landlord binding on the mortgagee,
    though the mortgagee was not a party to that litigation? For the reasons that
    follow, I would answer yes to both questions. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>B. BACKGROUND FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    motion judge has admirably and succinctly set out the relevant facts, none of
    which are disputed. Here, I will summarize only those facts necessary for my
    decision.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>a. The lease between the TDL
    Group Ltd. and 1158631 Ontario Limited.</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>1158631
    Ontario Limited. (“the Landlord”) owned one acre of land on the south side of
    Highway 7 in Markham, Ontario. By an agreement made in June 1998, The TDL Group
    Ltd. leased a part of this land from the Landlord. TDL is the franchisor of the
    national brand “Tim Hortons” and, through franchisees, it operates the chain of
    Tim Hortons restaurants. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    original lease was amended by an agreement dated April 27, 1999, under which
    TDL, at its own expense, built a large Tim Hortons restaurant and
    drive-through. The lease was registered on title. The restaurant opened for
    business in January 2000. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    lease as amended (“the Lease”) has a 20-year term, and TDL has an option to
    renew for a further five years. Rent for the first five years of the Lease was
    fixed at $25,000 annually. The Lease stipulated that rent increased by $5,000
    annually in succeeding five-year periods. Thus, for the last five years of the
    Lease (years 16-20), the rent will be $40,000 a year.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section
    2.01 of the Lease provides that rent is to be paid “without any set off” except
    as provided in s. 13.01. If the Landlord defaults in performing one of its
    covenants under the Lease, s. 13.01 gives TDL the right to cure the default and
    set off against rent the expenses incurred in doing so. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Under
    s. 6.06 of the Lease, the Landlord must indemnify TDL for any losses, damages
    and costs arising out of the Landlord’s breach or failure to perform its
    obligations under the Lease. However, the Lease does not appear to give TDL a
    right of set off where the Landlord is liable for damages under s. 6.06. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section
    20.01 of the Lease is headed “conditions”. Section 21.01(e) requires, as a
    condition of the Lease, that the Landlord obtain a non-disturbance agreement
    for its tenants from its mortgagees.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>b. The mortgage between the
    Landlord and 473807 Ontario Limited</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In November 1999, 473807 Ontario Limited (“the Mortgagee”)
    loaned the Landlord $475,000 and took back a first mortgage on the land as
    security. As further security for its loan, the Mortgagee took an assignment of
    rents, entitling it to collect rent from the Landlord’s tenants if the Landlord
    defaulted under the mortgage. In the assignment of rents, the Landlord
    covenanted as assignor to “observe and perform all of its obligations under the
    leases.” Both the mortgage and the assignment of rents were registered on
    title.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>c. The postponement and
    non-disturbance agreement</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Contemporaneously
    with the mortgage, and as contemplated by the Lease, TDL and the Mortgagee
    entered into a postponement and non-disturbance agreement (“PNDA”). TDL drafted
    the PNDA, and it was signed without negotiation. The terms of the PNDA are
    crucial to the outcome of this appeal, and I will refer to them in detail when
    I discuss the legal issues.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    general terms, TDL agreed to postpone its Lease to the mortgage. In return, the
    Mortgagee agreed that if it enforced its security, and TDL was not in default,
    TDL could remain in possession and carry on business under the terms and
    conditions of the Lease. TDL agreed to promptly attorn to the Mortgagee, and
    the Mortgagee agreed to be bound as the landlord under the Lease.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a> </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>d. TDL’s damages action against
    the Landlord</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    April 25, 2000, without justification, the Landlord posted a termination notice
    on the door of the restaurant, evicted everyone inside, and sought to close
    down the business. The next day, TDL and its franchisee obtained an order
    returning possession of the premises to them, and directing the Landlord to
    honour its covenant to provide TDL with quiet enjoyment. TDL then sued the
    Landlord – aptly described by counsel as “the landlord from hell” – for breach
    of the Lease, trespass, interference with economic relations and defamation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    action was tried before Blenus Wright J. in early 2003. He found the Landlord
    liable on the claims asserted by TDL and its franchisee and assessed damages at
    $62,487.30, including $10,000 in punitive damages. He also awarded TDL and its
    franchisee substantial indemnity costs, which were later assessed at
    $644,922.91, an amount the motion judge termed “astounding”. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Significantly
    for the present appeal, Blenus Wright J. concluded that “the facts of this case
    support a legal and equitable set-off”. His formal judgment included a
    paragraph entitling TDL to set off against rent and other monies due to the
    Landlord under the Lease, the amount of the damages award together with costs,
    a sum of approximately $707,000. The Landlord appealed Blenus Wright J.’s
    judgment but did not challenge TDL’s right of set off. This court dismissed the
    appeal. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>e. The Mortgagee goes into
    possession</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    November 2003, the Landlord defaulted on its mortgage.  In February 2004, the Mortgagee issued a
    notice of sale. The Mortgagee also gave notice to TDL that it had succeeded to
    the interest of the Landlord under the Lease and that TDL was obliged to pay it
    rent in accordance with the assignment of rents. But TDL took the position that
    the judgment of Blenus Wright J. entitled it to set off against rent otherwise
    owing to the Mortgagee, the $707,000 in damages and costs awarded against the
    Landlord. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    June 2004, the Mortgagee obtained an order for possession and went into
    possession of the premises. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>f. The litigation between TDL
    and the Mortgagee</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Once
    the Mortgagee went into possession under the terms of the PNDA, TDL and the
    Mortgagee came into privity of contract. The Mortgagee then contended that the
    PNDA gave it the right to attorn rent without giving effect to TDL’s right of
    set-off against the Landlord. TDL contended that, though it did not respond to
    the attornment, it was not in default under the Lease because of its right of
    set-off, and, therefore, it was entitled to remain in possession of the leased
    premises.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To
    resolve the dispute the Mortgagee brought an application for a declaration that
    TDL was obliged to pay rent in accordance with the Lease and that TDL could not
    set off its judgment against the Landlord against that rent. The motion judge
    granted both declarations.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>C. DISCUSSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As I
    said earlier, this appeal raises two issues: first, does the PNDA entitle TDL
    to set off against its rent payable to the Mortgagee the amount of its judgment
    against the Landlord; and second, is TDL’s judgment against the Landlord
    binding on the Mortgagee?</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>First Issue: Does the PNDA
    entitle TDL to set off against its rent payable to the Mortgagee the amount of
    its judgment against the Landlord?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    motion judge concluded that TDL was not entitled to set off its judgment
    against the rent payable to the Mortgagee. He held that the state of accounts
    between the Landlord and TDL would be incorporated into the tenancy between TDL
    and the Mortgagee, only if the PNDA so provided, either explicitly or
    implicitly. And he held that the PNDA did not so provide. In other words, he
    concluded that the Mortgagee and TDL began their leasehold relationship with a
    “clean slate.”</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>a. The positions of the parties</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    this court, the Mortgagee advanced three main arguments in support of the
    motion judge’s decision. First, it argued that the motion judge’s “clean slate”
    approach was correct.  According to the
    Mortgagee, the PNDA created a new lease between TDL and the Mortgagee, a lease
    that incorporated by reference the terms of the existing lease between TDL and
    the Landlord, and that came into existence when the Mortgagee took possession
    of the premises under its mortgage security. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
    the Mortgagee argued that the court should not interpret the PNDA literally
    when doing so would not yield a sensible commercial result. Interpreting the
    PNDA to give TDL a right of set-off, the Mortgagee contended, would be
    commercially unrealistic. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally,
    and in the alternative, the Mortgagee argued that the PNDA was ambiguous on
    whether TDL was entitled to set off its judgment against its rent. The
    Mortgagee then contended that because TDL was a sophisticated party that
    insisted on using its own form of a postponement and non-disturbance agreement,
    the court should apply the <i>contra proferentum</i> rule and construe the
    ambiguity against TDL’s position.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    support of its appeal, TDL also put forward three arguments. Its main argument
    was that the motion judge’s “clean slate” approach is wrong in law and contrary
    to the unambiguous terms of the PNDA. TDL contended that the PNDA created
    privity of contract between it and the Mortgagee and that by its terms, the
    Mortgagee simply took over the Landlord’s position under the Lease. Thus,
    absent an agreement to the contrary, the Mortgagee was bound by the state of
    accounts between TDL and the Landlord, which included TDL’s right of set-off.
    In short, the Mortgagee took over the Lease “subject to the equities”. And far
    from amounting to an agreement to the contrary, the terms of the PNDA confirmed
    that TDL’s right of set-off was preserved. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
    TDL argued that the PNDA created privity of estate between it and the
    Mortgagee. As the Landlord’s covenants, whose breach gave rise to TDL’s
    equitable set-off, like the tenant’s covenant to pay rent, ran with the land,
    they were binding on the Mortgagee. Moreover, TDL contended that the cases the
    motion judge relied on to support his clean slate theory do not assist the
    Mortgagee because they concern personal covenants of the Landlord, not, as
    here, covenants that ran with the land. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third,
    TDL argued that its position is commercially sensible and that the Mortgagee
    simply failed to protect itself by either obtaining an estoppel certificate or
    an appropriately worded PNDA.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Despite
    their competing positions, both counsel recognized, as indeed did the motion
    judge, that the rights and obligations of TDL and the Mortgagee are governed by
    the terms of the PNDA, to which I now turn.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>b. The PNDA</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because the PNDA dictates the outcome of this appeal, I set it
    out below in its entirety. I have underlined the parts that I consider

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is a case of contract interpretation. It turns on the
    interpretation of the PNDA. As I interpret the PNDA, the parties intended that
    when the Mortgagee went into possession, the Mortgagee would take over the
    Landlord’s position under the Lease, and TDL would be in the same position as
    it was when the Landlord was the lessor. Thus, in my view, the parties intended
    that when the Mortgagee took over the Landlord’s position, apart from any
    prepayment of rent, the Mortgagee would assume the state of accounts between the
    Landlord and TDL. That state of accounts included TDL’s right to set off its
    judgment for damages and costs against its rent. This interpretation gives
    effect to the words of the PNDA, is consistent with the law of assignment, and
    reflects commercial practice.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>i. The interpretation of the
    PNDA</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The basic goal of contract interpretation is to ascertain the
    intent of the parties at the time they entered into the contract. Ordinarily,
    the parties’ intent is determined by the words of the contract, viewed in the
    light of relevant surrounding circumstances.  See <i>Eli Lilly and Co. v. Novopharm Ltd.</i>, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 129 at
    para. 54. I therefore propose to examine the words of the PNDA. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The PNDA created privity of contract between the Mortgagee and
    TDL, a privity that did not otherwise exist. Under s. 4, once the Mortgagee
    went into possession, the PNDA established a landlord and tenant relationship
    between the Mortgagee and TDL.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The core bargain struck under the PNDA was TDL’s agreement to
    postpone its Lease to the mortgage (that is to give the mortgage priority over
    the Lease (s. 1)) in return for the Mortgagee’s agreement to give TDL security
    of tenure (s. 3.1). As long as TDL paid the rent required by the Lease, the
    Mortgagee would not disturb TDL’s possession of the premises. The postponement
    provision of the PNDA reordered priorities, but did not otherwise affect the
    rights and obligations of the Mortgagee and TDL. Those rights and obligations
    depend on the other terms of the PNDA. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The other terms of the PNDA show that when the Mortgagee went
    into possession, it would step into the Landlord’s shoes and assume the
    Landlord’s obligations under the Lease.  These obligations included recognizing TDL’s court-ordered right of
    set-off. TDL was to be no worse off in a tenancy relationship with the
    Mortgagee than it was under its tenancy with the Landlord. That this was the
    parties’ intent is demonstrated by the following provisions of the PNDA:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The PNDA refers to the “Lease” (first recital).  The “Lease” is a defined term.  It means the lease agreement between the
    Landlord and TDL.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Mortgagee’s act of going into possession created a
    landlord-tenant relationship between it and TDL (s. 4).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Mortgagee agreed to be “bound as the landlord under
    the Lease” (s. 2). In other words, the Mortgagee agreed to accept the
    Landlord’s obligations under the Lease. One binding obligation of the Landlord
    was to recognize TDL’s court ordered set-off.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Once the Mortgagee agreed to be bound as the landlord,
    TDL agreed to “attorn” to the Mortgagee, that is to recognize the Mortgagee as
    its landlord (s. 2); and TDL also agreed to become the Mortgagee’s tenant under
    the Lease, “upon all terms and conditions of the Lease.”  One term of the Lease is TDL’s obligation to
    pay the stipulated rent.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Mortgagee agreed that if it enforced its security,
    as long as TDL was not in default, TDL could remain in possession under the
    terms of the Lease (s. 3.1).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>TDL’s obligation to pay rent to the Mortgagee was
    triggered by the Mortgagee’s notice that it had “succeeded to the interest of
    the Landlord under the Lease”. (s.&nbsp;3.2). The Landlord’s interest under the
    Lease was encumbered by TDL’s court-ordered right of set off.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The parties agreed that the Mortgagee would not be
    liable for any rent TDL had prepaid to the Landlord (s.&nbsp;5). Section 5 is
    relevant to the parties’ intent in two ways. First, it is a strong indicator
    that the Mortgagee agreed to assume the state of accounts between the Landlord
    and TDL. If it did not agree to do so, s. 5 would have been unnecessary. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, s. 5 invokes the principle of interpretation
    “to express one thing is to exclude another” (<i>expressio unius est exclusio
    alterius</i>). In other words, by exempting prepayment of rents from the state
    of accounts taken over by the Mortgagee, the parties must have intended not to
    exempt any other items. See John D. McCamus, <i>The Law of Contracts</i> (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc., 2005) at 726.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Professor McCamus
    makes the valid point that this principle should be applied cautiously because
    a missing reference may be an accidental omission. However, postponement and
    non-disturbance agreements are commonly used in the field of commercial real
    property. The PNDA, itself, was agreed to by two commercial lawyers. In this
    context, I do not see any room to argue that the absence of a provision,
    similar to s. 5, for set-off was accidental, even though the amount of the
    set-off was undoubtedly unanticipated. Nor, in the light of the specific
    reference to prepayment of rent, do I see any room to argue that the parties
    implicitly intended to exclude set-off from the state of accounts. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, I conclude that under the PNDA, the Mortgagee agreed to
    take over the Landlord’s position under the Lease and to assume responsibility
    for whatever set-off rights TDL acquired against the Landlord. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge stopped short of saying that when the
    Mortgagee went into possession, a new lease came into effect. He seemed to
    accept implicitly what I have said explicitly: the Mortgagee stepped into the
    position of the Landlord under the original Lease. However, we differ in the
    effect of the Mortgagee’s having done so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge concluded that the Mortgagee and TDL began
    with a clean slate because TDL’s right of set-off was not incorporated,
    expressly or implicitly, into their leasehold relationship. Respectfully, the
    motion judge did not give effect to the words of the PNDA and especially did
    not give effect to s. 5.  In my view,
    the words of the PNDA, require a conclusion opposite to that of the motion
    judge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge supported his conclusion by reference to
    three cases, which he fairly conceded were not “on all fours”, but which he
    thought supported his underlying “clean slate” approach. I do not consider
    these cases relevant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The three cases are: <i>Chiappino v. Bishop</i> (1988), 49
    R.P.R. 218 (Ont. Dist. Ct.); <i>Devon Estates Ltd. v. Royal Trust Co</i>.
    (1994), 24 Alta. L.R. (3d) 401 (Q.B.); and <i>Dollar Land Corp. Ltd. v. Solomon</i>,
    [1963] 2 O.R. 269 (Ont. H. C.). In each case, the tenant had made a prepayment
    of one kind or another to a predecessor landlord. The tenant then sought
    recovery of the prepayment from a successor landlord. In each case, recovery
    was denied. In none of the three cases, however, did privity of contract exist
    between the tenant and the successor landlord. Thus, the successor landlord
    would be liable for the prepayment only if there was privity of estate between
    it and the tenant, and the original landlord’s covenant to repay “ran with the
    land.” See R.E. Megarry and H.W.R. Wade, <i>The Law of Real Property</i> (London:
    Sweet &amp; Maxwell Ltd., 2000) at para. 15-004.  In each case, the court held that the landlord’s covenant to
    repay was a personal covenant and did not run with the land. Thus, the
    successor landlord had no obligation to make the repayment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None of the three cases relied on by the motion judge turns on
    contractual rights and obligations, because, unlike the present case, in those
    three cases there was no privity of contract between the tenant and the
    successor landlord. I note in passing, however, that the result in those three
    cases was specifically addressed in s. 5 of the PNDA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I add that TDL did seek to distinguish the three cases relied
    on by the motion judge. TDL did so in support of its alternative argument that
    it and the Mortgagee were in privity of estate, and that the right to set off
    against rent arising from the Landlord’s breach of the Lease ran with the land.
    Thus, on this alternative basis, TDL contended that its court-ordered set-off
    was binding on the Mortgagee. I need not address this alternative argument
    because TDL and the Mortgagee are bound by a contract, the PNDA, and their
    rights and obligations are determined by that contract.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Mortgagee went a step further than the motion judge and
    submitted that the PNDA created a new lease between it and TDL, which simply
    incorporated the terms and conditions of TDL’s Lease with the Landlord. Because
    the parties had a new lease, the Mortgagee submitted that it did not inherit
    the state of accounts between TDL and the Landlord under their Lease.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the plain words of the PNDA contradict the
    Mortgagee’s submission. The lease that the Mortgagee agreed to be bound by and
    under which it succeeded to the interest of the Landlord is a defined term in
    the PNDA: it is the “Lease” made between TDL and the Landlord. The PNDA did not
    create a new lease. Rather, it stipulated that the Mortgagee took over the
    Landlord’s position – or in other words, substituted for the Landlord – under
    the previously negotiated Lease. Also, I return to the importance of s. 5 of
    the PNDA.  If the PNDA had created a new
    lease, then s. 5 would have been unnecessary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Mortgagee contended that its “new lease” argument is
    supported by the reasons of McKinlay J.A. in the important case of <i>Goodyear</i> <i>Canada Inc. v. Burnhamthorpe Square Inc.</i> (1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 321
    (C.A.). <i>Goodyear</i>, however, does not assist the Mortgagee. In <i>Goodyear</i>,
    a mortgage had priority over a lease entered into between the mortgagor and the
    tenant. This court held that when the mortgagee went into possession, it could
    not enforce the lease against the tenant. Even though the mortgagee had an
    assignment of lease and an assignment of rent, these assignments were given
    only as security for the mortgage debt. They did not create privity of contract
    between the mortgagee and the tenant. The mortgagee took the assignments but
    never accepted the obligations of the existing lease. If, however, the
    mortgagee in possession demanded rent from the tenant, and the tenant paid
    rent, then these acts established a new year-to-year tenancy between the
    mortgagee and the tenant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under the PNDA, TDL agreed to postpone its Lease to the
    mortgage. Thus, like the mortgage in <i>Goodyear</i>, the mortgage here took
    priority over the Lease. But there the similarities end. What was missing in <i>Goodyear</i>,
    and what is present here, is privity of contract between the mortgagee and the
    tenant. Because in <i>Goodyear</i> there was no privity of contract, the
    parties effectively created a new lease by the acts of demanding and paying
    rent. McKinlay J.A. observed, however, at 337 that “the normal practice is for
    the parties to enter into non-disturbance agreements” and that these agreements
    do create privity of contract.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the present case, the Mortgagee and TDL followed this
    normal practice and under the PNDA they signed, the Mortgagee agreed to accept
    the Landlord’s obligations under the Lease if it went into possession. For
    these reasons, I do not accept the Mortgagee’s argument that the PNDA created a
    new lease and established a new state of accounts.</p>

    the ground that it is contrary to the law of assignment. In the annotators’
    view, the Mortgagee was an assignee of the Landlord’s interest in the Lease,
    and thus bound by the rule that absent an agreement to the contrary, the
    assignee “takes subject to the equities”. As the PNDA did not exclude TDL’s
    court-ordered set-off, that set-off was one of the “equities” that the
    Mortgagee was required to assume.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

    fairness to the motion judge, it does not appear that the law of assignment was
    argued before him. Moreover, I do not think that the Landlord assigned the
    Lease to the Mortgagee.  The Landlord
    did not give the Mortgagee an assignment of the Lease. And even if it had done
    so, it would not have been an absolute assignment because the Landlord still
    retained the equity of redemption. See <i>Goodyear</i>, <i>supra</i>. The PNDA
    is not an assignment of the Lease.  It does
    not say that it is, and more importantly, the Landlord did not sign it.  The term of the Lease requiring the Landlord
    to obtain a non-disturbance agreement from its Mortgagee also does not
    constitute an assignment.  The Landlord
    did give the Mortgagee an assignment of rents, but only as security for the
    mortgage debt.  Moreover, the assignment
    of rents cannot constitute an assignment of the Lease because in taking the
    assignment of rents, the Mortgagee did not agree to assume the Landlord’s
    obligations under the Lease. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Thus,
    there is no document or act by which the Landlord assigned and the Mortgagee
    accepted the Landlord’s rights and its obligations under the Lease. Instead, it
    was under the PNDA that the Mortgagee agreed to assume the Landlord’s obligations.  And the PNDA is not an agreement between the
    Landlord and the Mortgagee, but an agreement between TDL and the
    Mortgagee.  See the excellent article on
    assignments by Craig R. Carter, “Assignments of Contracts, Novation and
    Privity” in <i>Law Society of Upper Canada Special Lectures 2002</i> Real
    Property Law: Conquering the Complexities (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc., 2003)

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, I think that the law of assignment is
    relevant.  The Landlord did assign the
    rents to the Mortgagee.  And the
    Mortgagee relied on its assignment of rents to claim rent from TDL.  Although the Mortgagee did not agree in the
    assignment of rents to accept the Landlord’s obligation under the Lease, it did
    agree to do so in the PNDA.  Therefore,
    by the assignment of rents and the PNDA, the Mortgagee became the Landlord’s
    assignee, or at least assumed a position identical to that of an assignee.  An assignment substitutes a new party –
    creditor or debtor – for one of the original parties to the contract. See
    G.H.L. Fridman, <i>The Law of Contract in Canada, 4th ed.</i> (Toronto: Thomson
    Canada Limited, 1999) at 710.  Here, the
    Mortgagee stepped into the Landlord’s shoes or substituted for the Landlord
    under the Lease.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore, my interpretation of the PNDA is consistent with
    the rule governing assignments. This rule states that unless there is an
    agreement to the contrary, an assignee takes subject to all the equities that
    have accrued at the time the debtor has notice of the assignment.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

    his text, <i>The Law of Contracts</i>, 5th ed. (Aurora, ON: Canada Law Book,
    2005) at para. 278, the rule that an assignee takes subject to all equities is
    based on the rationale that “[w]here one of two innocent parties must suffer
    for the default of the assignor, the law protects the obligor.” </p>

lang=EN-US>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the context of this case, the PNDA itself would
    constitute “notice” to TDL (the debtor) that the Mortgagee (creditor) was stepping
    into the shoes of the Landlord. TDL agreed to the Mortgagee doing so. By that
    time, however, TDL had a court-ordered right of set-off against rent payable to
    the Landlord. Unless TDL and the Mortgagee agreed otherwise, TDL was entitled
    to assert that right of set-off against its rent payable to the Mortgagee. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>TDL and the Mortgagee did not agree otherwise. They did
    not agree, explicitly or implicitly, to exclude TDL’s right of set-off. Quite
    the contrary. The parties agreed that when the Mortgagee enforced its security,
    the Mortgagee would take over the Landlord’s position under the Lease.  That position included the state of accounts
    then existing between the Landlord and TDL. The parties carved out one exception:
    prepayment of rent. Otherwise, the Mortgagee was bound by the existing state of
    accounts, including TDL’s right of set-off. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>iii. Commercial practice</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My interpretation of the PNDA also reflects current commercial
    practice. As the motion judge acknowledged, a term excluding set-off rights is
    common in postponement and non-disturbance agreements favourable to mortgagees.
    The annotation by Lem and Singerman points out that, typically, a mortgagee
    will seek to protect itself by requesting an estoppel certificate from the
    tenant, establishing the state of accounts between the Landlord and tenant at a
    particular time, and by negotiating an appropriately worded postponement and
    non-disturbance agreement, exempting it from responsibility for the tenant’s
    state of accounts with the Landlord. Indeed, the annotators comment that “a
    canvassing of the non-disturbance agreements currently in use across a broad
    base of the commercial lending spectrum will disclose an almost universal
    inclusion of at least some sort of provision expressly excluding set-off as an
    equity that must be honoured by the assignee”. See also J. Lem, “Subordination
    and Attornment” in H. M. Haber, ed.,<i> Tenants Rights and Remedies in a
    Commercial Lease</i> (Aurora, ON: Canada Law Book, 1998) 357; and H. M. Haber, <i>The
    Commercial Lease,</i> 4<sup>th</sup> ed. (Aurora, ON: Canada Law Book, 2004),
    Article 15.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the Mortgagee neither requested an estoppel certificate
    from TDL nor excluded set-off rights in the PNDA. Indeed, the Mortgagee agreed
    to a postponement and non-disturbance agreement that was weighted heavily in
    favour of the tenant. Commercial practice does not automatically translate into
    legal rights and obligations, but it does give some practical comfort to my
    interpretation of the PNDA. I turn now to the Mortgagee’s remaining arguments.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>c. Interpreting the PNDA to
    produce a sensible commercial result</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have said, the basic goal of contract interpretation is
    to determine the parties’ intent from the words that they used. In <i>Consolidated-Bathurst
    Export Ltd. v. Mutual Boiler and Machinery Insurance Co</i>., [1980] 1 S.C.R.
    888 at 901, Estey J. elaborated on this basic goal. In doing so, he made the
    important point that courts should strive to interpret a contract in a way that
    produces a sensible commercial result:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> Consequently, literal meaning should not be
    applied where to do so would bring about an unrealistic result or a result
    which would not be contemplated in the commercial atmosphere in which the
    insurance was contracted. Where words may bear two constructions, the more
    reasonable one, that which produces a fair result, must certainly be taken as
    the interpretation which would promote the intention of the parties. Similarly,
    an interpretation which defeats the intentions of the parties and their
    objective in entering into the commercial transaction in the first place should
    be discarded in favour of an interpretation … which promotes a sensible
    commercial result. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Mortgagee relied on Estey J.’s discussion of contract
    interpretation. It argued that interpreting the PNDA to give effect to TDL’s position
    would not yield either a fair or a sensible commercial result. I do not accept
    this argument. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the Mortgagee and TDL signed the PNDA, there was no hint
    of any dispute between TDL and the Landlord. The PNDA was signed in November
    1999; the Landlord improperly posted the termination notice, which led to the
    breach of the Lease six months later, in April 2000. TDL likely insisted on
    using its own form of postponement and non-disturbance agreement. And the
    Mortgagee, either because it acceded to TDL’s stronger bargaining position or
    because it didn’t care at the time, signed TDL’s form of agreement. In this
    context, I am not persuaded that the large set-off award, undoubtedly
    unanticipated by TDL as much as by the Mortgagee, turns my interpretation of
    the PNDA into one that is not commercially fair or sensible. I accept that my
    interpretation threatens to deprive the Mortgagee of much, if not all, of the
    benefit of the Lease. But I do not think that the court’s role is to relieve a
    relatively sophisticated party from the consequences of what turned out to be a
    bad bargain.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the principle from <i>Consolidated-Bathurst, supra</i> on which the Mortgagee relies, depends on the existence of two plausible
    interpretations of the PNDA. I am not persuaded that the Mortgagee’s
    interpretation is plausible. Tenants and mortgagees routinely enter into
    postponement and non-disturbance agreements. In doing so, they have to allocate
    the risk of a defaulting landlord/mortgagor. In this case, the Mortgagee must
    have been aware of that risk because in taking an assignment of rents from the
    Landlord, it insisted on a covenant from the Landlord to perform its
    obligations under the Lease.  In the
    PNDA, however, the Mortgagee agreed to exclude only the risk of prepayment of
    rent. Effectively, it agreed to assume all other risks. In this sense, the
    result in this case is not commercially unfair, but rather, it is consistent
    with the risk the Mortgagee agreed to bear.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>d. Ambiguity and <i>contra

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    interpreting a contract, courts have used a variety of techniques to avoid
    injustice. One technique is to use the principle of <i>contra proferentum</i>.
    Where the meaning of a contract provision is ambiguous or uncertain, a court
    will construe the provision against the party who drafted it. See <i>Consolidated-Bathurst,
    supra</i> at 900; and <i>Eli Lilly, supra</i> at para. 53.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Mortgagee urged us to apply <i>contra proferentum </i>to the interpretation of
    the PNDA. It submitted that whether the PNDA permits TDL to exercise its right
    of set-off against the Mortgagee is uncertain, and, as TDL drew the document,
    it should be interpreted contrary to TDL’s interests. I do not accept this
    submission.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although
    TDL used its standard form postponement and non-disturbance agreement, and the
    Mortgagee signed this standard form, I doubt that <i>contra proferentum </i>could
    play any role in interpreting the PNDA. This was a straightforward commercial
    transaction; both sides were represented by experienced, commercial lawyers;
    and though TDL likely had more bargaining power, we have no evidence that the
    Mortgagee was powerless to negotiate changes to the PNDA.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However,
    the main reason why <i>contra proferentum</i> can play no role in interpreting
    the PNDA is that the meaning of the agreement is not ambiguous or uncertain.
    For the reasons that I have already given, I do not think that TDL’s right to
    assert its court-ordered set-off against rent payable to the Mortgagee is in
    doubt. I would therefore not give effect to the Mortgagee’s argument on <i>contra
    proferentum</i>. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Second Issue: Is TDL’s judgment
    against the Landlord binding on the Mortgagee?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    motion judge held that even if he was wrong in his conclusion that the PNDA
    created a “clean slate” between TDL and the Mortgagee, nonetheless the
    Mortgagee was not bound by the judgment of Blenus Wright J. He gave these
    reasons for his holding: the Mortgagee was not a party to the litigation before
    Blenus Wright J; the Mortgagee was not given timely notice of that litigation;
    and the terms of the Lease did not give TDL a right of set off for the
    Landlord’ s breach of its covenant to indemnify TDL under s. 6.06 of the Lease.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    holding that the Mortgagee was not bound by Blenus Wright J.’s judgment, the
    motion judge, understandably, was concerned about the size of the judgment,
    especially the costs component, and therefore about the amount TDL sought to
    set off against its rent. The motion judge also expressed concern about Blenus
    Wright J.’s analysis, especially about how he reached the conclusion that set
    off should be permitted.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although
    I am sympathetic to the motion judge’s reluctance to fix the Mortgagee with the
    responsibility for paying the judgment against the Landlord, I do not agree
    with his analysis. I do not think that the Mortgagee had to be a party to or
    have notice of the litigation before Blenus Wright J. to be fixed with
    responsibility for the outcome of that litigation. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    litigation by itself did not affect the Mortgagee and would not have affected
    the Mortgagee but for its separate agreement with TDL. In other words, the
    Mortgagee’s responsibility for the judgment of Blenus Wright J. depended solely
    on the terms of the PNDA. It either agreed or did not agree to assume
    responsibility for the existing state of accounts between TDL and the Landlord
    if it went into possession. If, as I have concluded, the PNDA bound the
    Mortgagee to accept the state of accounts between the Landlord and TDL (other
    than any prepayment of rent), the Mortgagee must assume responsibility for the
    set off; if the PNDA did not so bind the Mortgagee, it would have had no
    responsibility for the set off. The situation might be different if TDL’s
    judgment was obtained by fraud but that obviously is not the case here.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>TDL’s
    action against the Landlord arose from a landlord-tenant dispute between them.
    I do not see why, as a matter of law or policy, a mortgagee should be
    encouraged to intervene in a landlord-tenant dispute. Nor do I think that the
    law should encourage what amounts to a  reconsideration of the judgment in that dispute. I will say, however, that
    TDL was unquestionably entitled in equity to set off its damages award against
    rent, as Blenus Wright J. found. See <i>Manufacturers Life Insurance Co. v.
    First brook, Cassie &amp; Anderson Ltd.</i> (1999), 5 R.P.R 4<sup>th</sup> 241
    (Ont. Sup. Ct.). The amount of the substantial indemnity costs award, though
    large, was arrived at after an assessment that has not been impeached. And the
    judgment of Blenus Wright J. was affirmed in all respects by this court.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>TDL
    also argued that the Mortgagee was bound by the litigation before Blenus Wright
    J. as a party in privity of interest who had adequate notice of that
    litigation. In short, TDL submitted that  issue estoppel applies. See <i>Banque Nationale de Paris (Canada) v.</i> <i>Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</i> (2001), 52 O.R. (3d) 161 (C.A.).  This submission has merit.  As landlord, the Mortgagee had privity of
    interest with the Landlord. TDL made the Mortgagee aware of its litigation
    against the Landlord in a letter sent nearly two years before the action was
    tried. Although the letter did not detail the nature of the litigation, it
    might have triggered an inquiry from a prudent potential landlord. The
    Mortgagee, however, made no inquiries. Even after it became fully aware of the
    trial judgment of Blenus Wright J., the Mortgagee took no steps to intervene in
    the Landlord’s appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However,
    I do not think that I need to decide whether issue estoppel is an alternative
    basis to hold the Mortgagee bound by TDL’s right of set-off.  My main point is that the PNDA alone
    determines the Mortgagee’s obligations. And under the PNDA, the Mortgagee must
    assume the burden of TDL’s court-ordered right of set-off. I would not give
    effect to this ground of appeal. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Which of Two Innocent Parties
    Must Suffer?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>My
    proposed disposition of this appeal undoubtedly seems harsh. The Mortgagee
    bears no responsibility for the wrongs done by the Landlord to TDL. It could
    not have anticipated that those wrongs would result in a judgment of over
    $700,000. Giving effect to TDL’s right to set-off this judgment against rent
    may mean that the Mortgagee is deprived of rent for the entire balance of the
    Lease. Moreover, in this case, rather atypically, the tenant, not the
    Mortgagee, has the financial clout and leverage. The Mortgagee is not an
    institutional lender.  TDL is the
    franchisor of Canada’s largest coffee chain. It is thus not hard to sympathize
    with the predicament of this entirely innocent Mortgagee.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>But
    TDL is also an innocent party. It too could not have anticipated that the
    Landlord would act so irresponsibly. And, as Blenus Wright J. concluded,
    requiring TDL to pay rent before setting off its judgment would be
    unconscionable. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Thus,
    whatever the court’s disposition, one of two innocent parties will suffer. The
    PNDA says that the Mortgagee must suffer. The law of assignment says that
    absent an agreement to the contrary, the assignee must suffer. At least in this
    case the contract and the law correspond with the reality that the Mortgagee
    could have protected itself. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Mortgagee must be taken to have known that the Landlord’s actions could
    potentially impair its ability to collect rent. The Mortgagee could have asked
    TDL for an estoppel certificate, which would have set out the state of accounts
    between TDL and the Landlord. It could have protected itself by a properly
    worded postponement and non-disturbance agreement. It could have asked TDL
    about the nature of the dispute with the Landlord. The Mortgagee did none of
    these things. Unfortunately for it, the Mortgagee must live with the
    consequences of its failure to do so. </span></p>
