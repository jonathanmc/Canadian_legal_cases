      August</span>&nbsp;21,&nbsp;2002, Robert Chiovitti went to the home of
      James Trakas ostensibly to test drive a motorcycle that Trakas was selling.  Chiovitti
      was driving a late model pick-up truck that bore a stolen licence plate.  Chiovitti
      falsely identified himself to Trakas.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Trakas
    allowed Chiovitti to take the motorcycle for a test drive on the condition
    that Chiovitti leave his pick-up truck for security.  Shortly after Chiovitti
    left on the motorcycle, Trakas noticed the pick-up truck was being driven
    away by an unknown person.  Trakas got into his Dodge Durango and began chasing
    the pick-up truck.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>During
      the car chase, Trakas telephoned the South Simcoe Police and told them
      that he was chasing a Chevrolet pick-up truck that was involved in the
      theft of his motorcycle.  P.C. Kuzmich of the South Simcoe Police force
      was dispatched to investigate.  He decided to place a “stop-stick” at the
      10<sup>th</sup> concession and
    <st1:Street w:st="on">

    chased the pick-up truck over approximately 46&nbsp;kilometres of major highways
    and secondary roads.  The two vehicles reached speeds in excess of 140 kph.  The
    chase ended approximately thirty minutes after it began when Trakas struck
    and killed P.C. Kuzmich while he was in the process of laying down the “stop-stick”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

    the early morning of August 22, 2002, the motorcycle was found in a ditch.  Chiovitti
    was lying nearby, unconscious and seriously injured.  He died from his injuries
    shortly after being taken to hospital.  The stolen motorcycle was not involved
    in the chase and is not directly involved with the matters before the court.  </p>

      (in respect of the license plate).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
      the preliminary inquiry, in order to establish that the respondent was
      the pick-up truck driver, the Crown relied on records of cellphones associated
      with the respondent and Chiovitti which demonstrated communication between
      them on the day of the incident.  The Crown also presented the evidence
      of an eyewitness, Ashley Goodyer, who briefly saw the driver of the pick-up
      truck as it sped by and who believed the respondent may have been the driver.  The
      Crown took the position that it relied on Ashley Goodyer’s evidence only
      for its circumstantial value in establishing that the respondent looked
      similar to the driver of the pick-up truck.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    issues at the preliminary inquiry were two-fold:  the identity of the driver
    of the pick-up truck; and, the role, if any, that he played in causing the
    death of P.C.&nbsp;Kuzmich.  For the purposes of the preliminary inquiry,
    the defence conceded that the driving of both Trakas and the driver of the
    pick-up truck was criminally negligent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    an eight-day preliminary inquiry, Douglas&nbsp;J. <span lang=EN-US>found
    that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to identify the respondent
    as the driver of the pick-up truck but that there was no evidence that he “caused” the
    police officer’s death.  He committed the respondent to trial on the offences
    of dangerous driving and possession of a stolen license plate.  H</span>e
    discharged the respondent on the offences of criminal negligence causing
    death and theft under.  It appears that, through oversight, the preliminary
    inquiry judge neither committed nor discharged the respondent on the count
    of theft over $5,000 (the motorcycle).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown and the respondent both brought applications to quash the order of
    the preliminary inquiry judge.  The Crown sought, by means of its application,
    to have the respondent ordered to stand trial on criminal negligence causing
    death and theft over $5,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent sought, by means of his application, <span
lang=EN-US>to quash the committal on charges of dangerous driving and possession
    of stolen license plates.  His </span>application was based on the argument
    that the evidence on identification was too flimsy to support a reasonable
    inference that the respondent was the driver of the pick&#8209;up truck.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    February 22, 2005, Clark&nbsp;J. dismissed both applications.  He upheld
    the preliminary inquiry judge’s committal based on the sufficiency of circumstantial
    evidence of identity.  He went further and concluded that the evidence of
    Ashley Goodyer was sufficient direct evidence of identity to warrant committal
    on the theft, possession and dangerous driving counts.  He also upheld the
    preliminary inquiry judge’s discharge of the respondent on the count of criminal
    negligence causing death.  With the agreement of the parties, he remedied
    the oversight in respect of the count of theft over $5,000 (the motorcycle)
    and committed the respondent to stand trial on that charge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown appeals from the dismissal of its application.  This appeal centres
    on the issue of causation.  The primary issue raised is whether there was
    some evidence before the preliminary inquiry judge that the respondent “caused” the
    police officer’s death.  The Crown argues that the reviewing judge erred
    in failing to find that the preliminary inquiry judge fell into jurisdictional
    error and asks for an order requiring the preliminary inquiry judge to commit
    the respondent to stand trial on the count of criminal negligence causing
    death.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent appeals the order of the reviewing judge dismissing his application
    (“the cross-appeal”).  <span lang=EN-US>The issue raised on the cross-appeal
    is the sufficiency of the evidence of the identification of the respondent
    as the driver of the pick-up truck.  </span>The respondent asks that the
    order below be quashed and that he be discharged on all charges.  <span lang=EN-US>      </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    ease of reference, the Crown is referred to as the appellant and Mr. Shilon

    reversal in the two appeals.  </p>

lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For

      the section creating the offence and principles of interpretation.  These

lang=EN-US>Textbook of Criminal Law</span></i><span
lang=EN-US>, 2d ed. (London: Stevens &amp; Sons Limited, 1983) at 391:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Putting the rule in terms of causation,
      the new intervening act (<i>novus actus interveniens</i>) of a responsible
      actor, who has full knowledge of what he is doing, and is not subject to
      mistake or pressure, will normally operate to relieve the defendant of
      liability for a further consequence, because it makes the consequence “too
      remote.”  Underlying this rule there is, undoubtedly, a philosophical attitude.  Moralists
      and lawyers regard the individual’s will as the autonomous prime cause
      of his behaviour.  <i>What a person does (if he has reached adult years,
      is of sound mind and is not acting under mistake, intimidation or other
      similar pressure) is his own responsibility, and is not regarded as having
      been caused by other people.  An intervening act of this kind, therefore,
      breaks the causal connection that would otherwise have been perceived between
      previous acts and the forbidden consequence</i>.  (An intervening wrongful
      omission does not break it.)</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The rule can be rationalised in
      psychological terms by saying that the intervention of the responsible
      actor diverts our retributive wrath from the defendant, the previous actor,
      who may appear to be so much less culpable than the later actor, and this
      switching of retributive feeling is expressed in causal language.  Sometimes,
      too, we may feel that making people responsible for the subsequent behaviour
      of others, merely because they foresaw or could have foreseen that behaviour,
      would be too great a restriction upon liberty.  Yet another way of explaining
      the rule would be to say that part of the object of the criminal trial
      is to dramatise society’s rejection of the deed, and this is adequately
      done by prosecuting the immediate author.  There is no pressing necessity
      to regard more remote authors as responsible for the harm itself, though
      they may well be prosecuted for other offences, such as attempt, or in
      appropriate circumstances as accessories.  It is important that the law
      should not saddle a man with liability for consequences that not only he
      but also the general public would blame on someone else.  [Emphasis added]</span></p>

      accept that independent voluntary human intervention in events started
      by an accused may break the chain of causation.  However, on any realistic
      appraisal of the facts, and as was found by both levels of court below,
      Trakas’ conduct was directly linked to that of the driver of the pick-up
      truck.  Glanville Williams writes of intervening cause where the responsible
      actor is not acting under “mistake, intimidation or other similar pressure”.  Was
      Trakas acting free of “similar pressure”?  It was the conduct of the driver
      of the pick-up truck that provoked Trakas’ driving.  It was the driver
      of the pick-up truck who created and continued the highly charged situation
      in which Trakas, the victim of a premeditated theft, responded predictably
      to catch the thief and recover his property.  In my view, the question
      of whether Trakas’
    actions are sufficiently independent as to sever the chain of causation is
    a question best left to a properly instructed jury.  </span></p>

    in that each engaged in the same activity even though they acted with opposing
    intents.  Although Trakas wanted to catch the respondent and the respondent
    wanted to get away, the Crown submits that their chasing behaviour is more
    properly analysed as acting in concert because the continuation of the dangerous
    behaviour depended on the participation of both actors.  There was no reason
    for the respondent to flee if he were not being chased by Trakas; there was
    no reason for Trakas to pursue if the respondent did not flee.  Thus, the
    Crown maintains, there was evidence of mutuality of conduct on which a jury

    are jointly, intentionally involved (i.e., racing) and one which creates

    the risk of danger to themselves and others or, in the circumstances of the
    degree of departure from reasonably prudent and lawful driving standards,
    can be taken as having an unrestrained disregard for the consequences of
    their actions.  It is the mutuality of their contribution toward the rivalry
    of speed which creates a singular hazardous situation.  [emphasis added.]</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Two persons may be guilty as joint perpetrators.  Hence
    where a body of men beat a constable (some with sticks, some by throwing
    stones, some with their fists), and the constable died of the aggregate violence,
    the judge directed the jury that “If several persons act together <i>in pursuance
    of a common intent</i>, every act done in furtherance of such intent by each
    of them is, in law, done by all.” [Footnotes omitted, emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I am of the view that mutuality of intention between parties to pursue a
    common unlawful venture is essential to a finding that the parties are co-perpetrators
    within the scope of s.&nbsp;21(1)(a), unlike road&#8209;racing behaviour,
    a driver being chased by another cannot be regarded as a co-perpetrator to
    an offence committed by the chasing driver.  The driver being chased is not
    intentionally encouraging or inciting the other.  On the contrary, the driver
    being chased is, by his actions, likely intending to <i>discourage</i> the
    other from following.  The two drivers are independent actors, each creating
    a danger that is separate and distinct from that created by the other.  In
    my view, absent a common intention, one driver is not responsible for the
    conduct of the other within the meaning of s. 21(1)(a).    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown argues on the basis that liability for the offence flows from Trakas
    to the driver of the pick-up truck.  For the reasons given, I reject the
    notion that the driver of the pick-up truck is liable as a co-perpetrator.  That,
    however, does not end the analysis under s. 21(1)(a).  As explained in the
    preceding section, the conduct of the driver of the pick-up truck may be
    seen to encompass the driving by Trakas on the basis that Trakas’ actions
    were a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the conduct of the driver of
    the pick-up truck.  The driver of the pick-up truck knew he was being pursued
    by Trakas but he continued his high-speed flight, driving in a fashion that
    showed a wanton and reckless disregard for the lives or safety of others,
    knowing that it was likely that Trakas would follow suit.    On that basis,
    the liability of the driver of the pick-up truck is as the perpetrator, that
    is, as the person who actually committed the offence of criminal negligence
    causing death.     </p>

      the Crown argues that under s.&nbsp;21(1)(c), the respondent abetted Trakas

      that there must be some evidence that the driver of the pick-up truck “intentionally

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown argues that the preliminary inquiry judge erred by equating the notion
    of “purpose” with “desire”.  The Crown says that the fact that the respondent
    did not wish Trakas to pursue him is irrelevant – what matters is whether
    the respondent intended the consequence (Trakas’ driving) that flowed from
    his conduct.  The Crown maintains that this requirement is fulfilled by evidence
    that the respondent subjectively knew that his conduct, as a means of achieving
    his purpose of escaping, was substantially certain to encourage Trakas, whether
    or not the respondent viewed this as desirable.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the respondent’s culpability cannot be grounded in s.&nbsp;21(1)(c),
    as an abettor.  Although abetting can include encouraging a principal to
    commit the offence, the trier of fact must be satisfied that the accused’s
    acts or words encouraged another to commit a crime and that the accused intended
    his or her actions or words to have that effect.  See <i>R. v. Greyeyes</i> (1997),
    116 C.C.C. (3d) 334 at para.38 (S.C.C.), Cory J.  The evidence in this case
    is not capable of supporting a reasonable inference that the driver of the
    pick-up <i>intended</i> to encourage Trakas to drive as he did.  The driver
    of the pick-up truck intended the opposite – to escape or to have Trakas
    stop pursuing him.   </p>

      Chiovitti phoning the respondent or vice versa.  During the time that the
      driver of the pick-up truck was being chased by Trakas, Chiovitti made
      three calls to the respondent’s cellphone.  From these findings, the preliminary
      inquiry judge concluded that there was some contact among the respondent,

      arising from the telephone records to support a finding that the respondent
      was Chiovitti’s accomplice in the theft and the driver of the pick-up truck.  He
      contends that the phone records do no more than establish that the respondent
      and Chiovitti had telephone contact, or attempted telephone contact, on
      the afternoon and evening of the theft.  He says that the respondent’s
      failure to telephone Chiovitti for 45 to 55 minutes after the chase ended
      indicate that he was not the driver of the pick-up truck.  He points also
      to evidence that Chiovitti had been involved in other thefts committed
      in a similar way with a third party accomplice (Phil Larizza) and that
      Chiovitti and Larizza spoke on the telephone numerous times on the day
      of the theft.  On the other hand, there was no evidence that the respondent
      had previously been involved with Chiovitti or Larizza in similar thefts
      and there was no physical or forensic evidence linking the respondent to
      the pick-up truck.  Thus, he argues, the inference that the respondent
      was driving the pick-up truck was not reasonably available and, by finding
      to the contrary, the preliminary inquiry judge exceeded his jurisdiction
      in committing the respondent to stand trial on any offences.  </span></p>

      for <i>certiorari </i>to review committal to stand trial.  As he expressly

      for committal.  Referring to <i>Re Skogman and the Queen </i>(1984), 13
      C.C.C. (3d) 161 at 173 (S.C.C.), he emphasized the need for deference to

      the reviewing judge concluded:</span></p>

    implicating the accused as the driver of the pickup truck was minimal, it
    cannot be said that there was no proper material upon which the preliminary
