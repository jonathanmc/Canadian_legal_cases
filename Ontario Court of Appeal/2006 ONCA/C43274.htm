      the Divisional Court (Justice John G. O’Driscoll, Justice Jean L. MacFarland
      and Justice Katherine E. Swinton) dated November 1, 2004 made at Toronto,
      Ontario.</span></h4>

      main issue on this appeal is the appropriate standard of review of a labour
      arbitration board’s decision that the collective agreement did not give
      it authority to award aggravated or punitive damages in connection with
      a grievance for unjust dismissal. Put differently, is an arbitration board’s
      application of the exclusive jurisdiction principle in <i>Weber v. Ontario
      Hydro</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 929 entitled to deference from a reviewing court?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      appellant employer, Seneca College, says that the appropriate standard
      of review is patent unreasonableness. The respondent union, Ontario Public
      Service Employees Union (OPSEU), says that the standard is correctness.
      The Divisional Court agreed with OPSEU on the standard of review, and concluded
      that the Board of Arbitration erred in limiting the scope of its remedial
      authority. The Divisional Court therefore remitted the matter to the Board
      to determine whether aggravated and punitive damages should be awarded
      and, if so, in what amount. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>B. BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>1. The Grievance</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      incidents giving rise to the grievance and this litigation took place in
      the 1990s. Seneca College and OPSEU, Local 560 were parties to a collective
      agreement covering the academic staff of the College. Relations between
      the parties had been strained for several years. Two of the principal protagonists
      were Melvin Fogel, the College’s Director of Employee Relations, and the
      eventual grievor, Larry Olivo, a lawyer, a teacher on staff since 1980
      and, at the time of his dismissal, vice president of Local 560.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      poor relations between the parties further deteriorated in 1997 when Fogel
      sued Olivo and other members of Local 560 for libel arising from statements
      in the Union’s newsletter attributed to Fogel. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      February 1998, Seneca College fired Olivo. The College contended that in
      1990 and 1991, Olivo had sent anti-Semitic material to Fogel in reusable,
      inter-departmental envelopes. The material in question was blatantly anti-Semitic.
      Olivo, however, denied any involvement in either creating or sending the
      material to Fogel. OPSEU grieved his dismissal under the grievance and
      arbitration provisions of the collective agreement.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>2. The Collective Agreement</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Dismissal</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>32.06</b> It being understood that the dismissal
    of an employee during the probationary period shall not be the subject of
    a grievance, an employee who has completed the probationary period may lodge
    a grievance in the manner set out in 32.07 and 32.08.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>32.07</b> An employee who claims to have been
    dismissed without just cause shall, within 20 days of the date of receipt
    of the written notification of the dismissal, present a grievance in writing
    to the College President, or in the absence of the College President, the
    Acting President, commencing at Step Two and the President shall convene
    a meeting and give the grievor and the Union Steward the President’s decision
    in accordance with the provisions of Step Two of 32.03.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>32.08</b> If the grievor is not satisfied with
    the decision of the College President, the grievor shall, within 15 days
    of receipt of the decision of the College President, or in the absence of
    the President, the Acting President, by notice in writing to the College,
    refer the matter to arbitration, as provided in this Agreement.</p>

      32.03, 32.04 A and 32.04 C of the collective agreement provided for “final
      and binding” arbitration of all differences arising from the interpretation,
      application, administration or alleged contravention of the agreement,
      including any question about whether a matter was arbitrable:</span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the event that any difference arising from the
    interpretation, application, administration or alleged contravention of this
    Agreement has not been satisfactorily settled under the foregoing Grievance
    Procedures, the matter shall then, by notice in writing given to the other
    party within 15 days of the date of receipt by the grievor of the decision
    of the College official at Step Two, be referred to arbitration.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>32.04 A</b> Any matter so referred to arbitration,

      collective agreement did not address the conduct relied on by OPSEU to
      assert claims for aggravated and punitive damages. Nor did it expressly
      authorize arbitrators to give these damages. However, the agreement did
      not expressly preclude them from doing so either.  Article 32.04 D of the
      agreement, the only express limit on the Board’s authority, precluded a
      board of arbitration from making any decision inconsistent with the agreement
      or from dealing with any matter “not a proper matter for grievance”. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>3. The Board of Arbitration’s

      grievance was heard by a three-person Board of Arbitration chaired by Ms.
      Pamela Picher, an experienced labour arbitrator.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>a. First Award: Reinstatement</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Board found that the evidence linking Olivo to the anti-Semitic material
      was weak at best. More importantly, the College’s delay of seven to eight
      years in taking action against Olivo was, in the words of the unanimous
      Board, “unwarranted, prejudicial and of sufficient gravity to vitiate Mr.
      Olivo’s discharge in its entirety.” On that ground alone, the Board voided
      Olivo’s dismissal, and ordered that he be reinstated with full compensation,
      including seniority and benefits. Seneca College did not challenge this
      order.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>b. Supplementary Award: OPSEU’s
      Claim for Aggravated and Punitive Damages</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>After
      a further hearing, the Board issued a supplementary award, because in addition
      to basic compensatory relief, OPSEU sought aggravated and punitive damages.
      It argued that the College intentionally inflicted mental distress on Olivo,
      and defamed him by labeling him as anti-Semitic. In seeking these tort-like
      damages, OPSEU relied on the Supreme Court of Canada’s decisions in <i>Weber
      v. Ontario Hydro, supra,</i> <i>Vorvis v. Insurance Company of British
      Columbia</i> (1989), 58 D.L.R. (4th) 193 (S.C.C.), and <i>Wallace v. United
      Grain Growers Ltd</i>. (1997), 152 D.L.R. (4th) 1 (S.C.C.). </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>According
      to OPSEU, in the light of <i>Weber</i>, the Board of Arbitration had the
      authority to adjudicate Olivo’s claims of intentional infliction of mental
      suffering and defamation in connection with his dismissal because that
      authority arose inferentially from the collective agreement. Therefore,
      if the Board of Arbitration was seized with the authority to adjudicate
      these tort-like claims, OPSEU contended that the Board had the authority
      to remedy the tortious conduct by an award of aggravated and punitive damages. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In <i>Vorvis</i>,
      the Supreme Court held that in rare instances, a court could award aggravated
      damages for mental distress and punitive damages in a wrongful dismissal
      case, if the acts complained of amounted to an independent, actionable
      wrong. OPSEU argued that the misconduct of the College was independently
      actionable because it constituted a breach of another article of the collective
      agreement – article 3.02 – the non-discrimination clause. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In <i>Wallace</i>,
      the Supreme Court held that a court may award damages flowing from the
      manner of dismissal, in addition to damages resulting from the dismissal
      itself. In other words, an employer’s bad faith conduct or unfair dealing
      during the course of a dismissal may be compensable. OPSEU argued that
      an employer’s duty of good faith and fair dealing in the manner of dismissal
      under an individual contract of employment should apply to employers in
      collective bargaining relationships.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      a lengthy and thorough decision, the Board of Arbitration concluded that
      the collective agreement did not give it jurisdiction to award aggravated
      or punitive damages. OPSEU was not powerless to seek these damages, but
      it could do so only in the courts. The Board reached this conclusion by
      applying the exclusive jurisdiction principle for resolving workplace disputes
      established by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Weber</i>. The Board held
      that the essential character of the dispute was the College’s alleged tortious
      misconduct of defaming or intentionally inflicting mental distress on Mr.
      Olivo. In the Board’s view, that dispute did not arise either expressly
      or inferentially under the collective agreement. Thus, the Board had no
      power to grant the damages sought by OPSEU for the College’s tortious conduct.
      The power to award these damages based on <i>Vorvis</i> and <i>Wallace</i> resided
      in the residual jurisdiction of the courts. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Board distinguished the collective agreement in <i>Weber</i> from the collective
      agreement in this case. The agreement in <i>Weber</i> contained a clause
      extending the grievance and arbitration process   to “any allegation that
      an employee has been subjected to unfair treatment.” The Supreme Court
      of Canada relied on this clause to conclude that the alleged tortious conduct
      of the employer arose inferentially under the collective agreement and,
      therefore, was arbitrable. The agreement before the Board contained no
      similar clause, nor in the Board’s view, any other clause “that might give
      rise to an inference that the parties intended a Board of Arbitration to
      adjudicate alleged tortious wrongdoing.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Board considered OPSEU’s argument that clause 3.02 of the collective agreement – which
      prohibited the College from intimidating or discriminating against an employee
      because of the employee’s union activity – gave it authority to award the
      damages claimed. In rejecting this argument, the Board stated, “it is insufficient
      that the alleged wrongdoing simply be able to support a separate, related
      grievance complaint, in addition to the complaint of unjust cause for discharge.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Board also addressed the intention of the parties. It found no evidence
      that the College and OPSEU intended their collective agreement, or article
      3.02 for that matter, to cover these tort damages. It noted that the parties
      could have included in their collective agreement clauses prohibiting tortious
      misconduct, but – as is typical of most parties to a collective agreement – had
      chosen not to do so. It gave several policy reasons why parties to a collective
      agreement have not clothed arbitrators with the authority to adjudicate
      allegations of tortious conduct:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoList4><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>they
    are not the normal subject matter of a collective agreement, which itself
    is the product of an ongoing relationship usually of lengthy duration;<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a></p>
  <p class=MsoList4><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>traditionally,
    courts have dealt with these allegations; labour arbitrators have focused
    on the workplace, not on personal issues;</p>
  <p class=MsoList4><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>allowing
    arbitrators to deal with these allegations would strain the financial resources
    available for arbitration proceedings; and</p>
  <p class=MsoList4><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>placing
    these wrongs within the grievance and arbitration process would put at risk “the
    very efficiency and vitality” of that process.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Thus,
      the Board of Arbitration concluded that it had no jurisdiction over OPSEU’s
      claim for additional damages:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Accordingly we conclude that the Board has no jurisdiction
    to entertain these allegations in tort respecting the intentional infliction
    of mental distress or defamation and, therefore, that this Board does not
    have, under <i>Weber</i> principles, the jurisdiction to award the aggravated
    or punitive damages that might follow upon a finding of such alleged tortious
    wrongdoing.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>4. The Divisional Court’s decision</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Divisional Court granted OPSEU’s application for judicial review of the
      Board of Arbitration’s decision that, under the collective agreement, it
      did not have jurisdiction to award aggravated or punitive damages to a
      grievor. The Court held that the standard of review was correctness because

      in a prompt, efficient and cost-effective way. Peace and harmony in the
      workplace depend on maintaining the integrity of the grievance and arbitration
      process. In turn, the integrity of this process will be maintained only
      if the courts give significant deference to the decisions of arbitrators.
      Moreover, under the statute, boards of arbitration resolve two-party disputes,
      not broad policy issues. See <i>Parry Sound (District) Social Services

      or jurisdiction-limiting issue on which the Board had to be correct. In

      branch: the question whether the Board could impose a particular remedy
      was “jurisdictional in nature” and, therefore, reviewable on a correctness
      standard. On this branch of the argument, both OPSEU and the Divisional
      Court relied on the following passage from the judgment of Cory J. in <i>Royal
      Oak Mines Inc. v. Canada (Labour</i> <i>Relations Board)</i>, [1996] 1
      S.C.R. 369 at para. 59:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Canada Labour Relations Board has been granted
    the power to impose remedies by s. 99(2) of the Code. Thus, the question
    as to whether the Board may or may not impose remedies on the parties is
    jurisdictional in nature. If the Board concluded that it could not impose
    a remedy to counteract a breach by one of the parties, the aggrieved party
    would have the right to argue before a reviewing court that the Board had
    incorrectly interpreted its enabling statute. The court, in addressing this
    jurisdictional question, would then be entitled to review the Board’s decision,
    on a correctness standard, to determine whether in fact the Board did have
    the power it claimed to lack. </p>

      I do not think that the passage from <i>Dayco</i>, <i>supra</i> relied
      on by the Divisional Court governs the nature of the question in this case.
      In <i>Dayco</i>, the union had launched a grievance over the company’s
      failure to pay retirement benefits. These benefits were promised in a collective
      agreement that had expired. The Supreme Court had to decide whether the
      arbitrator had jurisdiction to hear the grievance. However, LaForest J.
      distinguished between two kinds of “jurisdictional”
    questions: the broad question, whether a promise of retirement benefits could
    survive the expiry of an agreement; and the narrow question, whether the
    terms of the specific collective agreement between the parties provided for
    the vesting of retirement benefits. </span></p>

      passage from <i>Dayco</i> relied on by the Divisional Court concerned the
      broad jurisdictional question, whether a collective agreement on which
      to base the grievance even existed. As an agreement was the foundation
      of the arbitrator’s jurisdiction to hear the grievance, LaForest J. held
      that the question was a jurisdiction-conferring issue on which the arbitrator
      was not entitled to deference (at p. 620-621). </span></p>

      J. also discussed the narrower jurisdictional question: the interpretation
      of the specific terms of the collective agreement to determine whether
      a matter is arbitrable. On that question, he stated that the arbitrator
      would be entitled to deference:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is clear that an arbitrator has jurisdiction <i>stricto

      course of determining the arbitrability of matters under that agreement.
      In that case the arbitrator is acting within his or her “home territory”,
      and any judicial review of that interpretation must only be to a standard
      of patent unreasonableness (p. 620).  </p>

      my view, it is in the narrower sense of jurisdiction that the Board of
      Arbitration concluded it had no jurisdiction to award aggravated and punitive
      damages. In other words, the Board was determining a question of arbitrability.
      It was not deciding a jurisdiction-conferring or jurisdiction-limiting
      issue in the broad sense. In a broad sense, the collective agreement gave
      the Board jurisdiction to deal with Olivo’s grievance. That was not in
      dispute. What was in dispute was the narrower question, whether this collective
      agreement gave the Board the jurisdiction to award the specific damages

      it seems to me that the analysis in <i>Dayco</i> itself now has to be read
      in the light of the Supreme Court’s later decision in <i>Pushpanathan</i>,<i> supra</i> at
      para. 28. As Bastarache J. said in that case, “jurisdictional questions” describe
      those provisions attracting a correctness standard of review based on the
      outcome of the pragmatic and functional analysis. They don’t dictate the
      appropriate standard of review. As I am endeavouring to demonstrate, the
      outcome of the pragmatic and functional analysis in this case points to
      a highly deferential standard of review. In other words, the question here
      is not, in any broad sense, “jurisdictional.”</span></p>

      third reason I disagree with OPSEU’s position is that it seriously compromises
      the notion of arbitrability. Every question about whether a collective
      agreement gives an arbitrator authority to grant a particular remedy for
      an unjust dismissal can be labelled a “jurisdictional question.” If “jurisdiction” in
      this sense – and it was the sense in which the Board used the word – means
      that a Board of Arbitration’s answer to the question receives no curial
      deference, the principle that its decisions on matters of arbitrability
      are entitled to deference, will have little, if any, practical meaning.
      A “labeling approach” to determining the proper standard of review cannot
      be permitted to undermine or displace the pragmatic and functional approach. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      dividing line between the nature of questions pointing to significant deference
      and the nature of questions pointing to little or no deference is at times
      a hard line to draw. If, however, doubt arises about the proper characterization
      of a question or whether the question points to more or to less deference,
      the wise and often-repeated caution of Dickson J. in <i>Canadian Union</i> <i>of
      Public Employees, Local 963 v. New Brunswick Liquor Corp.</i>, [1979] 2
      S.C.R. 227 at 233 becomes apt:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The question of what is and is not jurisdictional
    is often very difficult to determine. The courts, in my view, should not
    be alert to brand as jurisdictional, and therefore subject to broader curial
    review, that which may be doubtfully so.</p>
  <p>This principle, in different words, has been reaffirmed many times by the
    Supreme Court. See for example <i>Teamsters Union, Local 983 v. Massicotte</i>,
    [1982] 1 S.C.R. 710 at 722 and 724; <i>Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. Canada
    (Labour Relations Board),</i> [1995] 1 S.C.R. 157 at para. 34.</p>

      I do not consider the characterization difficult in this case, if necessary
      I would invoke Dickson J.’s caution. In my view, in deciding whether the
      collective agreement inferentially gave it the authority to award aggravated
      and punitive damages, the Board was deciding a question of arbitrability.
      Its resolution of that question was therefore entitled to deference. </span></p>

      final reason I depart from the Divisional Court’s holding is that I do
      not think <i>Royal Oak</i>, <i>supra</i> can be relied on to support OPSEU’s
      position. In the light of the Supreme Court’s insistence that the standard
      of review must be determined by the pragmatic and functional approach,
      the passage from <i>Royal Oak</i> now has to be viewed as an overly broad,
      if not incorrect, statement of the current law. </span></p>

      Evans J.A. observed in <i>Via Rail</i>, <i>supra</i> at para. 46, the comment
      in <i>Royal Oak</i> that the interpretation of a board’s remedial authority
      is reviewable on a correctness standard because the question is jurisdictional “has
      been washed away by the torrent of the standard of review jurisprudence” from
      the Supreme Court in the last decade. But two examples are L’Heureux-Dubé J.’s
      judgment for the Supreme Court in <i>C.U.P.E., Local 301 v. Montreal (City)</i>,
      [1997] 1 S.C.R. 793 at paras. 44-47, in which she held that on the pragmatic
      and functional analysis, a tribunal’s interpretation of its remedial powers
      was entitled to deference even though those powers “appear to limit a tribunal’s
      jurisdiction”; and Iacobucci J.’s reasons in <i>Lethbridge Community College</i>, <i>supra</i> at
      paras. 22-23 in which he took a similar approach to the standard of review
      of the tribunal’s interpretation of its remedial authority. </span></p>

      in <i>Lethbridge Community College</i>,  the Supreme Court said that questions
      of remedial authority may have both a jurisdictional aspect and an arbitrability
      aspect. In that case, a board of arbitration was required to interpret
      the scope of its remedial authority under a section of Alberta’s <i>Labour
      Relations Code.</i> Iacobucci J., at paras. 18-19, said the extent of the
      board’s authority was a question of law that was both jurisdictional and
      remedial. The former suggested less deference; the latter more deference.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      is superficially attractive to take a similar approach to the Board’s application
      of the common law principle in <i>Weber</i>, especially since that principle
      dictates the scope of the tribunal’s jurisdiction and the court’s jurisdiction.
      But the Board’s task here differed from that of the board in <i>Lethbridge
      Community College</i> in crucial ways. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      the scope of the board’s remedial authority depended on the interpretation
      of a statutory provision, a question of law with considerable precedential
      significance. Even so, because that interpretation required an understanding
      of labour law issues, some deference was still warranted.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      the case before us, even greater deference is warranted because the Board
      was not even called on to interpret a statutory provision. Instead, it
      had to decide whether a particular collective agreement gave it authority
      to grant specified remedies for unjust dismissal. As I have already said,
      it was in this narrow sense that the Board was deciding whether it had
      jurisdiction over OPSEU’s claim.</span></p>

      the application of <i>Weber</i> involves not a general question of law
      alone, but a question that is partly factual and partly turns on the particular
      provisions of the collective agreement. <i>Weber</i> and the cases that
      have come after it required the Board of Arbitration to resolve three issues:
      what was the essential character of the dispute in its essential character,
      did this dispute arise out of the interpretation, application administration
      or violation of the collective agreement and, could the arbitration process
      under the collective agreement give an effective remedy for the dispute?
      See <i>Gaignard v.</i> <i>Canada (Attorney General)</i> (2003), 67 O.R.

      first issue is largely factual; the second and third issues, though questions
      of law, turn on the Board of Arbitration’s interpretation of the scope
      of its remedial authority under the collective agreement – in other words,
      whether OPSEU’s claim for aggravated and punitive damages was arbitrable.
      In resolving these issues, the Board was on the familiar terrain of the
      provisions of the collective agreement. Thus, the Board’s resolution of
      these issues should be entitled to a large measure of deference.</span></p>

      consideration that might suggest less deference is that the Board’s decision
      has some modest precedential value. The decision does depend on the language
      of this collective agreement, and is not strictly binding on other arbitrators.
      Nonetheless, the question whether standard grievance provisions in a collective
      agreement give arbitrators authority to award tort-like damages in connection
      with a dismissal is of general significance to the labour arbitration community.
      On balance, however, this third contextual factor also points to deference

      The Board had to determine whether the parties intended their collective
      agreement to give the Board the power to award aggravated and punitive
      damages for tort-like conduct.  The collective agreement did not give the
      Board express authority to award these damages. The Board gave cogent reasons
      why no provisions of the collective agreement inferentially gave it this
      authority. And the Board offered several policy justifications for why
      the parties would not inferentially give it this authority, and would instead
      limit its authority to award damages to damages for lost pay and benefits.
      Moreover, the views of the arbitral community are not unanimous on whether
      arbitrators do have the power to award aggravated and punitive damages.
