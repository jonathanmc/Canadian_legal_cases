  <p class=MsoBodyText>On appeal from the conviction entered by Justice G. Gordon
    Sedgwick of the Superior Court of Justice dated October 20, 2004 and the
    sentence imposed on November 22, 2004.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DOHERTY J.A.:</span></h4>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was convicted of one count of sexual assault causing bodily harm
    (count one), one count of sexual assault (count three), and acquitted on
    two charges of uttering a death threat (counts two and four).  W.J. was the
    complainant on all four counts.  Counts one and two arose out of an incident
    in March 2001.  Counts three and four related to an incident in the summer
    of 2001.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>W.J.
    and the appellant lived in the same apartment building.  Prior to March 2001,
    they were friends and had had a sexual relationship.  W.J. testified that
    one day in March at about 2:00 a.m., the appellant banged on her door.  When
    she let him in, it was clear to her that he was very drunk.  He quickly became
    very aggressive, pushed her on the couch and raped her.  According to W.J.,
    the appellant also threatened her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>W.J.
    testified that she suffered bruising and vaginal bleeding as a result of
    the attack.  She went to the hospital in Kingston the next day and was treated
    and released on the same day.  A doctor’s report filed at trial confirmed
    that W.J. attended the hospital in Kingston and complained of vaginal bleeding.  She
    did not tell anyone at the hospital that she had been sexually assaulted.  The
    doctor’s physical observations neither supported nor contradicted W.J.’s
    allegations.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>W.J.
    testified that after the attack, she did her best to avoid the appellant
    around the apartment building, especially when he had been drinking.  She
    would not let him into her apartment if she thought he had been drinking.  W.J.
    did let the appellant into her apartment on various occasions when he was
    sober to use her washing machine or her telephone.  He behaved himself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>W.J.
    also testified that in the summer of 2001, the appellant and a friend arrived
    at her door.  She decided to let them in because she thought she would be
    safe as the appellant was not alone.  Shortly after the two men entered the
    apartment, the appellant, who had been drinking, attacked W.J., ripping her
    shorts and underwear.  His friend persuaded the appellant to stop the attack
    and the two men left the apartment.  W.J. testified that the appellant threatened
    her as he was leaving the apartment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>W.J.
    did not report either assault to the police until September 2003, over two
    years after the second assault.  The assaults came to the attention of the
    police after W.J.’s son was charged with causing damage to the appellant’s
    apartment.  He had crawled into the space above the ceiling of the appellant’s
    apartment and poked holes in the appellant’s ceiling with a screwdriver.  W.J.’s
    son told the police that he damaged the appellant’s apartment ceiling hoping
    that it would frighten the appellant and cause him to move out of the building.  W.J.’s
    son had found a letter written by his mother in which she indicated she had
    been raped by the appellant.  He believed this allegation and it also appeared
    to him that his mother was afraid of the appellant.  The son’s explanation
    for damaging the appellant’s ceiling led the police to interview W.J. in
    September 2003.  She confirmed that she had been sexually assaulted by the
    appellant in 2001. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified and denied that either assault occurred.  His friend,
    who was allegedly present at the second assault, also testified and denied
    that the appellant had assaulted W.J. in his presence.  He acknowledged that
    he had been in W.J.’s apartment with the appellant on one occasion, but testified
    that nothing untoward had happened.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was the position of the appellant at trial that W.J. had falsely accused
    him of sexual assault to provide her son with an excuse for damaging the
    appellant’s apartment.  The appellant also testified that W.J. had become
    upset when she went to the appellant’s apartment and found him with another
    woman.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence at trial lasted less than two days.  Essentially, the case came
    down to the very different versions of the two incidents given by W.J. and
    the appellant.  The trial judge said very little about the evidence in his
    instructions.  He provided the jury with proper instructions on reasonable
    doubt, the assessment of the credibility of witnesses, and the essential
    elements of the offence.  </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>The
        Jury’s Question</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jury had many questions during its deliberations which spanned two days.  About
    five hours into the deliberations, the jury sent several questions to the
    trial judge.  These included the following question:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[S]hould we,
    the jury, be focussing more on if the Crown proved its case beyond a reasonable
    doubt or the credibility of the complainant and the accused, both issues
    together, or does one issue take precedent?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge heard submissions from counsel.  Crown counsel suggested a specific
    answer to the question.  Counsel for the appellant agreed that Crown counsel’s
    proposed answer should be given to the jury.  He suggested no changes or
    additions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge adopted the suggestion of Crown counsel and instructed the jury:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>First of all,
    I would remind you that you must assess the credibility of all the witnesses
    that you heard; and second, after you have done that, that is like a first
    step, <u>you have to decide what you believe and accept as the facts, and
    then you have to consider as a kind of second or third step – third step
    really because the second step is making your findings of fact, you have
    to consider and decide whether the facts you have found would support the
    proposition that the Crown has or has not proven its case beyond a reasonable
    doubt;</u> and I hope you see that these are sort of – they are not independent
    issues; one is related to the other and maybe it’s not unfair to say they
    are like steps in a process.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appellate
    counsel resiles from the position taken by trial counsel and submits that
    the trial judge’s response is wrong in law and constitutes reversible error.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Arguments
    by appellate counsel that fly in the face of positions taken by counsel at
    trial quite properly attract judicial scepticism and resistance.  The significance
    of counsel’s position at trial to the merits of the argument on appeal will
    depend on the nature of the argument advanced on appeal.  Where it is alleged
    that an instruction to the jury was unclear, inadequate on a legal or evidentiary
    issue raised in the trial, or did not treat the position of the appellant
    at trial fairly or fully, counsel’s approval of the jury instruction and
    to a lesser extent his or her failure to object, will be a significant consideration
    on appeal:  <i>R. v. Carriere</i> (2001), 159 C.C.C. (3d) 51 at para. 59
    (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. Johnson</i> (2002), 166 C.C.C. (3d) 44 at para. 57
    (Ont. C.A.).  Similarly, where an appellant argues that the trial judge failed
    to give an instruction that was discretionary, counsel’s failure to request
    the instruction at trial will be a significant consideration on appeal: <i>R.
    v. Glasgow</i> (1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 57 at 60 (Ont. C.A.).  Counsel’s position
    at trial will become all the more significant on appeal if it appears that
    the position reflects a calculated tactical decision: see <i>R. v. Lomage</i> (1991),
    2 O.R. (3d) 621 (C.A.); <i>R. v. Chan</i> (1989), 52 C.C.C. (3d) 184 (Alta.
    C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused (1990), 54 C.C.C. (3d) vi;  <i>R.
    v. Bevan</i> (1993), 82 C.C.C. (3d) 310 at 327 (S.C.C.).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where,
    however, the argument is that the trial judge misstated the law in his or
    her instructions, counsel’s position at trial is of less significance on
    appeal.  If an error in law is demonstrated, counsel’s position at trial
    is potentially relevant to the application of the <i>curative proviso</i>:  see <i>R.
    v. Chambers</i> (1990), 59 C.C.C. (3d) 321 at 344 (S.C.C.).  However, counsel’s
    position cannot justify treating an instruction that is wrong in law as a
    correct statement of the law.  A misstatement of the law is no less an error
    in law because it was made with the full support and approval of trial counsel.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this appeal, counsel contends that the trial judge’s answer misstated the
    legal principles applicable to the application of the reasonable doubt standard
    to credibility assessments.  If appellate counsel is correct, it is of no
    consequence, except perhaps to the application of the <i>curative proviso</i>,
    that the misstatement was made with the blessing of trial counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    assessing the adequacy of the trial judge’s response, I begin with the observation
    that all jury questions requesting clarification of the trial judge’s instructions
    are important: <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i> (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 at 410-11 (S.C.C.).  This
    question was particularly important.  It went to the heart of the jury’s
    task.  The jury clearly appreciated that the application of the reasonable
    doubt standard and their assessment of the credibility of the witnesses were
    interrelated.  Their question asked for clarification of that relationship.  With
    respect, I think the trial judge’s response misstated that relationship.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge told the jury to proceed in three stages.  He told the jury to
    first decide what they believed, to next determine the facts based on the
    evidence they believed, and third, to determine whether the Crown had proved
    the guilt of the accused on the facts as they had found them.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the approach outlined by the trial judge in his answer to the question, the
    jury’s verdict turned on who they believed without regard to the requirement
    that the Crown prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt.  I say this because
    the jury was told to
    “decide what you believe and accept as the facts”.  They were then told to
    apply the reasonable doubt standard to the facts they had found based on
    the evidence they accepted.  On the trial judge’s approach, if the jury decided
    they believed W.J.’s claim that she was sexually assaulted, they would find
    as a fact that she was sexually assaulted.  Up to this point in their deliberations,
    they would not have considered the reasonable doubt standard.  They would
    then apply the standard of reasonable doubt, not to the entirety of the record,
    but to the fact they had found, that is that W.J. was sexually assaulted.  On
    this approach, the entire exercise comes down to a determination of who the
    jury believed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s instruction ignored the possibility that the jury might not
    be able to decide which version of the events to believe and, therefore,
    would be unable to make the findings of fact described by the trial judge.  Recognition
    of the possibility that a jury may not be able to come to a definitive conclusion
    with respect to the credibility of competing versions of the relevant events
    is integral to a proper application of the reasonable doubt standard.  This
    potential middle ground is especially important in cases like this one where
    the accused testifies and presents a version of events that is diametrically
    opposed to that given by the Crown witnesses.  The jury must understand that
    if it cannot decide whose story to believe, it must acquit: see <i>R. v.
    W.(D.)</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 409.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jury’s question required that the trial judge make it clear that the ultimate
    question was whether the Crown had proved the essential elements of each
    offence beyond a reasonable doubt.  The jury should have been told that in
    making that ultimate determination, they had to assess the credibility of
    the witnesses, but in doing so it was not merely a question of choosing between
    the competing versions of events.  The jury should have been told that the
    reasonable doubt standard required that the jury decide whether the appellant’s
    evidence, considered in the context of the entirety of the evidence, left
    the jury with a reasonable doubt in respect to any elements of the offence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    words used by Cory J. in <i>R. v. W.(D)</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 409 provide
    a succinct and clear response to the jury’s question:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In a case where
    credibility is important, the trial judge must instruct the jury that the
    rule of reasonable doubt applies to that issue.  The trial judge should instruct
    the jury that they <u>need not firmly believe or disbelieve any witness or
    set of witnesses.  Specifically, the trial judge is required to instruct
    the jury that they must acquit the accused in two situations.  First, if
    they believe the accused.  Second, if they do not believe the accused’s evidence
    but still have a reasonable doubt as to his guilt after considering the accused’s
    evidence in the context of the evidence as a whole.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    language used in <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i>, <i>supra</i>, and similar language
    used in other cases, see e.g. <i>R. v. Minuskin </i>(2003), 181 C.C.C. (3d)
    542 at para. 22 (Ont. C.A.), makes the two important points missed by the
    trial judge in his response to the jury.  First, the jury is not required
    to believe one version or the other of the relevant events in order to return
    a verdict.  Second, the reasonable doubt standard must be applied to the
    totality of the evidence not just to the evidence accepted by the jury as
    true.  To put it in terms that have meaning on the facts of this case, the
    jury had to understand that they did not have to believe the appellant to
    acquit him.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the trial judge correctly instructed the jury on the reasonable doubt standard
    and the principles in <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i>, <i>supra</i>, in his main charge,
    the <i>curative proviso</i> cannot be applied.  The misdirection went to
    the most fundamental of the principles governing a fair trial.  The misdirection
    came in response to a jury’s question posed after several hours of deliberation.  Although
    the deliberations continued for several more hours and the jury ultimately
    acquitted on two of the charges, I cannot say with any confidence that there
    is no realistic possibility that the verdict would have been different had
    the jury received a correct answer to their question.  The misdirection constitutes
    reversible error.  </p>

    was a short, straightforward trial.  W.J. said she was sexually assaulted
    and threatened twice.  The appellant denied that he had assaulted or threatened
    her on either occasion and advanced an explanation or motive for her false
    accusation.  Both counsel made comprehensive closing arguments.  The trial
    judge briefly, but accurately, outlined the simple straightforward positions
    of the parties.  Neither counsel asked for a more detailed statement of their
    respective positions.  </p>

    is impossible for me to imagine, even in the rarefied air of the Court of
    Appeal, that any jury could not have understood the appellant’s position.  His
    position could not have been simpler or clearer – he did not sexually assault
    or threaten W.J. and she fabricated the charges to help her son.  The trial
    judge adequately dealt with the position of the parties.</p>

    trial judge said next to nothing about the evidence in his instructions.  During
    its deliberation, the jury asked two questions which indicated that they
    needed assistance in recalling parts of the evidence.  In a straightforward
    case like this, no elaborate review of the evidence is necessary.  The extent
    to which the evidence should be reviewed is very much in the discretion of
    the trial judge, particularly where counsel do not suggest that the trial
    judge should approach the evidence in a certain way in his or her instructions.  Even
    in a short case like this, however, some brief reminder of the salient points
    of the evidence and their significance to the positions of the parties would
    probably be of some assistance to this jury.  Certainly, I do not see how
    it could hurt.  In so holding, I do not suggest that the failure to review
    the evidence in this case would, standing alone, justify appellate intervention.  </p>

    also argued that the trial judge failed to give proper instructions as to
    the use that could be made of various consistent statements made by W.J.  In
    the course of the evidence, W.J. testified that she told several people about
    the attacks on her by the appellant before she finally told the police almost
    two and a half years after the first attack occurred.  W.J. identified a
    person that she said she told about the first attack within days of that
    attack.  Much of this evidence came out on cross-examination.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    cross-examination, W.J. identified a letter and what appeared to be a draft
    of the same letter.  She said that she had written the letter and delivered
    a copy of it to the appellant shortly after the incident in March.  The letter
    accused him of rape.  The defence argued that the letters were written in
    September 2003 to try and create some support for the allegations that W.J.
    had made to the police in an effort to assist her son.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was no objection to the admissibility of any of the prior consistent statements.  Nor
    was the trial judge asked to give the jury any specific instructions in respect
    of any of the statements. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    do not propose to examine the admissibility of each of the statements or
    to analyze the instructions which could have been given in respect of each
    of the statements.  I wish only to say that in a case like this one where
    credibility is important and various prior consistent statements are adduced
    in evidence, the trial judge should make it clear to the jury that the existence
    of a prior consistent statement cannot in and of itself enhance the credibility
    of the person making those statements.  Evidence does not become more credible
    because it has been repeated several times in the period between the relevant
    event and the trial: <i>R. v. Divitaris</i> (2004), 188 C.C.C. (3d) 390 at
    para. 28 (Ont. C.A.).  This instruction was of significance in a case like
    this where credibility is the crucial issue.  A jury, as reasonably intelligent
    laypersons, may well consider that consistency is a hallmark of reliability.  The
    law of evidence takes a very different view.  As my colleague, Feldman J.A.,
    put it in <i>R. v. Divitaris</i> at para. 28:  “[A] concocted statement,
    repeated on more than one occasion, remains concocted”.</p>

line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge should also have explained to the jury that the contents of the
    letters written by W.J. could not constitute evidence of the truth of the
    allegations in those letters.  The jury should have been told that the relevance
    of the letters depended on when they were written.  If the jury concluded
    they were written in September 2003, then clearly the letters supported the
    defence theory.  If the jury decided that the letters were written shortly
    after the time of the first assault, the letters refuted the suggestion that
    W.J. had fabricated the allegations in September 2003 to help her son.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellant argued that the evidence of W.J.’s son required a specific
    limiting instruction.  Once again, this request was not made at the trial.  During
    his evidence, W.J.’s son indicated that he believed that his mother had in
    fact been raped by the appellant.  His belief led him to damage the appellant’s
    apartment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    son’s opinion that his mother had in fact been sexually assaulted was irrelevant
    and of no use to the jury, except to explain why he vandalized the apartment.  That
    explanation was in turn relevant to why W.J.’s allegations came to the attention
    of the police. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    think there was a danger that the jury would use the son’s evidence to support
    the credibility of W.J.  The jury should have been told that his evidence
    was admitted only as an explanation for how the allegations came to attention
    of the police.  It would have been preferable had the jury been told that
    the son’s belief in the truthfulness of his mother’s allegations could not
    assist them in determining the verdicts.  </p>
