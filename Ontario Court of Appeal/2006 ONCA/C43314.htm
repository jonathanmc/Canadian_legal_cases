  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BY THE COURT:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was convicted of two counts of sexual assault after a nine-day
    judge alone trial.  The complainant is a twenty-five-year old developmentally
    challenged woman.  With respect to the first count, she testified that on
    the three occasions, she was a passenger on a City of North Bay bus driven
    by the appellant when the appellant forced her to perform oral sex.  The
    second count related to an incident at the appellant’s motor home.  She did
    not make the second allegation until more than a year after the initial allegations.  The
    appellant testified and denied having any sexual contact with the complainant.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US
style='font-weight:normal;'>(1) Did the trial judge misapprehend evidence bearing
        on the complainant’s credibility?</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred by misapprehending significant
    portions of the evidence that brought the complainant’s credibility into
    question.  The principal submission rests on a police occurrence report filed
    as an exhibit at trial relating to the complainant’s earlier allegation of
    sexual assault against a friend of her boyfriend.  That report indicated
    that the police had not proceeded with the charges when the complainant told
    them that the sexual encounter had been consensual and that she had lied
    to cover what she had told her father about where she was staying and because
    she feared her father would be upset with her for having sex.  The appellant
    relies on the following passage in the trial judge’s reasons</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The report by the complainant to the police made
    on June 6, 1999 was not untrue.  The sexual activity she reported did occur,
    according to the investigator’s conclusions.  The matter was not proceeded
    with because the police concluded her conduct was consistent with her consenting
    to the sexual activity.  The report by the complainant, having regard to
    her mental capacity, was not so untrue or unreliable as to impact upon her
    credibility in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that this passage indicates that the trial judge failed
    to appreciate that the appellant had lied when she made this complaint.  We
    disagree.  Earlier in his reasons, the trial judge stated: “the sexual activity
    was admitted by the complainant to have been consensual.”  In our view, this
    demonstrates that the trial judge was fully cognizant of the fact that the
    appellant had lied when she made the complaint.  It was for the trial judge
    to assess what impact that lie had on her credibility in the present case.  As
    we read his reasons, he recognized that the complainant had lied but he concluded
    that her lie was not fatal to her credibility as there had been sexual activity
    and that the motivation and manner in which she reported that activity was
    a product of her limited mental capacity.  It was for the trial judge to
    assess the impact the false complaint had on her credibility and we see no
    reason to interfere.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    are we persuaded that the trial judge erred by ignoring evidence that the
    complainant had made false complaints against other bus drivers regarding
    oral sex.  The evidence was far from clear that there had been any such complaints.  There
    were no documented complaints and the principal witness on this point was
    not entirely consistent in his evidence. The trial judge’s reasons for dismissing
    the contention that the complainant had made these complaints are somewhat
    conclusory and perhaps could have been more fully explained, but we are not
    persuaded that he erred or misapprehended the evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the trial judge did not ignore or misapprehend the evidence, we see no error
    that would permit us to substitute our view for his as to the complainant’s
    credibility.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal;'>(2) Did the trial judge unfairly discount
        the appellant’s evidence or place undue weight upon his demeanour?</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge unfairly discounted his evidence and
    placed undue weight upon what he regarded as unusual aspects of the appellant’s
    demeanour while testifying.  Again, we disagree.  There was conflicting evidence
    as to the complainant’s behaviour on city buses and the trial judge was entitled
    to find that the appellant exaggerated in this regard.  The complainant’s
    ability to describe details of the interior of the appellant’s trailer was
    clearly a crucial point for the trial judge.  The trial judge had the advantage
    of seeing the appellant testify and it was open to him to conclude that the
    appellant’s explanation for this aspect of the complainant’s evidence was
    contrived.  Similarly, the trial judge was entitled to take into account
    the appellant’s demeanour on the witness stand and as he did not reject the
    appellant’s evidence solely on the basis of his demeanour, we see no error
    that would permit us to interfere with his assessment of the appellant’s
    credibility. </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal;'>(3) Fresh
        evidence application</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant has also applied to have admitted as fresh evidence on appeal the
    evidence of two witnesses who state they overheard the complainant say to
    others that the appellant “Mike Linkie did nothing to me, it was another
    driver’ and “Mike Linkie wasn’t the one that did it, it was another driver.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent filed as reply evidence the complainant’s denial that she made
    these statements and the evidence of one named individual to whom the statements
    were allegedly made that the complainant had never told him that she had
    falsely accused the appellant.  There is no evidence of recantation from
    any person to whom the complainant spoke directly.  Moreover, an earlier
    version of this evidence was presented to the trial judge after conviction
    but prior to sentencing and he ruled that as the alleged statements were
    isolated portions of a conversation, they were insufficient to warrant reopening
    the trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are not persuaded that this evidence meets the standard required for admission
    as fresh evidence on appeal: <i>R. v. Palmer</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759:</p>
  <p align=left style='

'>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due diligence, it could
    have been adduced at trial provided that this general principle will not
    be applied as strictly in a criminal case as in civil cases;</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;
'>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears upon a decisive or potentially
    decisive issue in the trial;</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;
'>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the

    and</p>
  <p align=left style='

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>it
    must be such that, if believed, it could reasonably, when taken with the
    other evidence adduced at the trial, be expected to have affected the result.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    assuming that the evidence meets the first hurdle despite the fact that a
    version of it was considered by the trial judge, we are not persuaded that
    it meets the other three criteria.  Simply put, the alleged statements are
    taken completely out of any context that would permit a court to find that
    they amounted to a recantation of the complainant’s evidence that the appellant
    sexually assaulted her.  It is not clear that the sexual assaults at issue
    in this proceeding were the subject matter of the conversation.  As the respondent
    points out, these snippets of conversation could have been made in the context
    of a conversation about which bus drivers had thrown the complainant off
    the bus, or refused to allow her on the bus.  Even assuming the complainant
    was discussing the sexual assault allegations, the full context of the conversation
    might well have been that:  “some girl has been going around saying that
    “Mike Linkie did nothing to me, it was another driver”, a context that would
    be consistent with the complainant’s response to the fresh evidence application
    that such allegations were being made about her complaint.  Another possibility
    is that the complainant was recounting the events of the trial itself and
    the fact that the defence had brought an application to reopen the case on
    the basis of an assertion that an utterance to a similar effect had been
    made.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    cannot say that this evidence is relevant, that it is reasonably capable
    of belief or that it could reasonably be expected to have affected the result.  Accordingly,
    the application for admission of fresh evidence on appeal is dismissed. </p>
