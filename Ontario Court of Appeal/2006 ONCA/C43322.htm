    reasonable grounds to suspect a motorist is impaired are entitled to walk a
    short distance up a driveway to further their investigation.  The trial judge, Budzinski J., and the
    Summary Appeal Court judge, McCombs J., concluded that the officers were not
    entitled to walk up the driveway attached to a dwelling house to make that
    investigation.  As a result, they found
    that the respondent had been subjected to an unreasonable search and seizure
    and that the fruits of the investigation were inadmissible on the respondent’s
    trial for impaired driving and “over 80”.  In my view, they erred.  Accordingly, I would allow this Crown appeal.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
    FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the early morning hours of August 30, 2001, two uniformed
    police officers on patrol in Toronto received a call from their dispatcher that
    a suspected impaired driver had been causing trouble at the drive-through
    window of a fast-food restaurant.  The
    dispatcher informed the officers that the driver was too intoxicated to
    order.  The officers received a general
    description of the driver and the vehicle and its licence plate number.  They used their computer to identify the
    owner of the vehicle and they drove to the address associated with the vehicle,
    50 Cardigan Road.  They arrived at the
    address at 1:02 a.m. and parked in front of the residence.  One minute later, a car turned on to the
    street.  The driver of the vehicle was
    driving in an odd manner.  The driver
    was driving very slowly and stopped at one point and flashed his high-beam
    lights.  The driver resumed movement but
    then stopped a second time and finally made a slow turn into the driveway of
    the residence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once the vehicle had stopped, the officers approached the
    driver’s window.  They watched the
    driver for a few moments; he had not noticed their approach and was fumbling
    with a fast-food bag.  One of the
    officers knocked on the window.  The
    respondent left the car and leaned against the door.  The officer asked to see the respondent’s license, ownership and
    insurance.  The respondent fumbled with
    the documents and had to be asked again.  Both officers saw that the respondent was having difficulty maintaining
    his balance.  He looked somewhat
    dishevelled and his eyes appeared watery.  There was a smell of alcohol on his breath.  The officer asked the respondent how much he had to drink and the
    respondent replied that he had one beer.  At 1:05 a.m., the officer formed the opinion that the respondent’s
    ability to drive was impaired by alcohol and he was arrested for that offence
    and removed from the property.  The
    officers called for a tow truck to remove the vehicle.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The arresting officer testified that he did not stop the
    vehicle while it was on the street because he could see that it was going to
    come to a stop in the driveway.  Thus,
    the safest thing to do was to wait for it to stop rather than jump out in front
    of the vehicle on the street.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent’s father testified that the respondent lived
    with his parents at the 50 Cardigan Road address and that the respondent was
    the registered owner of the vehicle.</p>

line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that the officers had violated the
    respondent’s rights under the <i>Charter of
    Rights and Freedoms</i> because their primary purpose in entering onto the
    driveway was for investigating a criminal offence.  The trial judge relied upon the decision of Wake J. in <i>R. v. Curic</i>, [1999] O.J. No. 5786 (Ct.
    J.).  In that case, Wake J. found a
    violation of s. 8 where a police officer followed a suspected impaired driver
    on to the latter’s porch.  The trial
    judge excluded the certificate of analysis under s. 24(2), again applying <i>Curic</i>.  That ruling disposed of the “over 80” charge.  In <i>Curic</i>, Wake J. held that evidence of a refusal to
    comply with a breathalyser demand was conscriptive evidence “and based on <i>R.
    v. Stillman</i>, [<span style='color:black'>[1997] 1
    S.C.R. 607] it must be excluded” (para.&nbsp;23).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It appears that the trial judge did not exclude the officer’s
    observations of the respondent’s condition but that this evidence alone was not
    sufficient to establish that the respondent’s ability to drive was
    impaired.  Accordingly, he dismissed
    both of the charges.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>REASONS
    OF THE APPEAL COURT JUDGE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal court judge found that the respondent had a
    reasonable expectation of privacy on his driveway and thus s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i> was engaged.  He found that the officers exceeded the
    implied licence to enter on to the premises because they were investigating a
    suspected criminal offence.  Relying
    upon <i>R. v. Evans</i> (1996), 104 C.C.C.
    (3d) 23 (S.C.C.), the appeal court judge held that the conduct of the officers
    constituted a warrantless search and that the Crown had not rebutted the
    presumption that the search was unreasonable.  He also found no reason to interfere with the trial judge’s decision
    that the evidence should be excluded under s. 24(2).  He therefore dismissed the Crown appeal.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>POSITIONS
    OF THE PARTIES ON THE APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsel submits that the trial judge and the appeal
    court judge erred in law in several respects.  First, they erred in finding that the respondent had a reasonable
    expectation of privacy in respect of the driveway so as to trigger s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.  Alternatively, it is argued that the entrance on to the driveway
    was lawful and therefore there was no violation of s. 8, on one or all of the
    following bases:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The officers had an
    implied licence to walk on to the driveway.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The entrance on to the
    driveway could be justified under s. 48 of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990 c. H.8.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The officers were
    entitled to enter on to the private property under the common law ancillary
    powers doctrine (the doctrine in <i>R. v.
    Waterfield</i>, [1964] 1 Q.B. 164 (C.A.)).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, counsel for the appellant argues that the trial judge
    erred in applying a rule of automatic exclusion under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the respondent supports the decisions of the trial
    judge and the appeal court judge.  He
    submits that Crown counsel conceded at trial that the respondent had a
    reasonable expectation of privacy sufficient to invoke s. 8.  He submits that police do not have an implied
    licence to enter private property to conduct a criminal investigation; that s.
    48 applies only to investigations on a highway; and that the ancillary powers
    doctrine cannot be used to justify a warrantless entry on to private
    property.  He relies in particular on
    the <i>Evans</i> decision and the reasons of
    this court in <i>R. v. Mulligan</i> (2000),
    142 C.C.C. (3d) 14.  Finally, he argues
    that the breathalyser results were conscriptive evidence and properly excluded
    under s. 24(2).</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(a)       Was there a <i>Charter</i> breach?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The simple facts of
    this case present a surprisingly complex <i>Charter</i> issue that engage,
    among other things, the fundamental question of what constitutes a search and
    seizure for the purposes of s. 8.  The
    Supreme Court of Canada has generally taken a broad view of search and seizure,
    using such expressions as the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>“If the police activity invades a reasonable
    expectation of privacy, then the activity is a search”:  <i><span lang=EN-US>R. v. Wise</span></i><span lang=EN-US> (1992), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.) at 291.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>“</span>Accordingly,
    police conduct interfering with a reasonable expectation of privacy is said to
    constitute a &quot;search&quot; within the meaning of the provision”:  <i>R.  v. Law </i>(2002), 160 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.) at para. 15.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>“Clearly, it is only where a person's reasonable
    expectations of privacy are somehow diminished by an investigatory technique
    that s. 8 of the Charter comes into play.  As a result, not every form of examination conducted by the government
    will constitute a &quot;search&quot; for constitutional purposes.  On the contrary, only where those state
    examinations constitute an intrusion upon some reasonable privacy interest of
    individuals does the government action in question constitute a search within
    the meaning of s.&nbsp;8”:  <i>R. v.
    Evans, supra,</i> at 29.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The breadth of police activity found to constitute a search
    demonstrates the reach of the s. 8 protections.  In <i>Evans,</i> the police activity consisted of no more than
    approaching the door of the accused’s residence and knocking with the intent of
    sniffing for marijuana when the occupant opened the door.  In <i>R. v. Kokesch</i> (1990), 61 C.C.C.
    (3d) 207 (S.C.C.), the Crown conceded that the police activity in going on to
    private property to peer into windows and attempt to detect the odour of
    marijuana, constituting a so-called perimeter search, was a search within s.
    8.  There are, however, some
    limits.  It seems that merely peering
    into a car window at night with the aid of a flashlight on a public highway is
    not a search.  See <i>R. v. Mellenthin</i> (1992), 76 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.) at 486-87.  Admittedly, it is unclear whether the conduct in <i>Mellenthin</i> was
    not a search because there was no reasonable expectation of privacy or because
    the interference or intrusion was not sufficiently invasive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. Tessling</i> (2004), 189 C.C.C. (3d) 129, the
    Supreme Court of Canada identified three notions of privacy, namely: personal, territorial
    and informational privacy.  In <i>Tessling</i>,
    which involved use of infrared technology to detect heat emanations from a
    private home, both territorial and informational privacy were implicated.  In that case, Binnie J. concluded that the
    external pattern of heat distribution on the external surfaces of a house is
    not information in which the homeowner has a reasonable expectation of
    privacy.  Interestingly, in reaching
    that conclusion, he looked at the nature of the intrusion as a facet of the
    reasonable expectation of privacy analysis on the theory, it seems, that
    “privacy ‘is closely linked to the effect that a breach of that privacy would
    have on the freedom and dignity of the individual’” (referring to <i>Schreiber
    v. Canada (Attorney General)</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 841, at para. 19).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, at least until the breathalyser demand, the
    respondent invokes only territorial privacy.  He says that he has a reasonable expectation of privacy while sitting in
    his car in his parents’ driveway.  He
    does not expressly identify the intrusion that he says interfered with that
    reasonable expectation.  He says simply
    that the police conduct infringed that reasonable expectation of privacy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It seems to me that there are four elements to the police
    conduct.  First, the police walked on to
    the driveway.  Second, the police tapped
    on the window to get the respondent’s attention.  Third, the police questioned the respondent about his licence,
    ownership and insurance.  Fourth, the
    police made the breathalyser demand.  The conduct at the two ends of the spectrum can most easily be
    categorized.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The breathalyser demand was clearly a search or seizure.  The police sought by demand personal
    information.  That demand was, however,
    authorized by law and there was no attack on either the validity of the demand
    or the validity of the legislation authorizing the demand.  If, however, the police were trespassing at
    the time they made a demand, it might be argued that the demand was an
    unreasonable search and seizure.  In <i>R.
    v. Collins</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265 at 278, Lamer J. held that a search will be
    reasonable “if it is authorized by law, if the law itself is reasonable and if
    the manner in which the search was carried out is reasonable”.  It might be argued that the search was not
    carried out in a reasonable manner if the police were trespassers at the time
    they made the demand.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the other end of the spectrum, despite the breadth of the
    notion of search and seizure, merely walking on to a driveway, even with an
    intent to conduct an investigation involving the owner, does not, in my view,
    constitute a sufficient intrusion to be considered a search.  There must be something more, as in the
    perimeter search cases, peering in windows of the home and trying to detect
    odours from within.  Put another way,
    not every trespass on to private property by police can constitute a
    search.  I would not place a possible
    trespass on to a driveway open to public view in the category of a search or
    seizure.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As regards the other two aspects of the police conduct, I tend
    to think that merely tapping on the window, like peering into a window with a
    flashlight, does not involve a search.  Asking routine questions of a motorist about licence, ownership and
    insurance similarly would not seem to be the type of questioning that would
    lead to a finding of a sufficient intrusion into a reasonable expectation of
    privacy.  See <i>R. v. Grant</i>, [2006]
    O.J. 2179 (C.A.) at para. 36.  Finally,
    cases concerning questioning of motorists in drinking and driving situations
    have turned on issues such as right to counsel and detention; not search and
    seizure.  See most recently:  <i>R. v. Elias</i> (2005), 196 C.C.C. (3d)
    481 (S.C.C.).  Obviously, the fact that
    the courts have not dealt with this element of the drinking and driving
    paradigm as a search issue is not determinative, but it does suggest to me that
    in most cases the search and seizure threshold is not crossed until the
    breathalyser demand is made.  <i>Elias</i> at para. 41, is also helpful in clarifying that checking sobriety of drivers is
    lawful at common law.  If the police
    conduct was unlawful in this case it was only because it took place on the
    driveway as opposed to a public highway.  Since, as I explain below, I have concluded that the police were not
    unlawfully on the driveway, the fact that they questioned the respondent on his
    driveway to check his sobriety did not render that particular investigative
    technique unlawful.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I am of the view that the violation of the
    respondent’s s. 8 rights must relate to the fact that the police made the
    demand while they were on private property.  If, contrary to the findings of the trial judge and the appeal judge,
    the police were lawfully on the property when they made the demand, the search was
    reasonable having been authorized by a reasonable law and carried out in a
    reasonable manner.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have said, Crown counsel offers three different bases for
    justifying the officers entering on to the driveway.  I find it unnecessary to consider the second and third bases
    since I am satisfied that the entrance on to the driveway was justified by the
    implied licence doctrine.  In my view,
    this court’s decision in <i>R. v. Tricker</i> (1995), 96 C.C.C. (3d) 198 is determinative of this issue.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tricker was a police officer charged with manslaughter.  While on routine patrol, he saw a car
    speeding on a residential street.  The
    car drove on to a private driveway and into a garage.  Constable Tricker followed the car and parked on the
    driveway.  There was a confrontation on
    the driveway between the officer and the deceased.  The evidence as to what occurred was confusing.  However, on one version of the evidence, the
    officer told the deceased that he had been speeding and asked him for his
    licence and insurance papers.  The
    deceased refused to produce them and ordered the officer off his property.  When the deceased refused to identify
    himself, the officer attempted to arrest him.  The two struggled and the struggle continued into the deceased’s home
    where unfortunately the deceased died while the officer was attempting to
    restrain him.  The officer was convicted
    of manslaughter.  One of the crucial
    issues was whether the officer had a lawful reason for being on the driveway.  The Crown contended that the officer was a
    trespasser from the moment he entered on to the driveway.  This court disagreed.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Speaking for the court, Galligan J.A. held at p. 203 that “the
    occupier of a dwelling gives implied licence to any member of the public,
    including a police officer, on legitimate business to come on to the property. The
    implied licence ends at the door of the dwelling [house]”.  He further held at p. 204 that a police
    officer carrying out the statutory mandate under the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> to obtain reasonable identification of a
    motorist has lawful reason to speak to the person.  Therefore, when the officer entered on to the driveway to obtain
    the deceased’s identification he was “within the ambit of the implied licence
    recognized by the common law”.  Galligan
    J.A. noted that the property owner was entitled to withdraw the licence and if
    he did so before grounds for lawful arrest came into existence, the officer
    would have been required to leave.  </p>

    his parents’ driveway.  Thus, if the
    implied licence doctrine applied, the officers were lawfully on the property
    and there could be no violation of s. 8.  The respondent submits that the implied licence doctrine articulated in <i>Tricker</i> has been limited by the
    subsequent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Evans.</i></p>

    had received an anonymous tip that the accused were growing marijuana in their
    home.  After an investigation that did
    not disclose any illegality, the officers decided to knock on the door and
    question the occupants regarding the complaint.  They knocked on the door and when one of the accused opened the
    door, the officers smelled marijuana.  They arrested the accused. </p>

    this court’s decision in <i>Tricker </i>and
    quoted with approval this excerpt from that case:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The law is clear
    that the occupier of a dwelling gives implied licence to any member of the
    public, including a police officer, on legitimate business to come on to the
    property. The implied licence ends at the door of the dwelling. This
    proposition was laid down by the English Court of Appeal in <i>Robson v. Hallett</i>, [1967] 2 All E.R.
    407, [1967] 2 Q.B. 939.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sopinka J. then drew this conclusion:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>As a result, the
    occupier of a residential dwelling is deemed to grant the public permission to
    approach the door and knock. Where the police act in accordance with this
    implied invitation, they cannot be said to intrude upon the privacy of the
    occupant. The implied invitation, unless rebutted by a clear expression of
    intent, effectively waives the privacy interest that an individual might
    otherwise have in the approach to the door of his or her dwelling.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two issues present themselves.  First, when are police acting in accordance with the implied
    invitation?  Second, do the same limitations
    on the implied invitation doctrine apply to the driveway as to the dwelling
    house?  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In resolving these issues I think it important to bear in mind
    the differences between this case and <i>Tricker</i> and the <i>Evans</i> case.  In the <i>Evans</i> case, the conduct sought to be brought within the implied licence doctrine was
    the knocking on the door of the dwelling house to investigate a criminal
    offence.  In <i>Tricker</i> and in this case, the conduct sought to be justified was
    investigation on a driveway.  Thus, in <i>Evans, </i>after referring to <i>Tricker</i>, Sopinka J. applied the implied
    licence doctrine to the police actions in conducting an investigation that
    required questioning of the occupant in his own home.  This case and <i>Tricker,</i> however, do not include the greater level of intrusion found in <i>Evans </i>and
    do not depend upon licence to question occupants of the dwelling house, only to
    conduct an investigation on the driveway.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To return to <i>Evans</i>,
    Sopinka J. held at para. 15 that in determining the scope of activities that
    are authorized “by the implied invitation to knock” it is important to bear in
    mind the purpose of the implied invitation.  He held that the implied invitation to knock is “to facilitate
    communication between the public and the <i>occupant</i>”
    [emphasis added]”.  At para. 16, he
    found that the police approached the home “not merely out of a desire to
    communicate with the occupants, but also in the hope of securing evidence
    against them”.  He concluded as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Clearly, <i>occupiers
    of a dwelling</i> cannot be presumed to invite the police (or anyone else) to
    approach their home for the purpose of substantiating a criminal charge against
    them. Any &quot;waiver&quot; of privacy rights that can be implied through the
    &quot;invitation to knock&quot; simply fails to extend that far. As a result,
    where the agents of the state <i>approach a dwelling</i> with the intention of
    gathering evidence against the occupant, the police have exceeded any authority
    that is implied by the invitation to knock. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At para. 18, Sopinka J., after referring to the participant
    surveillance cases, summed up the law in this way:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Similarly, where
    the police, as here, purport to rely on the invitation to knock and approach a
    dwelling for the purpose, <i>inter alia</i>,
    of securing evidence against the occupant, they have exceeded the bounds of any
    implied invitation and <i>are engaging in a search of the occupant's home</i>.
    Since the implied invitation is for a specific purpose, the invitee's purpose
    is all-important in determining whether his or her activity is authorized by
    the invitation. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, there is a fundamental difference between the
    police conduct of knocking on the door of a dwelling house to investigate the
    occupants discussed in <i>Evans</i> and
    merely entering on to a driveway.  The
    latter does not involve an investigation of persons in their own home.  A driveway is not a dwelling house; it is a
    place where people drive and park their vehicles.  It is an open area that is visible to the public.  The scope of the implied invitation must be
    analyzed in that context. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Sharpe J.A. said in <i>R.
    v. Mulligan</i> at para. 24, the holdings in <i>Tricker</i> and <i>Evans</i> are
    examples of a broader principle; that licences “may arise at common law by
    implication from the nature of the use to which the owner puts the property”.  In <i>Mulligan</i>,
    the court held that a police officer was entitled to enter a parking lot
    attached to commercial premises to investigate a possible break-in of the
    premises.  As he said, “a police officer
    may assume that entry for that purpose is by the implied invitation of the
    owner, particularly where entry is limited to areas of the property to which
    the owner has extended a general invitation to all members of the public”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the respondent fairly points out that in <i>Mulligan</i> the officer did not have an
    intention to investigate criminal activity of the owner or occupant of the
    property and had no intention to secure incriminating evidence against the
    owner or occupier.  In <i>Mulligan</i>, it was unnecessary to consider
    what the result would have been had the officer had such an intention.  The case, in my view, does not, however,
    stand for the proposition that had the officer had such an intention, no matter
    the circumstances, the entry would have turned into a trespass.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fact that the police officer intends to pursue an
    investigation on the driveway, at least if the investigation relates to a motor
    vehicle, does not in my view exceed the bounds of the implied invitation,
    provided that the officer has a legitimate basis for entering on the driveway.  Interpreting the common law in this way is,
    in my view, consistent with the broader principle identified by Sharpe J.A.
    that licences may arise by implication from the nature of the use to which the
    owner puts the property.  As I have
    said, the use to which this property is put is to park motor vehicles and it is
    an area of the property that is open to public view.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The officers in this case had a legitimate basis for entering
    on the driveway.  They had received a
    report that the driver of the car associated with the address was apparently
    impaired.  The driver drove the vehicle
    in an unusual fashion as he approached the driveway.  The officers would have been entitled to stop the vehicle on the
    street under s.&nbsp;48(1) of the <i>Highway
    Traffic Act</i>.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a>  For reasons of safety, they waited until the
    motorist had brought the vehicle safely to a stop.  This was a reasonable decision to make.  It makes no sense that because the officers exercised a
    reasonable degree of caution their actions should be characterized as illegitimate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are other reasons for viewing the officers’ actions as
    legitimately within the scope of the implied licence.  It would not be good
    policy to interpret the law as encouraging motorists to avoid the reach of
    legitimate traffic investigations by heading for home and thus encouraging
    a high-speed police chase.  Further, until the impaired driving complaint
    was investigated there was a risk that an impaired driver would re-enter
    the vehicle and drive while impaired.  It is not reasonable to expect the
    police to devote resources to waiting outside the motorist’s house until
    he or she returns to the street.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I acknowledge that there is a countervailing policy.  It is always possible that a property owner
    may engage in an altercation with the police because of a mistaken view of the
    scope of the common law property rights; <i>Tricker</i> is obviously an extreme example of what can happen.  Counsel for the respondent suggests that there is, therefore,
    value in drawing a bright line around the entire property and prohibiting any
    police entry where the purpose is to investigate criminal activity by the
    property owner.  On the other hand, the
    implied licence is easily withdrawn simply by the occupier telling the officer
    to leave.  The officer must then leave,
    unless he or she acquired grounds to make an arrest before that time.  Further, even the rule proposed by the
    respondent is not as clear as it appears.  The lawfulness of the officer’s entry on the driveway still would depend
    upon the officer’s purpose, which may or may not be apparent to the
    occupier.  Regrettably, in this area,
    like so many others involved in constitutional litigation it is not always
    possible to draw bright lines and the best courts can do is give a reasonable
    common sense interpretation to the law that is relatively easy to apply.</p>

line-height:normal'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In that vein, I note that there are several decisions from
    trial and summary appeal courts that support the proposition that the officers
    acted lawfully in this case.  In <i>R. v. Soal</i> (2005), 19 M.V.R. (5<sup>th</sup>)
    176, this court upheld the decision of Durno J. (2005), 14 M.V.R. (5<sup>th</sup>)
    256 (Ont. S.C.J.) made on facts very similar to this case.  In <i>Soal</i>,
    the police received a call that an intoxicated man had left a bar in his
    vehicle.  As in this case, the officer
    went to the address associated with the vehicle where she found the vehicle
    parked in the driveway.  The vehicle was
    running.  The officer went up to the
    vehicle and found the driver apparently passed out in the driver’s seat.  After the man left the vehicle, the officer
    formed the belief he was impaired and she made a breathalyser demand.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Durno J. held that the police officer was entitled to enter on
    to the driveway to investigate the driver.  As I have done here, he found it important to distinguish between
    entering on to private property and entering a dwelling house.  He relied upon <i>Tricker</i> to find that the police officers have the right to enter
    private property to conduct an investigation in some circumstances.  Durno J. also referred to several cases with
    almost identical facts to this case where courts have upheld the lawfulness of
    the police conduct.  See <i>R. v. Maciel</i>, [2003] O.J. No. 126 (Ct.

    v. Johnson</i> (1994), 45 B.C.A.C. 102 at para. 8 where on facts very like this
    case the British Columbia Court of Appeal found “that the driveway leading to

    in accordance with an implied invitation.  They were not asked to leave the property before they formed reasons for
    arresting the respondent and making a breathalyser demand.  For these reasons, I am of the view that the
    respondent’s rights under s. 8 were not violated.  </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(b)            Exclusion of the evidence</span></h4>

    whether the trial judge erred in his application of s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  However, I should not be taken as agreeing with the view of the
    trial judge that the decision in <i>R. v. Curic</i> determined the issue of
    admissibility of the breathalyser results.  First, in <i>Curic</i>, the evidence sought to be excluded was a
    statement.  Admission of a statement is

    and more importantly, it would appear that the trial judge in <i>Curic</i> interpreted <i>R.
    v. Stillman</i> as providing for an
    automatic rule of exclusion of conscriptive evidence.  As is made clear in
    more recent decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada, most notably in the
    concurring opinion of LeBel J. in <i>R. v.
    Orbanski; R. v. Elias</i>, [2005] 2&nbsp;S.C.R. 3, the fact that evidence
    is conscriptive does not necessarily mean that admission of the evidence
    would render the trial unfair.  In any event,
    the trial court must still consider the seriousness of the violation and
    the effect of exclusion, even of conscriptive evidence.  It is only after
    considering all three sets of <i>Collins</i> factors<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span

    whether admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice

    made no finding that the officers were acting in bad faith.  Even it I am wrong and there was a violation
    of s. 8, it was because of a minor trespass on to a driveway.  Had the officers exercised their powers
    under the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>, as they were fully entitled to do, or had
    the respondent parked his vehicle at the curb instead of in the driveway, there
    would have been no violation of the <i>Charter</i>.  The respondent did not dispute that the breathalyser demand was
    otherwise properly made, the officers had reasonable grounds to make the
    demand, and before he was required to comply with the demand the respondent was
    informed of his right to counsel.  In
    those circumstances, the seriousness of the violation factors would have
    strongly favoured admission of the evidence.</p>
