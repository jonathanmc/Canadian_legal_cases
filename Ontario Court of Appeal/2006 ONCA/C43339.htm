  <h2>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent did not appear on this appeal. However, based on material filed
    by the Crown, we are satisfied that he was served personally with the Crown’s
    Notice of Appeal and factum and, as early as April 26, 2006, with a letter
    from the Crown specifying the hearing date for this appeal. Neither the Crown
    nor this court has received any communication from the respondent. Given
    the foregoing circumstances, we proceeded with the appeal in his absence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown raised four issues on this appeal against the respondent’s acquittals
    on charges of aggravated assault and assault with a weapon. In our view,
    the first two issues are dispositive of the appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Issue One </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her reasons for acquitting the respondent, the trial judge reviewed the evidence
    at trial. After doing so, she said: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>To reject Mr. Hull’s evidence and or to say that
    it does not raise a reasonable doubt requires me to cogently explain why
    I have done this. In this case, it would in large part require me to compare
    his evidence to [the complainant’s]. It would amount to a comparison of ‘he
    says, she says<i>’</i>. That is <i>not an appropriate way to assess</i> <i>the
    evidence</i> in a criminal trial. [emphasis added]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, this paragraph of the trial judge’s reasons indicates that she
    may have misconstrued the effect of various authorities that address concerns
    relating to the application of the standard of proof. In addition, it indicates
    the trial judge failed to carry out her duty to evaluate the respondent’s
    evidence in the context of all of the evidence adduced at trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>W.
      (D.)</i><a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a><i> </i>and
      other authorities prohibit triers of fact from treating the standard of
      proof as a credibility contest. Put another way, they prohibit a trier
      of fact from concluding that the standard of proof has been met simply
      because the trier of fact prefers the evidence of Crown witnesses to that
      of defence witnesses. However, such authorities do not prohibit a trier
      of fact from assessing an accused’s testimony in light of the whole evidence,
      including the testimony of the complainant, and in so doing comparing the
      evidence of the witnesses. On the contrary, triers of fact have a positive
      duty to carry out such an assessment recognizing that one possible outcome
      of the assessment is that the trier of fact may be left with a reasonable
      doubt concerning the guilt of the accused. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our respectful view, in this case, the trial judge concluded erroneously
    that she was prohibited from comparing the respondent’s evidence to that
    of the complainant in order to assess the respondent’s testimony. Further,
    as a result of her erroneous conclusion, she failed to carry out her duty
    to assess the respondent’s evidence in the context of the whole of the evidence
    adduced at trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Issue Two</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Elsewhere
    in her reasons the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As Mr. Hull testified, particularly when he was
    cross-examined, he became more agitated. There were noticeable pauses, some
    for more than thirty seconds, before he answered questions. On some occasions
    he challenged the Crown to explain why she was asking the question. He did
    however answer the questions. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>One could reasonably infer from this that Mr. Hull
    was trying to out-think [the Crown] and come up with an answer that would
    not hurt him …  It could also be said that he was just being careful. It
    is dangerous to draw conclusions or inferences from demeanour. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    this court said in <i>R. v. Boyce</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 4313 at para. 3:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]rial judges are not required to ignore demeanour
    in their assessment of a witness. They can use it in conjunction with their
    assessment of all the evidence and in the full context of the trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    in making the blanket statement that she did concerning the use of demeanour
    evidence, in our view, the trial judge focussed improperly on the issue of
    demeanour in isolation and, as a result, overstated the cautions relating
    to the use of demeanour. In so doing, she erred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Conclusion</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on the combined effect of these two errors, we would order a new trial. It
    is therefore unnecessary that we consider the Crown’s remaining grounds of
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, the appeal is allowed, the respondent’s acquittals are set aside,
    and a new trial is ordered.</p>
