    appellant, Jameel Mohammed, appeals the order of Justice Wilton-Siegel. That 
    order dismissed the appellant&#8217;s motion to set aside minutes of settlement, 
    which resolved the issues between the parties, and a resulting consent order, 
    which dismissed the appellant&#8217;s action against the respondent without costs. 
    For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the motion judge was correct 
    to dismiss the appellant&#8217;s motion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Accordingly, 
    I would dismiss the appeal. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>In 
    October 1998, the appellant sued his insurer, York Fire &amp; Casualty Insurance 
    Company (York), claiming payment under his fire insurance policy. That policy 
    insured the appellant&#8217;s Haliburton property, which was destroyed by fire in 
    October 1997. York defended on the basis that the appellant had deliberately 
    set fire to his property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>In 
    December 1998, partly as a result of information from York, the appellant 
    was charged with arson endangering life and with arson for a fraudulent purpose. 
    After a seven-day trial, the appellant was convicted in September 2001. The 
    appellant appealed. To obtain legal aid funding for his appeal, he sought 
    an opinion on the merits of his appeal from a senior criminal counsel. That 
    letter provided particulars about the issues to be raised on the appeal and 
    gave a persuasive opinion that the appeal had considerable merit. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>After 
    the convictions and before the appeal, the appellant&#8217;s civil action was scheduled 
    for trial. The appellant was represented on the civil matter by a senior experienced 
    insurance counsel. At trial scheduling court on November 7, 2001, the appellant 
    sought an adjournment of the civil trial pending his criminal appeal. The 
    adjournment was refused. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>On 
    November 26, 2001, the parties appeared for trial. In raising preliminary 
    issues, the appellant again requested an adjournment. In the alternative, 
    he sought an order, which was resisted by York, that his criminal convictions 
    be inadmissible in the civil trial. Also, as a preliminary matter, both counsel 
    indicated to the trial judge that a further pre-trial would be helpful. The 
    parties did not seek a ruling on the adjournment or on the admissibility of 
    the convictions before proceeding to the pre-trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>The 
    trial judge heard argument on both the adjournment and the use to be made, 
    if any, of the criminal convictions. On the admissibility of the criminal 
    convictions, York&#8217;s counsel presented the trial judge and the appellant&#8217;s 
    counsel with two authorities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>York&#8217;s 
    counsel said that the authorities stood for the principle that, despite the 
    pending appeal, the convictions were admissible as <i>prima facie</i> evidence 
    that the appellant had intentionally caused the fire. He also argued that 
    the convictions were a factor for the trial judge to consider along with all 
    the other evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>Neither 
    the appellant&#8217;s lawyer nor the trial judge had the opportunity to read the 
    two authorities at the time the motion was argued, although it appears that 
    the appellant&#8217;s counsel may have read them during a recess. When counsel returned 
    to court, the appellant&#8217;s counsel argued that even if the convictions might 
    be admissible in another case, in this case the appellant had a persuasive 
    opinion that there was merit to his appeal. In that circumstance, the admission 
    of the convictions would give rise to a real danger of inconsistent verdicts. 
  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>A 
    reading of the transcript indicates that the trial judge was alert to the 
    relevant issues. After argument, the trial judge reserved her decision on 
    both the adjournment and the admissibility of the convictions. She told counsel 
    that she would review the authorities. Such a review may have led the trial 
    judge to conclude that the convictions should be given little or no weight 
    in the circumstances of this case or that, alternatively, the requested adjournment 
    should be granted. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>In 
    the meantime, however, the parties proceeded to a pre-trial, which was conducted 
    by the civil team leader. The appellant had three problems that affected his 
    readiness for trial. First, he had no expert report on the cause of the fire 
    to counter York&#8217;s expert report that supported arson. Second, the appellant&#8217;s 
    lawyer had notified the appellant that he would seek to remove himself from 
    the record unless appropriate arrangements were made for his retainer. Third, 
    the appellant had the problem presented by his criminal convictions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> During the course of the pre-trial, the parties discussed the criminal 
    convictions. On the facts underlying the convictions that were related to 
    him, the pre-trial judge expressed the view that, even if the trial judge 
    did not consider the criminal convictions, there appeared to be enough evidence 
    about the fire that the appellant would have &#8220;a very difficult case&#8221;.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'> [1] </span></span></a> 
    After meeting with both counsel, the pre-trial judge met alone with the appellant 
    and his counsel. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> After meeting with the pre-trial judge, counsel agreed to a settlement 
    involving the dismissal of the appellant&#8217;s action without costs, costs that 
    would otherwise have been extensive. Counsel for York obtained instructions 
    from his client to accept the settlement. Minutes of settlement were signed 
    by both counsel and also, at least on their face, by the appellant. Counsel 
    then attended before the trial judge who dismissed the action on consent without 
    costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Sixteen months later, in March 2003, this court overturned the appellant&#8217;s 
    convictions. The trial judge&#8217;s reasons in the criminal trial suggested that 
    he treated his rejection of the appellant&#8217;s evidence as positive evidence 
    of guilt without any analysis of the Crown&#8217;s evidence. This court ordered 
    a new trial on two bases: the inadequacy of the trial judge&#8217;s reasons and 
    a failure by the trial judge to consider the evidence in accordance with <i>R. 
    v. W.(D.)</i> (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.).<span style="mso-spacerun:

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The appellant then moved in this proceeding to set aside the settlement 
    and the consent order. His motion was adjourned pending the outcome of the 
    criminal re-trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In January 2004, at the re-trial, the Crown withdrew the charges against 
    the appellant. According to the appellant, the charges were withdrawn because 
    there was no credible evidence to support a conviction. The appellant did 
    not provide this court with a transcript of the re-trial or the reasons for 
    the withdrawal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The appellant&#8217;s motion to set aside the settlement and the consent 
    dismissal order was heard in June 2004 and dismissed in August 2004. This 
    appeal followed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;mso-list:none'><b

bold'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> The motion judge dismissed the motion because the appellant 
    failed to establish that he did not sign the minutes of settlement and because 
    there was no fraud or fresh evidence to justify setting aside the settlement. 
    He also concluded that the parties had not entered into the settlement as 
    a result of common mistake. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In my view, the appellant&#8217;s appeal cannot succeed. The appellant alleged 
    four errors in the findings of the motion judge. First, the motion judge erred 
    in finding that the appellant agreed to the settlement. Second, the motion 
    judge erred in failing to find that the parties entered into the settlement 
    as a result of a common mistake as to the admissibility of the convictions. 
    Third, the motion judge failed to give adequate weight to facts that arose 
    after the settlement that were unavailable at the time of the settlement and 
    that warranted the setting aside of the settlement and consent order.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Fourth, the settlement was unconscionable. I will address these issues 
    in the order that they were argued.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;mso-list:none'><i><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>(i) Was the appellant a party to the

    </span></span> On the first issue, the appellant denied that the signature 
    on the minutes of settlement was his and accused the respondent&#8217;s lawyer of 
    forgery. The respondent&#8217;s lawyer filed an affidavit in which he deposed that 
    he both heard the appellant&#8217;s counsel read the minutes of settlement to the 
    appellant and that he saw the appellant sign that document. The motion judge 
    found as a fact that the appellant had given instructions to his counsel to 
    settle the case and had signed the minutes of settlement. <i></i></p>

    of fact are entitled to deference. There were significant issues surrounding 
    the appellant&#8217;s credibility. In my view, there was evidence on which the motion

    agreed upon by the appellant. <i></i></p>

    </span></span> In any event, irrespective of the conflicting evidence as to 
    the appellant&#8217;s signature, the appellant did not dispute his counsel&#8217;s retainer. 
    He did not deny that his lawyer signed the minutes of settlement or consented 
    to the dismissal of his action without costs. In those circumstances, the 
    settlement was binding on the appellant absent reason to set it aside.<span

    </span> A contract depends on an agreement between the parties as to the terms 
    of the contract or as to the assumptions underlying the contract. In this

    </span> I see no mistake that would warrant setting aside the settlement and 
    the dismissal order. In this case, both parties were aware of the convictions. 
    Given the letter of opinion, both parties would reasonably have assumed that 
    the appeal was likely to be successful. Accordingly, there was no mistake 
    on this issue. The only possible mistake was an error by York&#8217;s counsel in 
    his interpretation of the two authorities presented. </p>

    </span></span> The appellant argues that York&#8217;s mistaken interpretation of 
    the authorities led to an adoption of that mistake by the appellant&#8217;s counsel, 
    the trial judge, and the pre-trial judge. This misinterpretation, he says, 
    led the appellant to settle his action when he ought not to have done so. 
    This argument fails for a number of reasons. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

    </span></span> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>First, the respondent&#8217;s 
    interpretation of the authorities must be considered in its context of a legal 
    argument made to the trial judge. In that argument, the respondent&#8217;s counsel 
    submitted that the convictions were admissible as <i>prima facie</i> evidence 
    of arson. For this, he relied on two cases: <i>Persad v. State Farm Fire</i>, 
    [1998] I.L.R. I-3582 (Ont. Gen. Div.) and <i>Ottenbrite v. State Farm and 
    Casualty Co.</i>,<i> </i>[2001] I.L.R. I-4003 (Ont. S.C.J.).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span><i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> In fact, <i>Persad</i> does stand for the principle advanced 
    by the respondent. In that case, the trial judge specifically relied on <i>Demeter 
    v. British Pacific Life Insurance Company</i> (1984), 13 D.L.R. (4th) 318 
    (Ont. C.A.), aff&#8217;g (1983), 150 D.L.R. (3d) 249 (H.C.J.) for the principle 
    that a criminal conviction is <i>prima facie </i>evidence of guilt, subject 
    to certain rebuttal evidence. However, the trial judge in <i>Persad</i> went 
    on to consider that, unlike in <i>Demeter</i>, the case before him involved 
    a conviction that was under appeal. He said:<i></i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Accordingly, it is my view that I should consider 
    the evidence without regard to the fact of that conviction and, indeed, ignoring 
    that conviction to determine whether or not the defence has been established 
    on the balance of probabilities<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>(at 
    5170).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The trial judge in <i>Ottenbrite</i> similarly relied on <i>Demeter.</i> 
    He<i> </i>recognized the admissibility of a criminal conviction in a subsequent 
    civil trial. As in <i>Persad</i>, the <i>Ottenbrite</i> trial judge nonetheless 
    said that he would &#8220;consider the evidence without regard for the fact of those 
    convictions and determine whether or not a defence [had] been established 
    on a balance of probabilities&#8221; (para. 10).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In the result, in both cases and irrespective of the convictions, 
    the defence proved arson on a balance of probabilities. Neither case stands 
    authoritatively for the principle, as argued by the appellant, that a conviction 
    pending appeal is inadmissible in a civil trial. That may have been the conclusion 
    reached by the trial judge in this case if the appellant had awaited her ruling. 
    It may also have been the conclusion of this court on any subsequent appeal. 
    The appellant, however, chose neither to await the ruling nor to appeal its 
    result. All that he had was the argument of counsel. In any event, there was 
    no evidence that the appellant&#8217;s counsel failed to read the authorities either 
    in the earlier court recess or prior to the pre-trial. Moreover, in encouraging 
    settlement, the pre-trial judge focussed on the facts surrounding the fire 
    rather than on the convictions. Accordingly, in my view, there was no mistake 
    of the nature necessary to set aside the settlement and the order. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Second, even if the respondent&#8217;s statement of the law to the trial 
    judge was a misinterpretation of the authorities (there was no suggestion 
    of a deliberate misstatement), nothing turned on that error.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is so because the parties attended at 
    the agreed-upon pre-trial subsequent to the motion. At the pre-trial, with 
    the advice of counsel, the appellant decided to settle his action without 
    the trial judge&#8217;s ruling on the evidentiary issue or the adjournment. When 
    they began the pre-trial, the parties knew about the outstanding convictions, 
    the pending appeal, and likely success of that appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Third, even if the respondent&#8217;s lawyer erred in his interpretation 
    of the law before the trial judge, there is no evidence that the appellant, 
    his counsel, or the pre-trial judge relied on that misinterpretation in arriving 
    at the settlement. Indeed, and importantly, the only evidence of the discussion 
    with the pre-trial judge was that, regardless of the convictions, the appellant 
    had an uphill battle on the circumstances of the fire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Accordingly, it appears unlikely that the fact of the convictions drove 
    the pre-trial judge&#8217;s opinion of the merits of the civil case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>There were other reasons why the appellant may have chosen to settle 
    the case. In addition to the apparently adverse facts underlying the convictions, 
    the appellant had no expert report and he had difficulty with the retainer 
    for his counsel. Finally, he risked an adverse costs award in the event that 
    his claim was unsuccessful. Even if any opinion given by the pre-trial judge 
    is relevant or admissible,<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn3' href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:
footnote'> [3] </span></span></a> the appellant has failed to establish that the 
    pre-trial judge erred in his consideration of the law. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Moreover, even if the pre-trial judge erred in his analysis of the 
    law, in the circumstances of this case, that error could not form a ground 
    to set aside the settlement or subsequent dismissal because the appellant 
    relied on his own counsel for advice on whether the settlement was reasonable. 
  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Finally, if the appellant&#8217;s counsel erred on the law, and I say &#8220;if&#8221; 
    because this is not clear on the record, and if that error caused the appellant 
    to settle, then that is a matter between the appellant and his then counsel. 
    It is not a matter between the appellant and York.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>York was not present when the appellant and 
    his counsel met with the pre-trial judge and was not privy to the contents 
    of their discussion or the various reasons that led the appellant to agree 
    to the settlement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Accordingly, the appellant&#8217;s argument of common mistake fails.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;mso-list:none'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span><i>(iii) Is there fresh evidence on

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The appellant argues that his subsequent success in overturning his 
    convictions constitutes fresh evidence that required the motion judge to exercise 
    his equitable discretion to set aside the minutes of settlement and the consent 
    order. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Minutes of settlement are a contract. A consent judgment is binding. 
    Both are final, subject to reasons to set them aside. Finality is important 
    in litigation. This is so for the sake of the parties who reached their bargain 
    on the premise of an allocation of risk, and with an implicit understanding 
    that they will accept the consequences of their settlement. Finality is also 
    important for society at large, which recognizes the need to limit the burdens 
    placed on justice resources by re-litigation, a limitation reflected in the 
    doctrine of <i>res judicata</i>: See <i>Tsaoussis</i> <i>(Litigation Guardian 
    of) v. Baetz</i> (1998), 165 D.L.R. (4th) 268 at paras. 15, 17, 18 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> For these reasons, the avenues to set aside a settlement and consent 
    dismissal are restricted. Rule 59.06 sets out the procedure for setting aside 
    such an order. It provides that a party may bring a motion in the original 
    proceeding to &#8220;have an order set aside or varied on the ground of fraud or 
    of facts arising or discovered after it was made&#8221;.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> However, this court has said that the rule, while providing an expeditious 
    procedure to determine whether an order should be set aside, does not prescribe 
    or delineate a particular test: <i>Tsaoussis </i>at para. 39. Rather, to succeed, 
    &#8220;[t]he appellant must demonstrate circumstances which warrant deviation from 
    the fundamental principle that a final judgment, unless appealed, marks the 
    end of the litigation line&#8221; (para. 20). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> This case is analogous to <i>Tsaoussis</i>, which also considered 
    the consequences of a change in circumstances following a judgment. There, 
    two years after a judgment approving the settlement of a minor&#8217;s personal 
    injury claim, a motion was brought on behalf of the minor to set aside the 
    judgment on the basis that the child&#8217;s injuries were more extensive than had 
    been expected. The minor&#8217;s motion was dismissed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In <i>Tsaoussis</i>, this court confirmed the importance of finality 
    in litigation at para. 20:<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn4' href="#_ftn4"
name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'> [4] </span></span></a></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Attempts, whatever their form, to reopen matters 
    which are the subject of a final judgment must be carefully scrutinized. It 
    cannot be enough in personal injury litigation to simply say that something 
    has occurred or has been discovered after judgment became final which shows 
    that the judgment awards too much or too little. On that approach, finality 
    would become an illusion. The applicant must demonstrate circumstances which 
    warrant deviation from the fundamental principle that a final judgment, unless 
    appealed, marks the end of litigation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In terms of rule 59.06(2)(a), the court in <i>Tsaoussis</i> stated 
    at para. 44:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>These and numerous other authorities (e.g. <i>Whitehall 
    Development Corp. v. Walker</i>) recognize that the finality principle must 
    not yield unless the moving party can show that the new evidence could not 
    have been put forward by the exercise of reasonable diligence at the proceedings 
    which led to the judgment the moving party seeks to set aside. If that hurdle 
    is cleared, the court will go on to evaluate other factors such as the cogency 
    of the new evidence, any delay in moving to set aside the previous judgment, 
    any difficulty in re-litigating the issues and any prejudice to other parties 
    or persons who may have acted in reliance on the judgment. The onus will be 
    on the moving party to show that all of the circumstances are such as to justify 
    making an exception to the fundamental rule that final judgments are exactly 
    that, final. In a personal injury case, new evidence demonstrating that the 
    plaintiff was inadequately compensated cannot, standing alone, meet that onus 
    [citations omitted].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> In my view, in this case, new evidence that the appellant succeeded 
    in overcoming his criminal convictions falls short of meeting the required 
    onus. I say this for several reasons. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> First, at the time of the consent order, the appellant knew that he 
    likely had a meritorious appeal. Thus, the ultimate result leading to the 
    withdrawal of charges was within the appellant&#8217;s expectations. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Second, that the charges against him were ultimately withdrawn is 
    irrelevant. Even if the appellant had been acquitted of the charges, this 
    would not have affected the civil trial. If the Crown had failed to prove 
    arson on the criminal standard of proof, this does not mean that York would 
    not have proven arson on the civil standard, even on the higher degree of 
    scrutiny required to establish such conduct in a civil case.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>See <i>Tsalamatas v. Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Co.</i> (1982), 141 
    D.L.R. (3d) 322 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 6. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Third, the appellant was represented by experienced counsel and decided 
    to take the advice of that counsel. His acceptance of that advice is understandable 
    in the face of his other problems in the civil case with respect to an expert 
    report and his counsel&#8217;s retainer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Fourth, after the settlement, the appellant took no steps to set it 
    aside or take any other action for eighteen months. Since he knew that his 
    criminal appeal was likely meritorious, his delay is not adequately explained.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Fifth, the appellant&#8217;s delay inherently prejudices the insurer. With 
    such a delay, it is presumed that there may be a loss of potential witnesses 
    and that the memory of witnesses will be affected. In this case, that prejudice 
    is exacerbated because the onus was on York to establish arson against the 
    appellant. Finally, further prejudice in this case could arise because the 
    civil matter would proceed to trial, at the earliest, ten years after the 
    cause of action first arose.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span></p>
