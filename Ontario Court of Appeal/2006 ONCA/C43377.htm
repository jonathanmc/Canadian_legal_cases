  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge correctly recognized that Theodore Vigod’s evidence was crucial
    to the Crown’s case against the appellant.  Vigod was a dangerous witness
    for several reasons:</p>
  <p>(1)            He was involved in the robbery. </p>
  <p>(2)            When he testified against the appellant the charges against
    him arising from the robbery remained outstanding and he stood to gain by
    assisting the prosecution of the appellant.</p>
  <p>(3)            He admitted that he was prepared to say pretty much anything
    to stay out of jail.</p>
  <p>(4)            He admitted that before he identified the appellant as a
    participant in the robbery the police asked him to confirm that the appellant
    was a participant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also properly recognized that Vigod’s evidence had to be approached “with
    great caution”.  However, the trial judge accepted Vigod’s evidence “in spite
    of these red flags” because (1) his evidence was consistent that the appellant
    was involved in the robbery, (2) he was prepared to testify as to the appellant’s
    involvement in the appellant’s presence and in the presence of the appellant’s
    family, and (3) that by his demeanour he did not appear to be lying. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    we agree with the respondent that the trial judge also identified certain
    aspects of the evidence that tended to confirm the appellant’s involvement
    in the robbery, we are persuaded that the three reasons identified above
    were significant factors leading him to accept Vigod’s evidence and convict
    the appellant.  In our view, consistency, openly confronting the accused
    and demeanour were not factors that provided an appropriate basis to overcome
    the dangers of relying on Vigod’s evidence.  Most accomplices are consistent
    and do not retract on the stand; most openly confront the accused with their
    evidence; and demeanour does not usually provide a sound basis upon which
    to assess such evidence: see <i>R. v. Sauve and Trudel </i>(2004), 182 (3d)
    321 (Ont. C.A.).  Taking the trial judge’s reasons at face value, we cannot
    say that he would have accepted Vigod’s evidence but for these factors.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>2. <i>Recent Possession</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge applied the “doctrine of recent possession” as a factor leading
    him to convict the appellant.  When explaining the significance of the appellant’s
    possession of stolen goods the trial judge referred three times to the “presumption” of
    fact raised by the doctrine of recent possession, twice to the “burden” it
    imposed on the appellant to explain his possession, as well as to the need
    to “rebut” the presumption. It is well established that it is an error in
    law for the trier of fact to treat recent possession as creating a “presumption”: <i>R.
    v. Kowlyk</i> (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    we agree with the respondent that the trial judge correctly stated the significance
    of recent possession in certain passages of his judgment, in the end, we
    are left with what is at best a legally confused analysis of the significance
    of the evidence of recent possession in this case: see <i>R. v. Langille</i> (1990),
    59 C.C.C. (3d) 544 (Ont. C.A.). </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>3. <i>Post Offence Conduct</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge relied on evidence that the appellant had disposed of a cell
    phone that was in his possession and that had been taken in the robbery after
    he learned the police had come to his house looking for the cell phone.  The
    trial judge treated this evidence as having significant probative value of
    the appellant’s involvement in the robbery.  He described it as “the topper”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the trial judge erred in this regard.  The appellant’s evidence
    was that he had purchased the cell phone from Vigod the day after the robbery
    knowing or suspecting that it had been stolen.  This was a case where the
    appellant’s post-offence conduct could be equally explained by reference
    to consciousness of guilt for the offence of possession of stolen property
    and the trial judge erred by attributing to it significant probative value
    in relation to the offence of robbery: see <i>R. v. Arcangioli</i> (1994),
    87 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (S.C.C.). </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>4. <i>Conclusion</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    we do not say that any one of the errors we have identified standing by itself
    would necessarily have required us to set aside the convictions, we are satisfied
    that their cumulative affect was sufficiently serious to warrant appellate
    intervention.  In these circumstances, it is unnecessary for us to consider
    the other arguments advanced by the appellant on the conviction appeal or
    to consider the sentence appeal.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we allow the appeal, set aside the convictions and finding of guilt and direct
    a new trial.</p>
