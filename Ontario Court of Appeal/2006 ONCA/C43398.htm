  <p class=MsoBodyText>On appeal from the judgment of Justice John R. McIsaac
    of the Superior Court of Justice dated March 17, 2005.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>GOUDGE J.A.: (dissenting in part)</span></h4>
  <h3><u><span lang=EN-US>INTRODUCTION</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      Kevin Keays was terminated by Honda Canada Inc. (Honda) on March
      29, 2000, after fourteen years of employment.  He had developed Chronic
      Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and had been directed by his employer to meet with
      its occupational medicine specialist, Dr. Brennan.  He declined to do so
      without clarification from Honda as to the purpose of the meeting, the
      methodology to be used, and the parameters of Dr. Brennan’s assessment.  Honda
      refused to provide him with such clarification, and terminated him for
      disobeying its direction.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      Keays sued for wrongful dismissal.  After a  twenty-nine day
      trial, McIsaac J. concluded that Keays had been terminated without just
      cause.  The trial judge fixed fifteen months as the period of reasonable
      notice and added a further nine months for the manner of Keays’ dismissal.  In
      addition, he ordered $500,000 in punitive damages because he found that
      Honda’s treatment of Keays constituted discrimination and harassment, was
      contrary to Ontario human rights legislation, and was both outrageous and
      high-handed.  Finally, he awarded Keays costs on a substantial indemnity
      basis, together with a premium.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      Honda appeals each of these findings and, as well, alleges bias
      on the part of the trial judge. While it is not presented for determination
      here, the approach required of employers to accommodate employee disabilities
      is the backdrop for many of the issues  raised in this appeal.  For the
      reasons that follow, I have concluded that, with one minor exception concerning
      the costs premium, I can find no error in the trial judge’s conclusions.  Nor
      was he biased.  I would therefore dismiss the appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;page-break-after:avoid;
'><b><u><span
lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></u></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
page-break-after:avoid'><span lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      The respondent started to work for the appellant in 1986, soon
      after it began operating a new assembly plant in Alliston, Ontario.  He
      began on the production line, but after twenty months joined the Quality
      Engineering Department.  He was selected to receive instruction in the
      appellant’s new global computer system with the expectation that he would
      train others in it. He was beyond doubt a dedicated and conscientious employee.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      Shortly after he commenced work, he began to experience health
      problems. His resulting absences from time to time caused problems for
      the lean staffing model used by the appellant.  Ultimately he went on disability
      leave in October 1996, and remained on leave until December 1998, when
      the appellant’s long term disability (LTD) insurer determined that he was
      able to return to work and terminated his benefits. The trial judge found
      that the respondent’s LTD benefits were wrongly terminated by the insurer
      following its evaluation of his ability to return to work.  The trial judge
      characterized that evaluation as a farce. In fact, during his absence on
      LTD, the respondent had been referred by his own doctor to the Director
      of the Sleep Disorders Clinic at the Toronto Hospital and, in March 1997,
      had been diagnosed with CFS, according to the criteria recognized by the
      Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      After his LTD benefits were terminated, the respondent returned
      to work, although under the protests of both himself and his treating physician
      that he was still too sick to do so. He soon began to experience intermittent
      work absences, that resulted in his being “coached” by way of a written
      report, the first step in the appellant’s progressive discipline process.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      In response to the respondent’s continued expressions of concern
      about the difficulty he was having in maintaining regular attendance because
      of his illness, the appellant advised him of its program to provide some
      accommodation for such a disability. In September 1999, the respondent’s
      doctor completed the necessary form for this program.  On the form, the
      doctor made it clear that the respondent suffered from CFS and would likely
      have to continue to miss about four days of work a month.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      Pursuant to its program, the appellant provided some accommodation
      for the respondent’s intermittent absences, thus recognizing, at least
      at this point, his CFS disability as a legal and medical excuse for those
      absences. However, the appellant also instituted a requirement at that
      time that the respondent had to get a doctor’s note validating each absence
      before he could return to work.  Employees with “mainstream” illnesses
      did not face this requirement.  Moreover, having to go to the trouble of
      obtaining these notes had the effect of lengthening each of the respondent’s
      absences. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      When the respondent was absent for six days in October 1999,
      he was asked to see Dr. Affoo, the company doctor.  It was not a positive
      encounter.  The respondent testified that the doctor threatened to move
      him back to the physically demanding production line, which he feared would
      enormously exacerbate his condition. When the respondent complained about
      this to his superiors, he was assured only that there was no intention
      to move him “at that time.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      January and February 2000, the respondent continued to request that his
      employer remove the “coaching” from his record and revisit the requirement
      that he provide a medical note for each absence.  However, he continued
      to be
    “stonewalled” (as the trial judge found) in connection with this requirement,
    the appellant’s acknowledgement of the validity of his disability, and his
    need for reasonable accommodation.  As a result, he retained counsel who
    wrote to the appellant on March 17, 2000, outlining these concerns in what
    the trial judge found to be extremely conciliatory terms, and offering to
    work toward a resolution of their differences. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant did not respond to this letter.  Instead, the appellant met with
      the respondent on March 21, 2000 and asked him to meet with Dr. Brennan,
      an occupational medicine specialist.  The appellant documented the matters
      discussed at this meeting in a letter to the respondent dated March 28,
      2000:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The following is a summary of the matters we discussed:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1. You were told that we have been reviewing your
    absenteeism as well as the doctor’s notes that you had been providing to
    cover those absences. We discussed your situation with Dr. Affoo [the company
    doctor] who is familiar with your case.  In addition, we had Dr. Brennan
    [the company’s occupational medicine specialist] review your complete medical
    file. Both doctors advised us that they could find no diagnosis indicating
    that you are disabled from working.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2. The doctor’s notes that you have been providing
    to cover your absences have provided limited information. The notes were
    merely repeating what you were telling the doctor.  There was no independent
    diagnosis or prognosis.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3. It was our intention to meet with you following
    the March break, to discuss our expectations.  Before we had a chance to
    do so, we received a letter from your lawyer dated March 17, 2000.  In that
    letter, your lawyer was asking that you no longer be required to bring notes
    to support your absences.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4. When we met on March 21, 2000, we advised you
    that we would no longer accept that you have a disability requiring you to
    be absent. Dr. Brennan and Dr. Affoo both believe that you should be attending
    work on a regular basis. In order for Dr. Brennan to get to know you and
    understand completely your condition, we advised that we would arrange for
    Dr. Brennan to meet with you. The plan was that Dr.&nbsp;Brennan would then
    communicate directly with your doctor to effectively manage your condition.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5. Before the meeting ended, you were agreeable
    to meeting with Dr. Brennan and I was to proceed to schedule the appointment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      day after the March 21 meeting, the respondent told his employer that on
      the advice of his lawyer he would not meet with Dr. Brennan until he was
      provided with clarification of the purpose, the methodology and the parameters
      of the assessment to be done by the doctor.  This resulted in the following
      direction to him in the appellant’s letter of March 28:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> Our position remains as we explained it to you
    on March 21, 2000.  Kevin, we do not accept the need for your recent absence
    nor, do we intend to elaborate further on the purpose of your meeting with
    Dr. Brennan. This was all explained to you carefully on March 21, 2000.  Our
    position remains the same.  We expect you to meet with Dr. Brennan and, we
  expect you to come to work.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      letter concluded with the warning that if the respondent did not meet with
      Dr. Brennan, he would be terminated.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>That
      is what happened.  The appellant was advised of his termination by a co-worker
      who phoned him at home to tell him that his dismissal had been announced
      to the department.  As a result of being fired, the respondent suffered
      a three or four month period of post-traumatic adjustment disorder.  He
      has been unable to work since his termination, and has since qualified
      for a total disability pension from the Canada Pension Plan.  That pension
      was continuing at the time of trial.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><u><span
lang=EN-US>THE TRIAL JUDGMENT</span></u></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge turned first to the issue of just cause.  He found that the
      appellant’s direction that Keays see Dr. Brennan was unreasonable in all
      the circumstances and, moreover, that it was not made in good faith, but
      rather, as a prelude to terminating the respondent to avoid having to accommodate
      his disability.  He also found that because of the difficulties the respondent
      had previously experienced with his employer over his absences, the respondent
      had good reason not to comply with the direction. Finally, he found that
      the appellant’s response was disproportionate and that the respondent’s
      refusal to see Dr. Brennan without further explanation was not a repudiation
      of his employment with the appellant. The trial judge therefore concluded
      that the appellant did not have just cause for terminating the respondent.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge applied the factors set out in <i>Bardal v. Globe &amp; Mail
      Ltd., </i>[1960] O.W.N. 253 (H.C.J.) to determine that the respondent was
      entitled to a reasonable notice period of fifteen months.  In addition,
      the trial judge found that the appellant displayed egregious bad faith
      in the manner in which it terminated the respondent, and as a result, the
      respondent suffered significant medical consequences.  The trial judge
      therefore extended the notice period by nine months to twenty-four months
      pursuant to <i>Wallace</i> <i>v. United Grain Growers Ltd.</i>,<i> </i> [1997]
      3 S.C.R. 701.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      trial judge went on to dismiss the following three additional claims for
      damages made by the respondent: (1) intentional infliction of mental distress;
      (2) the cause of action of discrimination and harassment; and (3) lost
      disability benefits.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>He
      then turned to the claim for punitive damages and found that the appellant’s
      course of conduct, culminating in the respondent’s dismissal, constituted
      discrimination and harassment in employment.  Further, this violation of
      the respondent’s human rights constituted an independent actionable wrong.  The
      trial judge catalogued a litany of examples of conduct warranting the description
      of outrageous and high-handed.  He concluded that a punitive damages award
      in the amount of $500,000 was necessary to bring this point home to the
      appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally,
      the trial judge considered the appellant’s motion, brought after final
      argument but before judgment, to have him step aside because of a reasonable
      apprehension of bias.  He dismissed the motion because he found that it
      was not sufficiently promptly brought.  He therefore found it unnecessary
      to address the particular allegations of bias.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Following
      the trial, the trial judge received submissions on costs and issued a supplementary
      decision in which he awarded costs to the respondent on a substantial indemnity
      basis. These included the costs of a first attempt to try this case in
      front of another judge.  That trial ended in a mistrial because of the
      illness of the judge. He based the award in large part on the appellant’s
      conduct.  He also added a premium of 25% because of the respondent’s tenuous
      economic circumstances, and the resulting risk undertaken by his counsel
      for fees and disbursements incurred. The trial judge then fixed the quantum
      of the respondent’s costs at $610,000 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.  </span></p>

      trial judge found that in determining how to address the respondent’s absences
      the first information gap that the appellant had to fill was whether the
      respondent’s doctors had ever made a proper diagnosis of CFS.  This would
      remove any doubts the appellant could reasonably have had about the legitimacy
      of the respondent’s disability. The trial judge determined that it was
      unreasonable to compel the respondent to meet with Dr. Brennan in order
      to get this information when all of his medical records were either already
      available to or obtainable by the appellant and would answer the question
      best.  Moreover, the ostensible basis upon which the respondent was ordered
      to see Dr. Brennan was that the doctor had already reviewed his file, which
      if completely accurate would have made the meeting unnecessary.</span></p>

      order the respondent to attend the meeting without clarifying its purpose.  Again,
      this finding is beyond challenge in this court.  Only a cursory explanation
      had been given to the respondent (contrasted with the much fuller explanation
      later offered at trial).  Given these facts, the trial judge could properly
      conclude that the respondent’s request for clarification was reasonably
      made.  Its peremptory denial would seem more consistent with the exercise
      of authority for its own sake than with an attempt to make the accommodation

      appellant’s letter of March 28, 2000 simply underlines the unreasonableness
      of the order to meet with Dr. Brennan.  It required the respondent to participate
      in a meeting ostensibly to find out more about his condition. Yet, as the
      trial judge found, the letter clearly implied that, contrary to its view
      in 1999, the appellant had now concluded that his condition was “bogus”.
      This prejudgment is inconsistent with the avowed purpose of the meeting,
      and incompatible with the proper functioning of the process for accommodating
      disability. </span></p>

      argument, the appellant sought to defend the mandatory meeting as necessary
      not just to find out about the respondent’s condition but to design an
      accommodation for the respondent’s disability.  Despite the assertion in
      the March 28 letter that he had done so, Dr. Brennan had in fact not reviewed
      the respondent’s entire medical record.  In addition, as the trial judge
      found, the letter made clear that the appellant had already apparently
      concluded, without fully reviewing those records, that the respondent’s
      alleged condition was not valid and that intermittent absence, the one
      accommodation suggested by his own doctors, was impermissible. </span></p>

      this context, the trial judge concluded that ordering the respondent to
      meet with a doctor who had expressed skepticism about his diagnosis to
      design the proper accommodation owed to him, was not reasonable. The factual
      findings underpinning this conclusion are grounded in the evidence, and
      there is no reason to interfere with his conclusion. It is important that
      the accommodation process display more open-mindedness and less prejudgment

      a reasonable excuse for not complying with the order. This finding, in
      essence the corollary of the unreasonable order finding, must also be accorded
      deference on appeal because of its factual dimension.  Moreover, I see
      no basis to quarrel with it, and for the same reasons. The appellant had
      just withdrawn the limited accommodation it had been providing for the
      respondent’s disability without acquiring any fresh medical information
      from him.  Despite the professed objective of the proposed meeting with
      Dr. Brennan, the March 28 letter clearly implied that the appellant had
      already determined that it did not accept that the respondent suffered
      from CFS and rejected intermittent absences as an accommodation.  Further,
      the respondent was denied the clarification he sought about the goals of
      the meeting. Given these facts, I can see no error in the trial judge’s
      conclusion that it was not unreasonable in those circumstances for the
      respondent to decline to attend such a meeting until further clarification

      that an employer’s response to employee misconduct must reflect the principle
      of proportionality.  Just cause for the most serious sanction, namely dismissal,
      requires the most serious misconduct. The Court describes this degree of
      employee misconduct in a number of different ways:  conduct that gives
      rise to a breakdown in the employment relationship; conduct that is fundamentally
      or directly inconsistent with the employee’s obligations; or conduct that
      violates an essential condition of the employment contract.  In a broad

      continued to want to contribute when medically able to do so.  His refusal

      to lengthen the notice period. He then applied the well-known factors in <i>Bardal</i>, <i>supra</i>,

      process.  He found that the March 28 letter misrepresented the views of
      both the company doctor and Dr. Brennan by clearly implying that both doctors
      thought he was not suffering from a disability but malingering, and by
      stating that both doctors believed he should be attending work on a regular
      basis. Neither had come to those conclusions.  The trial judge also found
      that the respondent was being set up for an adverse outcome by being asked
      to meet with Dr. Brennan. The trial judge concluded, on the basis of Dr.&nbsp;Brennan’s
      own evidence, that he generally practised the “hardball” approach to workplace
      absences associated with illness. In particular, Dr. Brennan was of the
      view that regular attendance at work was therapeutic for CFS patients.
      The order that the respondent meet with Dr. Brennan was the appellant’s
      attempt to subject the respondent to that hardball approach without fully
      explaining this to him.  The trial judge also factored in the appellant’s
      March 21 cancellation of the limited accommodation that the respondent
      had been receiving.  He found that this was a reprisal for the respondent
      having engaged counsel to advance his human rights, and therefore in contravention
      of provincial human rights legislation. </span></p>

      matters is that the appellant’s acts of discrimination and harassment triggered
      the respondent’s termination.  In fact, the trial judge found that the
      appellant’s course of discriminatory conduct culminated in the most dramatic
      form of employment harassment, namely the respondent’s termination.  This

      The appellant required the respondent to justify his medical absences because
      of his particular disability when employees with “mainstream” illnesses
      were not so required.  Due to absences caused by his disability, the appellant
      subjected him to the first step in the discipline process and then refused
      to remove the disciplinary “coaching” from his record. It required him
      to attend an interview with the company doctor where his disability was
      belittled and, as the trial judge found, he was treated with gross insensitivity.  What
      limited accommodation the company gave the respondent was cancelled in
      retaliation for his having retained a lawyer to advance the rights guaranteed
      to him by the <i>Human Rights Code</i>.  And the trial judge found that
      when the respondent refused to be “bullied” into seeing Dr. Brennan without
      an assurance that he would not be abused again, he was fired. These findings

      are all findings of fact which were available to the trial judge on this
      record.  None represents palpable and overriding error.  Indeed, in its
      factum, the appellant does not allege such an error. Rather, it advances
      other evidence to demonstrate that it acted  reasonably.  However, that
      evidence was all before the trial judge and it is not the role of this
      court to retry the case. On the findings made, the appellant went substantially
      beyond simply involving an occupational medicine specialist in the accommodation
      process.  It was open to the trial judge to characterize its conduct as
      outrageous and high-handed.</span></p>

      this conduct, an award of punitive damages was a rational response on the
      part of the trial judge. There is no doubt that it is permissible, indeed
      desirable for an employer to engage professional assistance in the accommodation
      process.  It is also entitled to require the employee to participate as
      well.  Where only accommodation to the point of hardship will suffice,
      the employer can decline to provide it. But it must engage in this process
      reasonably and in good faith.  Where it proceeds in bad faith and seeks
      to evade its legal obligation to accommodate those rendered vulnerable
      through disability by wrongfully terminating them, compensation and punishment
      are both justified.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      is what the trial judge found happened here. In essence, he found that
      the appellant refused to give genuine recognition to the respondent’s disability
      and seek, in an open minded, unbiased and good faith way, to meet with
      him to find a reasonable accommodation. Rather, the appellant deliberately
      contrived in bad faith to intimidate and then wrongfully terminate him
      to avoid its duty to accommodate a disability whose legitimacy it could
      not accept. Given his findings of fact, I find no reviewable error in these
      conclusions. They provide a rational basis for an award of punitive damages,
      as deterrence and denunciation of conduct causing significant harm to those
      who are disadvantaged and vulnerable due to disability.</span></p>

      should review the quantum awarded by asking whether the amount was rationally
      required in all the circumstances to punish the defendant’s misconduct.
      This is a more interventionist approach than that applied to awards of

      the quantum (which was $1 million in that case) is rationally proportionate
      to the objective of providing appropriate retribution, denunciation and
      deterrence. I need only refer to some of them.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First
      is the level of blameworthiness of the appellant’s conduct.  The trial
      judge found it to be planned and deliberate, and designed to escape its
      responsibilities to accommodate the respondent’s disability.  The appellant
      thereby violated something deeply personal to the respondent, his sense
      of dignity and self worth. The trial judge was entitled to view this as
      significant blameworthiness.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      degree of vulnerability of the respondent is also an important factor.
      Here the respondent was not only vulnerable as a long-term employee losing
      his job, important enough as Iacobucci J. outlined in <i>Wallace</i>. But
      to the knowledge of the appellant, his doctors had found that the respondent
      suffered from a serious medical condition, which added to his vulnerability.  Given
      this, the appellant’s abuse of its power was clear.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Another
      important factor is the harm to the respondent.  It too was significant.  He
      was rendered totally disabled and has remained so ever since.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Moreover,
      it was reasonable for the trial judge to see the need for deterrence as
      significant.  The need for this large employer, and indeed all employers,
      to take seriously their responsibilities in accommodating employees with
      disabilities is very important. This is, if anything, more true for employees
      whose disabilities may be seen by some as outside the mainstream and therefore
      not genuine. The accommodation process must be approached in good faith,
      openly, and sensitively if the dignity and equality of disabled employees
      is to be respected as required by the law and morality. Such an employer
      must be deterred from engaging in subterfuge to wrongfully terminate a
      disabled employee in order to escape these responsibilities.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Putting
      together the unique combination of circumstances here, particularly the
      blameworthiness of the appellant’s conduct, the respondent’s particular
      vulnerability, the harm to him and the need to deter this large employer
      from wrongfully terminating in order to evade its duty to accommodate,
      I cannot conclude that $500,000 in punitive damages, when added to the
      compensatory damages awarded to the respondent, exceeds what is rationally
      required to punish the appellant. As Binnie J. did in <i>Whiten</i>, I
      conclude that while I would not have awarded that sum, it is not so disproportionate
      as to exceed the bounds of rationality.</span></p>

      trial ended on April 19, 2004 when submissions were concluded. On June
      17, 2004, the appellant filed its bias motion which was heard by the trial
      judge on October&nbsp;26, 2004, while the judgment was still under reserve.  He
      dismissed the motion that day with reasons to follow. Those reasons were
      included with his trial reasons, released March 17, 2005.  He explained
      that he had dismissed the motion because the appellant had not brought
      it sufficiently promptly, and therefore, he found it unnecessary to address
      the merits of the allegations.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      appellant has tendered fresh evidence in this court to explain the timing
      of its motion, but also makes a number of submissions on the substance
      of its bias claim.  It is unnecessary for me to deal with the trial judge’s
      reasons for dismissing the motion because I think the interest of justice
      is best served by addressing the appellant’s bias claim on its merits.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant’s complaints fall into four categories.  First, it says that
      the trial judge conducted his own internet medical research and then improperly
      relied on that information to contradict Dr. Brennan’s expert evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This
      submission is completely without merit.  In para. 7 of his reasons for
      judgment, (reported at [2005] O.J. No. 1145 (Sup. Ct. J.)) the trial judge
      indicated that both counsel agreed that he could access the website of
      the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta Georgia to better understand
      CFS. Counsel for the appellant acknowledged this agreement and, when questioned,
      also acknowledged that neither counsel at trial placed any limitations
      on the use that the trial judge could make of the information thus acquired.  When
      the trial judge found that Dr. Brennan’s view that most patients with CFS
      improve significantly within three years was inconsistent with the CDC’s
      information that the actual percentage of patients who recover is unknown,
      he clearly did nothing improper.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
      the appellant submits that the trial judge added to the apprehension of
      bias “by refusing to deal with the merits” of the mistrial motion.  This
      is simply an inaccurate description of what the trial judge did.  He did
      not refuse to deal with the merits of the motion but found it unnecessary
      to do so.  This example of the exercise of a routine judicial practice
      does not in any way point to an apprehension of bias.  The appellant’s
      second submission is also without merit.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant’s third submission derives from comments made by the trial judge
      during closing submissions.  In several ways, he expressed his view that
      Dr. Brennan and the appellant were out of the same mould.  The appellant
      suggests that this indicates a predisposition to find a conspiracy among
      the appellant’s witnesses.  However, these comments were coupled with the
      trial judge making clear to counsel that this was his thinking at the moment
      and inviting submissions as to why he should not come to that conclusion.
      I do not see how a reasonable and informed observer would take those comments
      to indicate that the trial judge had already concluded that there was a
      conspiracy of any kind among the appellant’s employees, let alone the conspiracy
      he later described in his reasons for judgment.  Again, I find no merit
      in this submission.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Lastly,
      the appellant looks to the language in the trial reasons themselves to
      support its claim of bias. Most of the examples cited are in the context
      of the trial judge’s descriptions of the bad faith he found to characterize
      the dismissal, or the outrageous and high-handed conduct he found to warrant
      the punishment of punitive damages.  It is hardly surprising that such
      findings evoked strong language. Finally, it must be remembered that the
      words complained of appear in the reasons for judgment after the evidence
      and submissions were concluded and the decision reached. They reflect the
      decision maker’s judgment not his prejudgment.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There
      is no doubt that judges must always be sensitive to the words they use.  In
      my view, moderate rather than extreme language is probably the wiser course
      in most circumstances.  In this case, the trial judge used several colourful
      metaphors where more benign alternatives might have been better.  However,
      where as here, the evidence sustains findings of bad faith and outrageous
      and high-handed conduct some strong judicial language cannot be avoided.
      Nor can it be said to reflect a want of fairness or impartiality in coming
      to those conclusions.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This

  <h3>            iv)            Costs</h3>

      appellant also seeks to appeal the award of costs to the respondent on
      a substantial indemnity basis together with a premium of 25%.  The trial
      judge fixed an amount of $610,000 in total inclusive of disbursements and
      G.S.T., the amount sought by the respondent.  The appellant contests the
      scale, the inclusion of costs for the eight-day mistrial, and the premium.
      The appellant also submits that the trial judge failed to scrutinize the
      amount sought by the respondent.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      costs is a paradigmatic exercise of judicial discretion. In light of the
      appellant’s bad faith and outrageous conduct as found by the trial judge,
      I can find no error in his choice of the substantial indemnity scale.  This
      is not a duplication of the award of damages, but rather, it compensates
      the respondent for the legal costs he incurred.  Nor is the inclusion of
      the costs of the mistrial a reversible error. While the appellant did not
      cause the mistrial, the respondent incurred the costs of it and it is logical
      that he be compensated for it.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge awarded a premium because he found that the respondent’s limited
      income was totally inadequate to fund a twenty-nine day trial.  His counsel
      therefore took on the litigation at the risk of non-payment of significant
      fees and disbursements, yet achieved very significant success.  None of
      this can be contested.  On the basis of this court’s decision in <i>Walker
      v. Ritchie</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 1600, it was open to the trial judge to
      award a premium and I would not interfere with his decision to do so.  The
      risk undertaken and the reward achieved justify awarding a premium in this
      case.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However,
      the trial judge quantified the premium at 25%. While he did not expressly
      articulate it this way, the amount he fixed for the premium, namely $155,000,
      indicates that he based the amount entirely on the quantum of damages recovered
      by the respondent.  The premium represents 25% of that sum.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      my view, he erred in principle in doing so. The premium is justified not
      only by the result achieved, but also, by the risk undertaken by counsel
      of non-payment of significant fees and disbursements. See <i>Walker</i>, <i>supra </i>at
      para. 108. A consideration of both factors, not just one, is required in
      fixing the quantum of the premium.  Here, the fees and disbursements ultimately
      risked by the respondent’s counsel amounted to $393,000, considerably less
      than the recovery of almost $620,000. Keeping both in mind, and recognizing
      that fixing the quantum of the premium is an art not a science, I would
      set aside the award of $155,000 and reduce the premium to $77,500.</span></p>

      I can find no basis to conclude that the trial judge failed to sufficiently
      scrutinize the amount the respondent requested for the purpose of fixing
      costs.  He was provided by the respondent with a comprehensive bill of
      costs and complete dockets of time and disbursements.  He was intimately
      familiar with the way the trial had been conducted, the issues and what
      reasonable preparation was required for counsel to address them.  I would
      not interfere with the amount he fixed.</span></p>

      the result, save for the amount of the costs premium, the appeal is dismissed.
      The cross-appeal is also dismissed. Since the main appeal consumed virtually
      the entirety of the attention of the parties in this court, it is fair
      to say that the respondent has been almost completely successful.  He seeks
      costs on a partial indemnity basis in the amount of $40,000 all inclusive,
      which is significantly less than his partial indemnity bill of costs.  The
      appellant would have sought $65,000 on a partial indemnity basis had it
      been successful. In all the circumstances, including the nature, length
      and complexity of the appeal, a reasonable award of costs on a partial

      is no evidence to support this allegation of a broad-based conspiracy.  Dr.&nbsp;Brennan
      was an occupational medicine specialist.  The trial judge found that the
      request to have the respondent meet with Dr. Brennan was not made in good
      faith.  Be that as it may, the events have to be kept in context.  This
      request was communicated on March 21, 2000; events rapidly deteriorated
      and a week later the respondent’s employment was terminated.  The trial
      judge found that the respondent’s request to have Dr. Brennan’s role clarified
      was reasonable and the appellant’s refusal to do so unreasonable.  But,
      there is no evidence to support this conspiracy to interfere with the respondent’s
      relationship with his own physician.  In fact, the trial judge’s finding
      on this issue is inconsistent with his broad finding that the appellant
      intended to dismiss the respondent.  There would be no need to “insinuate” Dr.
      Brennan into the relationship if the company’s intent all along was to
      terminate the employment.</span></p>

      trial judge found that the appellant’s “outrageous conduct has persisted
      over a period of five years without a hint of modification of their position
      that Mr. Keays was the one in the wrong”.  This is a gross distortion of
      the circumstances and amounts to a palpable and overriding error.  The
      respondent was dismissed in March 2000.  From October 1996 to December
      1998, the respondent was on long-term disability.  After the termination
      of the benefits, the respondent returned to work.  There is no evidence
      that the appellant had anything to do with the insurer’s decision to terminate
      the benefits.  If there was any misconduct by the insurer (and the trial
      judge found there was), that misconduct cannot be laid at the feet of the
      appellant.</span></p>

      implemented the requirement of a physician’s note and in October of 1999
      with the attendance at Dr. Afoo that any serious misconduct begins.  Thus,
      this case concerns a period of seven months not five years.  It is difficult
      to determine where the reference to five years of outrageous conduct comes
      from except that the trial judge is simply counting the time from the respondent’s

      the fire until trial, the defendant engaged in continuous misconduct including

    was sceptical about the respondent’s disability and was taking steps to confirm
    its reality but there is no evidence that the respondent was viewed as a
    problem associate.  This characterization of the appellant’s conduct by the

      is a distortion of the circumstances.  I see nothing in this record to
      show that this appellant “ran amok”.  Certain employees in positions of
      responsibility, relying upon some expert advice, made decisions that were

      the Rules of Professional Conduct of the Law Society of Upper Canada when
      she participated in the ‘scrum’ to attempt to persuade Mr. Keay’s to abandon
      his request for clarification of Dr. Brennan’s mandate”.  Earlier in his
      reasons, the trial judge wrote that this conduct by counsel was “made in
      the face of a direct reference in counsel’s letter that Mr. Keays found
      it stressful dealing with these issues directly with Honda management and
      that future discussions were to be had with counsel, not Mr. Keays”.  He

      the appeal, counsel carefully reviewed the facts surrounding this incident
      and I think it important to put these events in their proper context.  Even
      on the respondent’s version, it is apparent that it was simply coincidence
      that the in-house counsel happened to be in a meeting with the respondent’s
      superiors on March 21 when the respondent asked to meet them.  It might
      have been prudent for counsel to have left the room.  However, I note that
      the letter to which the trial judge refers concerning contact with
    “counsel, not Mr. Keays” was not sent until a week later on March 28.  An
    earlier letter from the respondent's counsel to Honda on March 16 did not
    ask Honda not to deal with the respondent directly.  Finally, there was no
    evidence that Honda was aware at the March 21 meeting that counsel’s advice
    was that the respondent not meet with Dr.&nbsp;Brennan.  Honda did not receive
    notice of this decision until March 22.  If the fact that in-house counsel
    remained in the meeting was misconduct, a matter which I need not decide,
    it was technical misconduct and no basis for increasing the punitive damages.</span></p>

      case, is a contract case, I found it to be the most reasonable comparator.  Thus,

      award be proportionate to the blameworthiness of the defendant’s conduct,
      Binnie J. singled out for particular attention the duration of the misconduct.  He
      said the following:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The more reprehensible the conduct, the higher
    the rational limits to the potential award. <i>The need for denunciation
    is aggravated where, as in this case, the conduct is persisted in over a
    lengthy period of time (two years to trial) without any rational justification,
    and despite the defendant's awareness of the hardship it knew it was inflicting</i> (indeed,
    the respondent anticipated that the greater the hardship to the appellant,
    the lower the settlement she would ultimately be forced to accept).  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>

      I have explained, that is not our case.  The misconduct for which the appellant
      must take responsibility took place over a period of seven months and was
      simply not on the same scale as occurred in <i>Whiten.</i>  At para. 112,
      Binnie J. listed seven factors, including duration of the impugned conduct,
      that the court must consider in fixing the quantum of the award.  The trial
      judge made findings against the appellant on several of those factors,
      including: the misconduct was planned and deliberate and the appellant
      knew that the respondent was particularly vulnerable because of his disability.</span></p>

      whether the conduct towards the victim was malicious and high-handed.  Despite
      the gravity of some of the findings of misconduct the trial judge made
      against the appellant, the appellant’s conduct cannot fairly be described
      as malicious.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge placed special emphasis on the need for deterrence.  He said
      this:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It would appear to me that Honda ran amok as a
    result of their blinded insistence on production &quot;efficiency&quot; at
    the expense of their obligation to provide a long-time employee reasonable
    accommodation that included his own physician's participation.  It goes without
    saying that Honda is a worldwide corporation, a &quot;Leviathan&quot; compared
    to the
    &quot;minnow&quot; that Mr. Keays represents. As Binnie, J. stated in <i>Whiten,
    supra</i>, a &quot;large whack&quot;
    is required to &quot;wake up a wealthy and powerful defendant to its responsibilities&quot; (see
    para 118).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am also taking account the fact that this large
    corporation can easily afford to hire its own medical and legal advocates
    and insinuate them into established patient and client relationships without
    impunity as to professional and ethical concerns. Honda's in-house counsel
    breached the Rules of Professional Conduct of the Law Society of Upper Canada
    when she participated in the &quot;scrum&quot; to attempt to persuade Mr.
    Keay's to abandon his request for clarification of Dr. Brennan's mandate:
    see rule 4.03(2).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      have already commented on the allegation concerning the doctor-patient
      relationship and the alleged breach of the Rule of Professional Conduct
      by the in-house counsel.  I have also explained why findings such as the
      company “running amok” and a “broad-based conspiracy” are not supported
      by the evidence.  The need for deterrence thus seems to rest almost exclusively
      on the comparative positions of the appellant and the respondent.  In <i>Whiten</i>,
      at paras. 118-20, Binnie J. explained the care with which this factor must
      be approached.  Contrary to the comment by the trial judge, Binnie J. did
      not adopt the principle that “it takes a large whack to wake up a wealthy
      and powerful defendant to its responsibilities”.  To the contrary he described
      this as a theory and said at para. 118, that the relative size of the corporate
      defendant is “a factor of limited importance”.  Indiscriminate use of the
      relative power of the defendant and the plaintiff as a significant factor
      would lead to unprincipled awards.  Binnie J.’s approach in <i>Whiten</i> was
      much more nuanced and rigourous, as he explained at para. 119:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A defendant's financial power may become relevant
    (1) if the defendant chooses to argue financial hardship, or (2) it is <i>directly</i> relevant
    to the defendant's misconduct (e.g., financial power is what enabled the
    defendant Church of Scientology to sustain such an outrageous campaign for
    so long against the plaintiff in <i>Hill, supra</i>), or (3) other circumstances
    where it may <i>rationally</i> be concluded that a lesser award against a
    moneyed defendant would fail to achieve deterrence.  [Emphasis in original]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>None
      of those factors apply in this case.  In particular, there were no circumstances
      from which it could rationally be concluded that a lesser award would fail
      to achieve deterrence.  The trial judge’s finding to the contrary is directly
      inconsistent with his earlier finding that there was no pattern of abuse
      of other associates and the absence of any finding, contrary to the case
      in <i>Whiten</i> (see para. 120), that the misconduct by middle management
      was known at the time to top management who took no corrective action.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Another
      factor mentioned in <i>Whiten</i> as part of the proportionality analysis
      is the need to consider the totality of all other penalties including compensatory
      damages imposed on the defendant.  In this case, the trial judge had to
      bear in mind that he had already increased the damages for wrongful dismissal
      in accordance with <i>Wallace v. United Grain Growers Ltd.</i>, [1997]
      3 S.C.R. 701 for essentially the same conduct that attracted the punitive
      damage award.  The trial judge stated that he was taking into account “all
      the circumstances, including the compensatory awards already made”, but
      it is unclear on what basis he did so.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      final factor to be considered is the need for the punitive damage award
      to be proportional to the advantage wrongfully gained.  As the court held
      in <i>Whiten </i>at para. 124: “A traditional function of punitive damages
      is to ensure that the defendant does not treat compensatory damages merely
      as a licence to get its way irrespective of the legal or other rights of
      the plaintiff.”  Even accepting the trial judge’s finding that the appellant
      wanted to terminate the respondent because his prolonged absences were
      interfering with the smooth running of the operation, there is nothing
      on the record to show that the appellant saw the possibility of wrongful
      dismissal damages as nothing more than a licence fee.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      conclude by returning to the comparison of this case to <i>Whiten</i>.  Two
      factors stand out when comparing the two cases.  First, in <i>Whiten</i> there
      was a two-year period of escalating misconduct up to the trial.  Here the
      misconduct was for no more than seven months and is largely focused on
      the events of March.  I have already referred to the trial judge’s mischaracterization
      of a five-year period of outrageous conduct.  Although the trial judge
      identified one instance of late disclosure of a letter in the conduct of
      the trial, this does not extend the period of misconduct by Honda to the
      five years referred to by the trial judge. Second, in <i>Whiten</i>, the
      defendant persisted in its course of conduct, based on a theory that the
      plaintiff deliberately set the fire, in the face of repeated findings from
      its own experts and advisors that the fire was accidental.  Binnie J. described
      the defendant’s attitude to the plaintiffs at para. 4 as “harsh and unreasoning
      opposition” and an attempt to “exploit a family in crisis”.  That is not
      the case here.  The appellant had advice, albeit wrong and based on incomplete
      information, that caused it to question the respondent’s disability and
      it had, for almost a year, accommodated his absences.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      come then to the difficult problem of assessing the quantum of punitive
      damages bearing in mind the overarching principle that the award must be “that
      amount, <i>and no less</i>, [that is] rationally required to punish the
      defendant’s misconduct” (<i>Whiten </i>at para. 96, emphasis in original).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Bearing
      in mind the trial judge’s findings that can be supported by the evidence,
      and in particular the findings that the conduct by the appellant was planned
      and deliberate and designed to intimidate and ultimately terminate the
      employment of a particularly vulnerable employee and that the appellant
      was aware of its continuing duty to accommodate, an award in excess of
      those awarded in other wrongful dismissal cases is appropriate.  But, given
      the compensatory damages awarded, especially the <i>Wallace</i> damages,
      and that there were no special factors requiring deterrence such as a pattern
      of abuse or the kind of conduct found in <i>Whiten</i>, as well as the
      relatively short duration of the misconduct, in my view, an award of no
      more than $100,000 can be justified.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      would reduce the punitive damage award accordingly.  In all other respects,
      I agree with my colleague’s disposition of the appeal and cross-appeal.</span></p>
