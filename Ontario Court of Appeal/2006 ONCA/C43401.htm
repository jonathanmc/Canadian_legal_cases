    Philogene appeals his convictions for robbery and aggravated assault.  He
    argues that the trial judge erred in ruling that his videotaped confession
    was admissible.  The Crown acknowledges that if the appellant’s statements
    are not admissible in evidence, his conviction cannot stand.  The appellant
    also appealed his sentence, but that appeal was abandoned.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the evening of February 20, 2004, Carol Ann Taylor (“Taylor”) was walking
    underneath an overpass near the Scarborough LRT station at Lawrence Avenue.  A
    man approached her from behind, put his arm around her neck, and demanded
    her purse.  Taylor refused to relinquish it.  In the ensuing struggle, the
    individual stabbed Taylor multiple times, severely injuring her.  Taylor
    did not get a good look at her assailant, but she was able to identify him
    as a male wearing a darker colour winter jacket.  Two witnesses to the attack
    said that the attacker had dark skin.  The witnesses did not identify the
    weapon used to stab Taylor as a knife, but one thought it looked like a metal
    tube.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was subsequently located by a police tracking dog, arrested, and
    placed in the back of a police car.  P.C. Darnley (one of the arresting officers)
    explained to the appellant his right to counsel.  The appellant stated that
    he understood his rights, and that he wanted to call a lawyer when he got
    to the police station.  At the station, P.C.&nbsp;Darnley told the officer-in-charge
    (Sergeant Johnston) that the appellant wished to call a lawyer at the earliest
    convenience.  Sergeant Johnston told the appellant that he could use the
    telephone to contact a lawyer, and asked him if he understood.  The appellant
    replied in the affirmative.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was placed in an interview room at 9:00&nbsp;p.m. and was interviewed
    by Detective Constable Imrie from 9:20 to 9:30&nbsp;p.m.  The appellant testified
    during the <i>voir dire</i> that Imrie spent the next 10 minutes feeding
    the appellant the version of events that he wanted the appellant to give
    in the videotaped interview that followed.  Imrie testified that he was there
    to gather information for the Record of Arrest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    next person to interview the appellant was Detective Long, who according
    to the accused was accompanied by two other officers.  According to the accused
    they all engaged in intimidation.  Long testified that he identified himself,
    asked the appellant if he understood his right to counsel, and received an
    affirmative response from the appellant.  Long also testified that he did
    not know that P.C. Darnley had told Sergeant Johnston that the appellant
    wanted to contact counsel at the earliest convenience, and Long did not ask
    the appellant whether he wanted to telephone counsel.  The appellant testified
    that Long did not ask him if he understood his right to counsel, that Long
    did not have a note pad with him while he was in the room, and that Long
    did not take any notes.  He also alleged that Long had made intimidating
    statements to him (along the lines of “I wish I had been there when you were
    arrested.”).  Long admitted at trial that he was not assigned to do the Record
    of Arrest and that he went off-shift shortly after his brief interview with
    the appellant.  The interview lasted less than five minutes and was not videotaped.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    10:05&nbsp;p.m., Imrie gave the appellant a sandwich and a carton of milk.  At
    10:35&nbsp;p.m., he went back to speak with the appellant.  Imrie asked him
    whether he had been read his rights to counsel and his caution, and the appellant
    replied that he had and that he understood.  Imrie asked him if he wanted
    to speak with a lawyer, and the appellant answered “no.”  No one had told
    Imrie that the appellant had indicated that he wished to call counsel at
    the station, nor did Imrie believe that any opportunity had been provided
    to the appellant to call counsel while he was waiting in the interview room.  Imrie
    proceeded to talk to the appellant about the incident in a non-videotaped
    interview.  During this interview, the appellant stated that the weapon was
    not a knife but a bottle.  The interview lasted fifteen minutes.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    next interview, which lasted from 11:16 to 11:39&nbsp;p.m., was videotaped.  At
    the outset of the videotaped interview, Imrie informed the appellant of his
    right to counsel and asked him if he wanted to speak to a lawyer.  The appellant
    said no.  In the course of the interview, the appellant confessed to the
    offence.  However, he testified on the <i>voir dire</i> that he had not been
    telling the truth.  He said that he was so scared that he would have said
    anything to get out of the room, and that he had not given the interview
    of his own free will.  Imrie denied allegations that he told the appellant
    that he could go home if he confessed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge ruled that both the videotaped statement and a transcript of
    it were admissible evidence.  He held that the appellant had been informed
    of his right to counsel a number of times, and that on the videotape the
    appellant did not display any sign of fear.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his charge the jury, the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There is some circumstantial evidence and that
    is that the accused, dressed in black, essentially, was found in the general
    area.  Now had there been nothing more, I probably would have instructed
    you to return verdicts of not guilty.  But there is more in the form of a
    videotaped confession.  The circumstantial evidence, while not enough on
    its own, may be considered by you as evidence supporting a confession.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    an eleven-day jury trial, the appellant was found guilty of robbery, aggravated
    assault, and assault with a weapon.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Issues</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Admissibility of Fresh Evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the outset of this appeal, the appellant sought to introduce fresh evidence.  The
    fresh evidence consists of guilty pleas of another person, Woodley, to other
    robberies.  The Crown opposes the admissibility of the fresh evidence.  In
    our opinion, the proposed evidence does not meet the criteria for the admissibility
    of fresh evidence and is of no assistance.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>Issue #1         The trial judge’s ruling on the voluntariness of
      the appellant’s statement</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in holding that the appellant’s
    statements were voluntary.  He submits that the trial judge failed to appreciate
    that just because a statement was ultimately taped, there was still a real
    issue as to its voluntariness. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    agree.  In order to properly determine voluntariness, the trial judge was
    obliged to consider what preceded the taped statements.  He ought to have
    found the untaped portion of the interviews suspect and gone on to do an
    analysis of whether there was a sufficient record of the untaped portion
    to be able to rule on the voluntariness of the taped portion.  See this court’s
    decisions in <i>R. v. Moore-MacFarlane</i> (2001), 160 C.C.C. (3d) 493 (C.A.);<i> R.
    v. Sabri</i> (2002), 166 C.C.C. (3d) 179 (C.A.); <i>R. v. Ahmed</i> (2002),
    170 C.C.C. (3d) 27 (C.A.).  The appellant was in custody; video equipment
    was available and the police deliberately set out to interrogate him without
    taping.  The resulting interrogation was thus rendered suspect by the fact
    that it was not recorded.  The trial judge failed to take these factors into
    account as part of his reasoning on the question of the voluntariness of
    the taped statement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    circumstances prior to the taped interview are rendered even more suspect
    by the fact that at trial Const. Imrie admitted to making his notes after
    the interrogation; that his notes were selective, not exhaustive; and that
    they contained inaccuracies.  On the <i>voir-dire</i>, Const.&nbsp;Imrie
    testified that it was impossible for him to stay on top of the conversation
    and make notes and that was why the notes were only a summary of portions
    of the conversation.  At trial, Imrie admitted that his notes of the unrecorded
    10:35&nbsp;p.m. interrogation were after-the-fact summaries.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his reasons for rejecting the appellant’s evidence of intimidation and/or
    inducements to confess, the trial judge did not subject Imrie’s reasons for
    not videotaping the pre-statement interrogations to the same level of scrutiny
    that he applied to the appellant’s testimony.  The appellant alleged that
    both fear of prejudice and hope of advantage had been held out to him by
    different police officers.  The trial judge made only passing reference to
    officer Long’s denial of threats.  He did not deal with the issue of inducement.  In
    not doing so the trial judge further erred. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    errors in the trial judge’s ruling would entitle the appellant to a new trial.  However,
    the appellant raises a further issue as to whether his rights to counsel
    were violated and we now propose to deal with that issue.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>Issue #2         The trial judge’s ruling as to whether the appellant’s
      s.&nbsp;10(b) rights were violated</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    also agree with the appellant’s submission that his s.&nbsp;10(b) rights
    were violated. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    the appellant told the arresting officer that he wished to speak to a lawyer
    when he arrived at the station, and this wish was communicated to the booking
    sergeant by the arresting officer, the appellant was not provided with access
    to a telephone in the hour and thirty-five minutes that he was detained in
    an interview room before he was interviewed by Constable Imrie. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    duty to facilitate contact with counsel requires the police to offer to use
    of the telephone.  See <i>Bartle v. The Queen</i> (1994), 92 C.C.C. (3d)
    289 (S.C.C.)<i>.  </i>The fact that the breach of the appellant’s right to
    counsel involved the implementational aspect of the right as opposed to the
    informational aspect still resulted in the infringement of the appellant’s
    s.&nbsp;10(b) rights.  This is not a situation of the appellant failing to
    be diligent in the exercise of his right to counsel; he was never given the
    opportunity to be diligent in exercising that right prior to the breach of
    his right to counsel. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> We
    do not propose to enter into speculation as to whether the appellant would
    have given his statements had there been compliance with the implementational
    component of his rights.  The accused was treated unfairly while he was in
    custody and the admission of his videotaped statement would bring the administration
    of justice into disrepute.  His statements should have been excluded pursuant
    to s.&nbsp;24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is therefore allowed, the conviction set aside and an acquittal is
    entered. </p>
