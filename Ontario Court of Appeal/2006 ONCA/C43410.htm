  <p><b>On appeal from the conviction entered on November 15, 2004 and the sentence
      imposed on March 11, 2005 by Justice </b><b>Dougald R. McDermid of the
      Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury.</b></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>BY THE COURT:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    a trial before McDermid&nbsp;J. sitting with a jury, the appellant was convicted
    of sexual assault.  He was sentenced to three years imprisonment.  He appeals
    against both the conviction and the sentence.  The principal evidence in
    the case was that of the eleven year old complainant, S.R., who testified
    at trial.  In addition, pursuant to s.&nbsp;715.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    a videotape of an interview of S.R. conducted by a children’s aid worker
    and a police officer was entered as an exhibit and admitted for the truth
    of its contents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    core of the complainant’s evidence was that during the early part of 2003,
    when the complainant was nine years old, the appellant, whom she described
    as her “step&#8209;dad”, committed against her a series of acts of sexual
    misconduct, including intercourse.  The Crown also called evidence by the
    police officer and children’s aid worker who interviewed the complainant
    and by a family friend to whom the complainant told her story about the alleged
    sexual activity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant did not testify, nor did the defence call any other evidence at
    the trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant advances two arguments on the conviction appeal: (1) the jury’s
    verdict was unreasonable; and (2) the trial judge erred in his treatment
    of the jury’s request that part of the video of the complainant’s interview
    be played back.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>Unreasonable verdict</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There
      is a heavy burden on an appellant who seeks to establish that a verdict,
      including a jury verdict, was unreasonable: see </span><i><span lang=EN-US>R.
      v. Biniaris</span></i><span
lang=EN-US> (2000), 143 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) and </span><i><span lang=EN-US>R.
      v. Francois</span></i><span lang=EN-US> (1994), 31 C.R. (4th) 201 (S.C.C.).  The
      test in a jury case is “whether the verdict is one that a properly instructed
      jury, acting judicially, could have rendered”: </span><i><span lang=EN-US>R.
      v. Yebes</span></i><span lang=EN-US>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168 at 185.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      this appeal, there is no issue concerning the “properly instructed jury”
    component of the test; the appellant does not attack any portion of the trial
    judge’s jury charge, which he describes as “exemplary”.  The only issue is
    whether the jury’s verdict was unreasonable in spite of the trial judge’s
    excellent charge.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      principal evidence at trial was that of the young complainant.  The appellant
      points to clear inconsistencies between what she said in the interview,
      where she gave a full description of a substantial amount of sexual activity
      with the appellant, and her testimony at the preliminary inquiry and the
      trial, especially in cross&#8209;examination, where she could not remember
      some events and denied that others had taken place (e.g. anal sex).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant also relies on what the trial judge said about the complainant’s
      evidence in his jury charge.  He said that the complainant’s evidence “is
      not only inconsistent but quite contradictory about the very subject matter
      of these charges.”  He continued:</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Also, I suggest that there are very real risks
    in accepting her testimony about her allegations against [the appellant]
    unless you find some evidence independent from her testimony in court and
    what she said on the videotape that support what she said.  It is for you
    to decide, but I recall no such independent evidence to support her allegations.  Therefore,
    in my opinion – it is your opinion that counts – but in my opinion, it would
    be dangerous for you to find [the appellant] guilty on this evidence.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>However, I emphasize that you should reject
    my opinion if you do not agree with it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    there is some force in these submissions, we do not think that they support
    a conclusion that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable.  At a minimum, the
    core of the complainant’s evidence was that the appellant engaged in vaginal
    intercourse with her at a friend’s home on a number of occasions.  This was
    a consistent thread of her evidence in the interview, at the preliminary
    inquiry and at trial.  Moreover, the jury was in the favoured position of
    seeing both the video interview of the complainant and her testimony at trial.  Accordingly,
    it was well&#8209;placed to assess her credibility.  In the end, the trial
    judge was right to tell the jury that it was its opinion that ultimately
    mattered: see <i>Francois</i>, <i>supra</i>, at pp.&nbsp;214&#8209;15.  In
    this case, the jury believed the core of the young complainant’s evidence,
    namely that her step&#8209;father had engaged in sexual activity with her.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>Jury Question</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant contends that the trial judge erred in his response to the jury’s
      question: “We would like to see the video from the beginning of [the children’s
      aid worker’s] questioning.”  The trial judge ordered that precisely this
      portion of the video be played for the jury in the courtroom.  The appellant
      submits that this response was insufficient, that there was also an obligation
      to have read back to the jury the testimony of the complainant that might
      be regarded as contradictory of what she said in the video interview.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
      disagree.  The trial judge exercised his discretion by not sending the
      videotape (which was an exhibit) into the jury room during the jury’s deliberations.  Throughout
      the trial – when he admitted the video into evidence, when he gave a mid&#8209;trial
      instruction to the jury, and with respect to his proposed jury charge – the
      trial judge took care to invite submissions from counsel about the proper
      use of the video in the jury’s deliberations.  Both counsel agreed with
      the steps he took.  Moreover, after the jury asked to see part of the video,
      defence counsel at trial made no objection until after the video had been
      played, and the objection was general and unfocussed.  Specifically, defence
      counsel at trial did not request a readback of the complainant’s testimony,
      including the cross&#8209;examination.  For these reasons, we conclude
      that the trial judge handled the jury’s request to see part of the video
      in an appropriate fashion.  It is true that he could have gone further,
      and that an ideal response might have included a reminder that the jury
      should be alive to the other evidence from the complainant, including the
      cross&#8209;examination.  However, defence counsel did not request this,
      and we cannot say that its omission undermines the trial judge’s response.</span></p>
