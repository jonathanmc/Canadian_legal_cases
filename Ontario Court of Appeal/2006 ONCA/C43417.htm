    Assistance in Criminal Matters Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, C. 30 (4<sup>th</sup> Supp.)<i>.</i>  The nature of the fraud
    was established primarily through documents and business records, statements

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE ACT</span></h4>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Section 6</b>: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Subject to a relevant
    extradition agreement, extradition may be granted under this Act whether the
    conduct or conviction in respect of which the extradition is requested occurred
    before or after this Act or the relevant extradition agreement or specific
    agreement came into force.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b> Section
    29(1):</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A judge shall order the committal of the person
    into custody to await surrender if:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a) in the case of a person sought for
    prosecution, there is evidence admissible under this Act of conduct that, had
    it occurred in Canada, would justify committal for trial in Canada on the
    offence set out in the authority to proceed and the judge is satisfied that the
    person is the person sought by the extradition partner; and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b) in the case of a
    person sought for the imposition or enforcement of a sentence, the judge is
    satisfied that the conviction was in respect of conduct that corresponds to the
    offence set out in the authority to proceed and that the person is the person
    who was convicted.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Section 29(4):</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4) The date of the authority to proceed is the
    relevant date for the purposes of subsection (1).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Section 32(1) </b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Subject to subsection (2), evidence that would
    otherwise be admissible under Canadian law shall be admitted as evidence at an
    extradition hearing. The following shall also be admitted as evidence, even if
    it would not otherwise be admissible under Canadian law:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a) the contents of the documents contained in
    the record of the case certified under subsection 33(3);</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b) the contents of the documents that are
    submitted in conformity with the terms of an extradition agreement; and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(c) evidence adduced by the person sought for
    extradition that is relevant to the tests set out in subsection 29(1) if the
    judge considers it reliable.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Section 32(2)</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Evidence gathered in Canada must satisfy the rules
    of evidence under Canadian law in order to be admitted. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Section 33(1) </b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The record of the case
    must include:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a) in the case of a person sought for the
    purpose of prosecution, a document summarizing the evidence available to the
    extradition partner for use in the prosecution; and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b) in the case of a person sought for the
    imposition or enforcement of a sentence,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>     (i) a copy of the document that records the
    conviction of the person, and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>     (ii) a document describing the conduct for which the person was

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Issue 1.  Section 29(4) </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In his factum, the appellant argues
    that the Authority to Proceed was invalid because the alleged conduct said to
    have taken place in the USA predated the 2002 amendments to the <i>Canadian
    Criminal Code</i> corresponding to the appellant’s conduct.  He argues that double criminality under the
    Act should be assessed as of the date the alleged criminal conduct took
    place.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In oral argument, the appellant’s
    counsel argued instead that s. 29(4), which became law in 1999, was only
    intended to apply to conduct that took place after the enactment of the
    statute. He contended that s. 29(4) is a substantive, not a procedural
    provision, and that citizens are entitled to notice that their conduct may be
    extraditable. Both arguments fail.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section 29 of the Act is clear and
    unambiguous.  Under s. 29(1)(a), the
    extradition judge determines whether there is admissible evidence of conduct
    that, had it occurred in Canada, would justify committal for trial in Canada on
    the offence or offences set out in the Authority to Proceed.    Subsection (4) provides that the date of
    the Authority to Proceed is the relevant date for the purpose of subsection
    (1).  Unlike the former Act, the
    assessment of double criminality is therefore made at the date of the Authority
    to Proceed, not the date when the alleged conduct occurred, even if that
    conduct pre-dated the enactment of the new <i>Extradition Act</i>.  In the present case the appellant’s alleged
    conduct was criminal at the time the Authority to Proceed was issued.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This interpretation of s. 29(4) had
    been adopted by other courts: see <i>Ebke v. Federal Republic of Germany et al.</i> (2003), 173 C.C.C. (3d) 261 (N.W.T.C.A.); <i>Canada (Ministre de la Justice) c.
    Désilets</i>, [2005] J.Q. No. 1515 (C.A.); <i>The United States of America v.
    Reda</i>, [2004] Q.J. No. 9554 (Sup. Ct.); and <i>United States of America v.
    Quintin</i>, [2000] O.J. No. 791 (Sup. Ct.)/\.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>If there can be any doubt about this
    interpretation, it is quickly dispelled by the wording of s. 6 which clearly
    provides that extradition may be granted whether the conduct occurred before or
    after the Act came into force.  The Act,
    including s. 29, was clearly intended to apply to conduct that pre-dated the
    coming into force of the new statute.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It must be remembered that the Act is
    concerned with extradition from Canada and not prosecution in Canada.  The appellant’s surrender to the USA under
    the Act cannot be said to operate retroactively.  The Act was in force when the request was received and his
    surrender ordered.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In any event, from a practical point
    of view, the appellant was liable for extradition under the former Act.  Fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud and money
    laundering were all offences under Canadian law at the time the appellant is
    alleged to have committed the offences in the USA.  The appellant would have been liable to be extradited under the
    former Act.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We would not give effect to this
    ground of appeal.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Issue 2. The <i>Charter</i> argument</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In his factum, the appellant submits
    that sections 6 and 7 of the <i>Charter</i> do not permit the retroactive
    application of s. 29(4) to the period prior to the passage of the Act. This
    argument was not pursued during oral argument.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>No notice of constitutional question
    was filed in the court below.  Since the
    issue was not properly raised and considered in the court below, it should not,
    generally speaking, be entertained for the first time on appeal.  Constitutional challenges should not be
    determined in an evidentiary vacuum, particularly when legislative facts are
    required to properly consider the issue:  see, for example, <i>R. v. Sweeney</i> (2000), 148 C.C.C. (3d) 247 (Ont.
    C.A.). </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>No reason has been advanced as to why,
    in this case, the appellant should be permitted to raise this issue for the
    first time on appeal.  In any event, we
    see no merit in this argument on the basis of the written submissions.  Section 29(4) of the Act does not violate
    any provision of the <i>Charter</i>.  It
    does not contravene the <i>Charter</i> to extradite a person to a foreign state
    for a criminal trial, when the alleged conduct is an offence under Canadian law
    at the time the extradition request is received.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Issue 3. The summary of
    evidence from records gathered in Canada </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The USA relied, in part, on a summary
    of records that had been gathered in Canada.  In our view, the summary of this evidence was admissible, as mandated in
    s. 33 (1):  see <i>United States of
    America v. McDowell</i> (2004), 183 C.C.C. (3d) 149 (Ont. C.A.). The
    extradition judge noted that there is no basis to believe that any of the
    evidence relied on had been obtained unlawfully or improperly.  He was correct in concluding that the
    summary of the evidence relating to the business records was properly
    admissible under s. 32 of the Act as long as it complied substantively with
    Canadian law.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As stated in <i>Re McVey</i>, [1992] 3
    S.C.R. 475 at para. 106, “the fine or nice distinctions of criminal law are out

    the Minister’s decision </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In his factum, the appellant also
    attacks the Minister’s surrender decision and contends that the Minister erred
    in the following ways:  </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) he stated that the appellant could resist the
    admission of any evidence wrongfully obtained against him in Canada at his
    criminal trial in the USA; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) he found that the USA had not resiled from the
    evidence summarized in the Record of the Case; and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c) the attempt to extradite the appellant is the
    continuation of a pattern of abusive behaviour and it would be oppressive and
    unjust to surrender him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In oral argument, counsel argued only
    the alleged errors in (a) and (c).  We
    found no merit in these arguments and did not require the Minister to respond.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At the outset, it must be remembered
    that the Minister’s decision to order surrender attracts a high standard of
    judicial review:  see <i>Canada v.
    Schmidt</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 500. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With respect to the first argument, it
    must be presumed that the appellant will receive a fair trial in the foreign
    state. There is also a finding by the extradition judge that there is no basis
    to believe that any of the evidence summarized and relied upon by the USA was
    gathered improperly in Canada.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As to the second argument, the
    appellant relies on a previous investigation by the USA (the Powelson
    investigation) that involved the appellant and that was eventually
    abandoned.  After the USA abandoned the
    investigation, the appellant brought an application for various types of relief
    based on the impropriety of Canadian and American authorities.  The application judge ruled against the
    appellant.  In our view, on the record
    before us, the previous investigation bears no connection to the present
    case.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Minister’s decision to surrender
    the appellant is reasonable and ought not to be disturbed.  The appellant has failed to establish that
    it would be oppressive or unjust to surrender him to the USA.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, the appeal and the
    application for judicial review are both dismissed. </span></p>
