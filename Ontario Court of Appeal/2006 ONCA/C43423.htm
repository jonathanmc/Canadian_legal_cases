    Lewi, the appellant, and Deborah Lewi, the respondent, were married on December
    25, 1983.  They separated in October 1996.  They have two children, Darren
    and Brandon.  At the time of this appeal, Darren was 20 years of age and
    Brandon was 18 years old.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    separation, there was protracted litigation with respect to financial matters
    and child support in particular.  After a trial in April 2002, the parties
    settled the matrimonial matters that divided them.  That settlement gave
    rise to a consent order dated April 10, 2002 (“the Order”).  The Order required
    Mr. Lewi to pay the following amounts of monthly support to Ms. Lewi:  child
    support in the table amount of $2,073 based on the appellant’s annual income
    of $180,000<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a>;
    special expenses of $200 for computer and computer-related expenses for both
    children and car insurance for Darren; and, spousal support of $3,700 for
    the first year and $3,500 thereafter.  Although the Order was silent in respect
    of post-secondary education expenses, Mr. Lewi contributed $1,500 to Darren’s
    post&#8209;secondary education costs for each of the 2003/2004 and 2004/2005
    school years.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Darren
    was born on February 9, 1985.  He began university in the fall of 2003 and
    is currently in his third year of post-secondary studies at the University
    of Toronto, Scarborough campus.  His claimed expenses for tuition, fees,
    books and parking were approximately $6,100 per academic year.  For the 2003/2004
    school year, he received a scholarship of $500.  He continues to live at
    home with his mother in Thornhill, Ontario.  By all accounts, Darren is a
    healthy, bright young man and an excellent student.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Brandon
    was born on April 15, 1987.  Brandon was in high school when the motion was
    brought but it was expected that he would attend the University of Western
    Ontario starting in the fall of 2005 with the goal of proceeding to the Ivey
    School of Business at Western.  By the time of the appeal, he had begun his
    post-secondary studies as planned and was living in residence.  Brandon is
    also an excellent student.  His costs, including residence, were anticipated
    to be between $15,000 and $17,000 per year while at the University of Western
    Ontario but will rise to $30,000 per year if he is accepted into the Ivey
    School of Business.  While the record is not perfectly clear on this point,
    it appears that Brandon hopes to take the third and fourth years of his undergraduate
    degree at the Ivey School of Business. </p>

'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant is a senior executive with IBM.  According to his sworn financial
    statement, he earns in excess of $181,000 per year.  He has remarried and
    his spouse earns $80,000 per year.  He estimates the value of his unencumbered
    home to be $600,000.  </p>

    respondent is unemployed and has been since 1999 when she was constructively
    dismissed from her position at IBM, a job that she had held for twelve years.  The
    children have lived with her since the time the parties separated.  She deposes
    that she has no income apart from the spousal support she receives from the
    appellant and that significant health problems have inhibited her capacity
    to return to work.  She also deposes that, since separation, she has had
    to sell the matrimonial home and then downsize again to a more modest house,
    she has used her equity to meet her and the children’s needs, and she has
    incurred substantial debt.    </p>

'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    March 2004, Ms. Lewi brought a motion to vary the Order.  She sought an increased
    contribution from Mr. Lewi for expenses pursuant to s. 7 of the <i>Federal
    Child Support Guidelines</i>, S.O.R./1997-175 (the “Guidelines”), including
    post-secondary education expenses for undergraduate and graduate programs
    of study.  She asked for an order that the children’s university expenses
    be shared by the parties in proportion to their respective incomes. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Lewi resisted the motion on the grounds that both children have substantial
    funds of their own and those funds should be used to pay for post-secondary
    education expenses before any parental contribution is ordered, particularly
    as the children have no relationship with him.  Although he defended the
    motion to vary, he did not file any pleading instituting a claim for relief
    nor did he seek any relief.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the marriage, the parties established a savings plan for each child.  Gifts
    of money to the children were placed into Canada Savings Bonds in the children’s
    names.  Their paternal grandfather gave the children a total of $110,000
    over an eleven-year span, beginning with Darren’s birth.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    separation, the respondent cashed in the children’s Canada Savings Bonds
    for approximately $134,000, or $67,000 per child.  For each child, approximately
    $54,000 was transferred into a mutual fund and $10,000 into a money market
    fund.  Approximately $8,000 was deposited into an RESP in Darren and Brandon’s
    joint names.  The mutual fund investments subsequently lost money due to
    market conditions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no dispute that the funds belong to the children. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Lewi used the funds in the money market accounts to purchase a car for Darren
    at a cost of $20,000.  The car enables Darren to get to and from university
    in Scarborough while living at home in Thornhill.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    December 12, 2003, Darren had the car and investments valued at $41,821.07.  Brandon
    had investments worth $41,822.28.  The RESP in the children’s joint names
    was valued at $7,140.35.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice
    Eberhard heard the motion.  Based on Mr. Lewi’s annual income of $182,000,
    in addition to Mr. Lewi’s continuing obligation to pay spousal support of
    $3,500 per month, she ordered Mr. Lewi to pay the table amount of child support
    of $2,094 per month if both children lived at home while pursuing post-secondary
    education.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    there is some question as to what the motion judge intended to order in the
    event that Brandon lives away from home while attending university, para.
    7 of the order under appeal provides that in such circumstances, child support
    is reduced to the table amount for one child plus one-third of the difference
    between the table amount for one child and the table amount for two children.  In
    light of the calculations given by the motion judge in her reasons for decision,
    I conclude that the motion judge intended the appellant to pay table support
    for one child throughout the year and table support for the two children
    during the four summer months when both are living at home with the respondent.  Four
    out of twelve months is one-third of a year.  In order to set child support
    payable on a monthly basis, the motion judge ordered that such child support
    was to be the table amount for one child plus one-third of the difference
    between the table amount for one child and the table amount for two children.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge determined that each child should contribute to his university
    education, from summer employment earnings or his funds, the following amounts:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'>(a)       Before first year:      The greater of actual earnings minus $2,000
    or $1,000.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'>(b)       Before second year:  The greater of actual earnings minus $2,000
    or $2,000.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'>(c)       Before third year:      The greater of actual earnings minus $2,000
    or $3,000.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'>(d)       Before fourth year:   The greater of actual earnings minus $2,000
    or $4,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge ordered the parties to pay the balance of undergraduate post-secondary
    expenses in proportion to their incomes with the result that Mr. Lewi is
    to pay 77% of such expenses and Ms. Lewi is to pay 23%.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    order specifically leaves open the matter of post-graduate expenses and entitlement.  It
    also specifies that if the annual costs of attending a post-secondary program
    of education and living away from home fall outside the range of $15,000
    to $17,000, such a change “would constitute an unforeseen circumstance that
    could trigger a reconsideration”.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Lewi appeals.  He asks this court to reduce the amount of child support that
    he is to pay and to order that the children use their own funds for their
    post-secondary education.  Ms.&nbsp;Lewi cross-appeals, seeking an order
    for unreduced child support and increased support for s.&nbsp;7 expenses.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal in part and dismiss the
    cross-appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US>THE DECISION BELOW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    determining that the gifts to the children from their paternal grandfather
    had not been specified to be solely for their education, the motion judge
    considered the question of parental contribution to the children’s post-secondary
    education expenses under s. 7 of the Guidelines.  She noted that there was
    little evidence before her of the ability of the boys to contribute to their
    undergraduate post-secondary education costs from their own earnings and
    stated that “some contribution”
    from their own effort should be required.  She found that requiring the parents
    to contribute to the boys’
    post-secondary education expenses would not result in hardship to the parents
    and that the family would have made the necessary sacrifices to contribute
    to their sons’ post-secondary education expense had the family remained intact.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge then set out a formula for each child’s contributions to his
    university education which, generally speaking, amounted to a minimum of
    $1,000 for the first year, $2,000 for the second year, $3,000 for the third
    year and $4,000 for the fourth year.  The money could come from summer employment
    or their funds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge stated that the decision to attend university away from home
    was “within the range of normal for students who can afford the choice”.  She
    held that, in light of the family’s spending pattern prior to separation
    and family income, such a decision was not unreasonable.  After setting out
    the education expenses that were to be funded, the motion judge observed
    that it would result in some personal sacrifice for the parents but that
    such a burden is common to all parents with children who continue on to post-secondary
    education.        </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    both children remained at home during their post&#8209;secondary studies,
    the parties were to share, as post-secondary education expenses, the cost
    of tuition, books, supplies, commuting costs (including parking) and any
    other school-related fees.  If one child attended university away from home,
    in addition to those expenses, the cost of residence or other accommodation,
    meal plan and/or food costs and other living expenses were to be included.  Government
    contributions to the RESP and interest earned by the RESP<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a>; scholarships, grants and bursaries;
    and the imputed contribution of the child were to be deducted from such expenses
    and the remaining cost was to be shared by the parents with Mr. Lewi paying
    77% and Ms. Lewi paying 23%.</p>

    respect to periodic child support, the motion judge ordered continued full
    Guideline table support if both boys were to live at home during their post-secondary
    studies of $2,094 per month, based on Mr. Lewi’s annual income of $182,000.  However,
    if a child lived away from home while attending university, table support
    was ordered for only that period in which the child lived with the respondent,
    that is, during the four month “summer” vacation.  Child support, in such
    an event, was to be paid on a monthly basis but the amount was calculated
    as the table amount for one child, plus one third of the difference between
    table support for one child and two children.  </p>

    terms of other s. 7 expenses, the motion judge continued computer and car
    insurance expenses because “they facilitate the ongoing education needs”.  However,
    the motion judge noted that some of the computer costs related to one-time
    purchases that would not be repeated and that “the choice of car ownership
    as the means of transportation includes in it a component that goes beyond
    necessity”.  She therefore fixed the appellant’s contribution for ongoing
    computer and car insurance expenses at $300 per month.  The motion judge
    held that Brandon’s sports costs were appropriate while he was in high school
    and “nicely replace the costs of camp” in the Order.  She found that they
    were no longer reasonable and necessary once “the expensive priority of post-secondary
    education expenses appears”.  She ordered the appellant to pay 77% of the
    hockey costs for Brandon’s final two years at high school, fixed at $1,000
    per year.</p>

    reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>15.1(1) A court of competent jurisdiction may,

    15.1(1) makes it clear that the obligation to pay child support depends upon
    a child being a “child of the marriage”.  The definition of “child of the
    marriage” in s. 2(1) of the Act reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='page-break-after:avoid;'>2. (1) In this
    Act,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>  “child of the marriage” means a child of two

  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b) is the age of majority or over and under

    of that ordered pursuant to ss. 3 and 7 of the Guidelines.  The amount that
    a payor is ordered to pay for special or extraordinary expenses pursuant
    to s. 7 is to be
    “added on” to the child support order made pursuant to s. 3, as s. 7 expenses
    are not covered by the child support order.  See <i>Andrews v. Andrews </i>(1999),

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote1>3.
    (1)&nbsp; Unless otherwise provided under
    these Guidelines, the amount of a child support order for children under the
    age of majority is,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote1>(a) the amount set out in the applicable table,

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Unless

    support order relates is the age of majority or over, the amount of the child
    support order is</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote1>(a) the amount determined by applying these
    Guidelines as if the child were under the age of majority; or</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote1>(b) if the court considers that approach to be
    inappropriate, the amount that it considers appropriate, having regard to the
    condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the child and the financial
    ability of each spouse to contribute to the support of the child.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote1>7. (1) In a child support order the court may, on
    either spouse's request, provide for an amount to cover all or any portion of
    the following expenses, which expenses may be estimated, taking into account
    the necessity of the expense in relation to the child's best interests and the
    reasonableness of the expense in relation to the means of the spouses and those
    of the child and to the family's spending pattern prior to the separation:</p>

    appellant argues that parents are required to contribute to their children’s
    post-secondary education expenses only after the children have first used
    their own funds to pay for such expenses.  As support for this proposition,
    he points to the guiding principle in s. 7(2) that an expense under s. 7
    is to be shared by the parents in proportion to their respective incomes <i>after</i> deducting
    the children’s contributions.  Consequently, the appellant says, the motion
    judge erred in requiring him to contribute to the children’s post-secondary
    education expenses and other s. 7 expenses before their own funds had been
    exhausted.  Furthermore, he says that requiring the children to contribute
    only between $1,000 and $4,000 per year to their education costs is unreasonable,
    in light of the amount of funds available to them.  In his written material,
    he requests an order that the children pay university expenses out of their
    own funds, that he contribute $1,500 per year to each child for each year
    of their first post-secondary degrees and that the parties share equally
    all additional s. 7 expenses.  In his oral submissions (and in his written
    calculations showing various cost scenarios), I understand him to request
    an order that the children bear all s. 7 expenses.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent argues that the children ought not to be required to use any of
    their savings for their post-secondary education.  She contends that parents
    bear the primary obligation to pay for adult children’s post-secondary education
    expenses and that the motion judge erred in assuming that children have an
    obligation to draw on their own savings to reduce parental contribution.  She
    points out that the motion judge found the money to have been gifts to the
    children and that, as gifts, the money belongs to the children and they are
    free to deal with it as they choose.  She says that the money was put aside
    for the children “to give them a start in life”.    In her cross-appeal,
    she seeks an order requiring the appellant to contribute to the children’s
    post-secondary education expenses in proportion to his income, without contribution
    by the children.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    making this argument, the respondent relies on a combination of the wording
    of s. 7(1) of the Guidelines and the findings of the motion judge.  Section
    7(1) requires the court, when making an order for s. 7 expenses, to take
    into account “the family’s spending pattern prior to the separation”.  The
    motion judge found that the parties would have made the necessary sacrifices
    to contribute to their sons’ post&#8209;secondary education expenses had
    the family remained intact and that it would be contrary to the family’s
    spending pattern prior to separation to now require the boys to draw upon
    their savings to fund their post-secondary education.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent also argues that the motion judge erred in treating accommodation
    and meal costs as post-secondary education expenses, saying that such costs
    should be covered by child support paid pursuant to s. 3.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    begin by considering the appellant’s contention that the motion judge was
    obliged to require the children to exhaust their funds before requiring parental
    support.  In my view, the wording of s. 7 does not support such an interpretation.  Had
    the legislature intended such a requirement, there would be language to that
    effect.  There is none.  Rather, s. 7(1) directs the court to take a balancing
    approach - to set the amount of parental support taking into account “the
    reasonableness of the expense in relation to the means of the spouses and
    those of the child and to the family’s spending pattern prior to separation”.  As
    Blishen J. said at para. 53 of <i>McMahon v. Hodgson </i>(2002), 25 R.F.L.
    (5th) 102 (Ont. Sup.Ct.), “in considering the post-secondary education expenses,
    it is necessary to consider the means, needs and circumstances of both the
    spouses and the children”.  I would add that s. 7(1) requires such a consideration
    to be undertaken within the context of the family’s spending pattern prior
    to separation.       </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    s. 7(2) states, as a “guiding principle”, that parents are to share post-secondary
    expenses “after deducting from the expense, the contribution, <b><i>if any, </i></b>of
    the child” [emphasis added].  On a plain reading, the words “if any” are
    an express contemplation that a child may be required to contribute nothing
    toward such expenses.  Every child will have access to some type of financial
    resources, whether savings, earnings from part-time or summer employment
    or loans.  If a child need not make any contribution toward his or her post-secondary
    education expenses, there can be no implied requirement that a child must
    fully exhaust his or her financial resources before the court can order parental
    support.  Having said this, I do not wish to be taken as suggesting that
    the intent is that the child make no contribution.  On the contrary, it appears
    to me that the intent is that the child is to make a contribution;  however,
    the words “if any” are an express contemplation that, in appropriate circumstances,
    the child may contribute nothing.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the other hand, I do not accept the respondent’s submission that it is an
    error to require the children to use some of their savings as a contribution
    towards their post-secondary education expenses.  Section 7(1) directs the
    court to set the amount of child support for s. 7 expenses after taking into
    account the “means”
    of the child.  “Means” must include a full consideration of the funds available
    to the child for his or her post-secondary education, including savings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    short, I accept neither of the extreme positions advanced by the parties,
    namely, that an adult child of the marriage with savings is required to contribute
    all of those savings towards his or her post-secondary education before the
    parents are called on to contribute or that such a child need contribute
    none of his or her savings.  As a general rule, an adult child should be
    required to make a reasonable and meaningful contribution towards post-secondary
    education expenses.  The amount of that contribution will depend on all of
    the circumstances but must include a consideration of the “means” of the
    parents and the children.  In such a consideration, it is appropriate to
    consider income and savings of both the parents and the child.  In fairness,
    when a child has savings that are being looked to for the purpose of determining
    the amount of his or her contribution, the savings and comparable assets
    of each of the parents ought also to be considered.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    the extent that <i>Rosenberg v. Rosenberg </i>(2003), 42 R.F.L. (5th) 440
    (Ont. Sup.Ct.) can be read as support for the proposition that an adult child
    of the marriage must contribute as much as possible to his or her support
    and expenses before parents are required to provide child support, I disagree.  Section
    3(2)(a) of the Guidelines provides that, presumptively, child support for
    an adult child of the marriage is to be the amount determined as if the child
    were under the age of majority.  That presumption includes both child support
    for living expenses (i.e. Table support) and child support for special or
    extraordinary expenses pursuant to s. 7.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    note that the motion judge in <i>Rosenberg v. Rosenberg </i>relies on <i>Fraser
    v. Jones </i>(1995), 17 R.F.L. (4th) 218 (Sask. Q.B.) and <i>Bradley v. Zaba </i>(1996),
    137 Sask. R. 295 (C.A.).  In my view, neither case supports the proposition
    that an adult child of the marriage is obliged to contribute as much as possible
    to his or her own support and expenses.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Bradley
      v. Zaba </i>addresses the question of when an adult child in university
      remains a child of the marriage.  The ability of a child to contribute
      to his or her support is discussed at para. 10 of the reasons for decision.  There,
      the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal says that in deciding whether an adult
      child remains a child of the marriage, a court may wish to consider such
      factors as “the ability of the child to contribute to his or her own support
      through part-time employment”.  That does not amount to holding that the
      child has an obligation to contribute as much as possible to his or her
      support or expenses.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Fraser
      v. Jones</i>, at para. 11, the application judge states that the finding
      that an adult child in attendance at a post-secondary institution is a
      child of the marriage which</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…
    does not relieve the child of all responsibility.  She has an obligation,
    insofar as possible and reasonable, to take action to at least contribute
    towards her needs.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with that statement.  An adult child of the marriage has the obligation
    to reasonably contribute to his or her post-secondary education expenses.  However,
    that obligation does not rise to the level of requiring the child to pay
    for all of his or her post-secondary education expenses where the parents
    have the ability to contribute to those expenses.  The parental obligation
    to pay child support, including child support under s. 7 of the Guidelines,
    arises from s. 15.1(1) of the Act and continues so long as the child remains
    a “child of the marriage”.  Quantification of that obligation is done pursuant
    to the Guidelines; the Guidelines cannot obviate the parental support obligation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    consider next the respondent’s contention that the motion judge erred in
    treating living expenses for children living away from home while attending
    a post-secondary institution as s. 7(1)(e) expenses.  In my view, the motion
    judge made no error in her treatment of the post-secondary education expenses.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    so concluding, it is important to bear in mind that the recipient of funds
    under s.&nbsp;3 is different than the ultimate recipient of funds under s.&nbsp;7.  Table
    support paid to a recipient parent pursuant to s.&nbsp;3 is partial compensation
    for the cost of the child residing with them.  A child support payment for
    s.&nbsp;7 expenses, on the other hand, is not intended to be a payment into
    the recipient parent’s hands for his or her own use.  It is not a contribution
    to costs borne by the parent with whom the child is residing.  Rather, it
    is a contribution toward the cost of specified expenses.  If such monies
    flow through the recipient parent, he or she is to act as a conduit and ensure
    that the money is used for the specified s.&nbsp;7 expense.  Consequently,
    s. 7 child support is specified separately from child support for living
    expenses (typically, table support) in child support orders.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    view that table support is based on the assumption that the child is residing
    in the same household as the recipient parent and that living costs are properly
    treated as post-secondary education expenses when the child lives away from
    home to attend a post-secondary institution, was articulated by Heeney J.
    in <i>Merritt v. Merritt</i>, [1999] O.J. No. 1732 (Sup.Ct.) at para. 73:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where, however, a child is residing in another
    residence for the bulk of the year, it seems inappropriate to apply tables
    that are not designed with that living arrangement in mind. Furthermore,
    the table approach assumes that the recipient parent discharges her obligation
    by being physically in the same household and providing the family home and
    other amenities for the child.  Where a child is at college, this assumption
    does not hold true.  It therefore seems more appropriate to calculate the
    actual costs of providing for the needs of the child in his other residence,
    factoring in a contribution toward the cost of maintaining the family home
    to return to on weekends and school breaks, where appropriate, and apportion
    that between the spouses on a <i>Paras </i>approach after considering the
    child’s own ability to contribute.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    for Darren, as a child attending a post-secondary education program and living
    at home, the motion judge properly treated the costs of tuition, books, supplies,
    commuting (including parking) and other school-related fees as his post&#8209;secondary
    education requires.  For Brandon, as a child attending a post-secondary education
    program and living away from home, in addition to those costs, there are
    the added expenses of residence or other accommodation, meal plans and/or
    food costs, and living expenses.  </p>

'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It

    my view, the appellant is mistaken in his view that Darren is required to
    contribute between only $1,000 and $4,000 per year towards his post-secondary
    education.  I say this for two reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the formula for contribution fashioned by the motion judge makes it clear
    that for each year of Darren’s undergraduate program, he is to contribute
    all of his summer earnings, less $2,000, towards the cost of his education.  Thus,
    depending upon the amount he earns in the summers, Darren may contribute
    more than the specified minimum amounts of $1,000 before first year, $2,000
    before second year, $3,000 before third year and $4,000 before fourth year.  Those
    specified minimum contributions, however, ensure that Darren will contribute
    to his post-secondary education expenses even if he does not have summer

    second reason relates to Darren’s purchase of a car, at a cost of $20,000,
    from his savings<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[3]</span></a>.  Darren’s
    purchase of a car enabled him to live at home while attending university.  The
    cost of living at home to attend university is significantly less than the
    cost of living away while attending university.  A review of Darren and Brandon’s
    respective expenses make this clear:  Darren’s annual post-secondary costs
    are estimated at $6,100 whereas Brandon’s annual costs are estimated at between
    $15,000 and $17,000, unless he goes to the Ivey School of Business for his
    last two years of his undergraduate degree, at which point his expenses are
    anticipated to be approximately $30,000 per year.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence on the record is that Darren would have considered going away to
    university but for the fact that the cost was
    “prohibitive”, in light of the respondent’s circumstances.  Darren’s decision
    to live at home and commute by car resulted in a much-reduced level of post-secondary
    expenses.  Viewed in this way, Darren has already contributed $20,000 of
    his savings towards the cost of his post-secondary education.  Ignoring the
    cost of interest on the $20,000 capital outlay and the residual value of
    the car at the end of Darren’s first post-secondary degree, on this view,
    over the course of the four years of the program, Darren will have contributed
    $5,000 annually in addition to the contribution contemplated by the motion
    judge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    note, also, that even ignoring the purchase of the car, in his senior years,
    Darren will contribute a significant portion of his post-secondary expenses.  In
    his fourth year, for example, he must contribute at least $4,000 towards
    anticipated expenses of $6,100.         </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    establishing Darren’s level of contribution, the motion judge considered
    his post-secondary education expenses<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[4]</span></a> in
    relation to the means of the parties and the family’s spending pattern prior
    to separation.  To the extent that the motion judge failed to take into consideration
    the funds held for Darren, in my view, she erred.  However, for the reasons
    given, I would not alter the motion judge’s determination of Darren’s contribution
    to his post-secondary education expenses.  </p>

    previously stated, s. 7(1) requires the court to consider, among other things,
    the child’s “means”.  In my view, the word “means” encompasses all of the
    child’s financial resources.  In this case, that would include the funds
    held for Brandon (“Brandon’s savings”).  Although the motion judge refers
    to Brandon’s savings when deciding whether they were impressed with a trust,
    it does not appear that she considered Brandon’s savings when setting the
    amount he was to contribute to his post-secondary education expenses.  By
    way of contrast, she expressly discusses the children’s obligation to contribute
    based on summer employment.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span

    when determining the amount of his contribution to post-secondary education

    Brandon’s contribution to his post&#8209;secondary education expenses.</p>

    that his annual post-secondary education expenses remain in the range of
    $15,000 to $17,000, in addition to the contribution determined by the motion
    judge, in my view it would be appropriate for Brandon to contribute $20,000
    to such expenses, payable at the rate of $5,000 per year.  My reasons for
    so concluding follow.   </p>

    appellant does not take issue with the necessity of post-secondary education
    expenses.  Thus, pursuant to s. 7(1), the task of the court is to determine
    the amount of support to be ordered based on a consideration of three things:
    (1) the reasonableness of the expense in relation to (2) the means of the
    parents and the child and (3) the family’s spending pattern prior to separation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    away from home.<a href="#_ftn6"

    that, I understand the motion judge to have found that Brandon’s post-secondary
    education expenses, based on attendance at an institution while living away
    from home, were reasonable when considered within the context of the parents’ means
    and the family’s spending pattern prior to separation.   </p>

    relation to the parties’ means, at para. 17 of the reasons, the motion judge
    found that imposing a contribution on the appellant would not
    “result in hardship to an impoverished parent” and, at para. 32, she acknowledges
    that all of the parties’ contributions will come from the appellant’s income,
    partly through spousal support to the respondent.  She also found that had
    the family remained intact, it would have made the necessary sacrifices to
    contribute to the children’s post-secondary education<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    considering Brandon’s means, I note three things.  First, although not expressly
    stated, the motion judge found the expenditure of $20,000 of Darren’s savings
    in furtherance of his university education to be an appropriate contribution
    by Darren to his post-secondary education expenses.  Second, the family spending
    pattern prior to separation (and, indeed, afterwards) in relation to the
    children’s savings was to ensure that the children maintained the same amount
    of savings.  Third, Brandon’s savings were the same as Darren’s, prior to
    Darren’s purchase of a car. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    recognise that it can be argued that Brandon ought to contribute more given
    that his post-secondary education expenses are significantly greater than
    are those of Darren.  In my view, if Brandon contributes $20,000 from his
    savings, he will have contributed more than Darren because Darren will have
    a car at the end of his undergraduate education as a result of his contribution,
    whereas Brandon will have no such tangible asset as a result of his contribution.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, the real question is what contribution ought to be required of
    Brandon in light of his means and those of his parents, and the family’s
    pattern of spending prior to separation.  Given that it was appropriate for
    Darren to use $20,000 of his savings in furtherance of his post-secondary
    education, that Darren and Brandon are similarly situated in terms of family
    means and background, and the family pattern of keeping Darren and Brandon’s
    savings at the same level, a contribution of $20,000 from Brandon’s savings,
    in addition to the contribution determined by the motion judge, appears fair
    and appropriate.  It also means that Brandon will make a reasonable and meaningful
    contribution to the overall cost of his first undergraduate degree.  For
    example, if Brandon’s expenses remain at between $15,000 and $17,000, in
    his fourth year, Brandon will contribute at least $9,000<a
href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[9]</span></a>,
    an amount that exceeds 50% of the total expenses for that year.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Such
    a contribution is consistent with objectives (a) and (d)
    of the Guidelines.&nbsp; These are set out in
    s. 1 and read as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote1 style1>1. The objectives of these Guidelines are,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote1 style1 style='page-break-after:avoid;'>(a) to establish a fair standard of support for
    children that ensures that they continue to benefit from the financial means of
    both spouses after separation; &hellip;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote1 style1>(d) to ensure consistent treatment of spouses and
    children who are in similar circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    level of contribution is consonant with objective (a) in that it requires
    Brandon to make a substantial contribution but also allows him to benefit
    from the appellant’s financial means, which are considerable.  It is consonant
    with objective (d) as both children will be treated consistently in respect
    of the amount of their contributions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    setting the amount of Brandon’s contribution, I have been influenced also
    by his educational plan.  As mentioned earlier, while the record is not entirely
    clear, it appears that Brandon hopes to take his third and fourth years of
    university at the Ivey School of Business.  Brandon is an exceptional young
    man and there is every reason to believe that he will be accepted into the
    Ivey business program as he hopes.  If that comes to pass, his post-secondary
    expenses will rise to $30,000 per year.  In accordance with para. 8 of the
    order under appeal, such a change could trigger a reconsideration of s. 7(1)(e)
    expenses.  In such an event, it is likely that Brandon will be required to
    make a greater contribution to the costs of his education.  If Brandon contributes
    $5,000 per year from his savings for each of the first two years of his undergraduate
    education, in addition to the amount he is to contribute from summer employment,
    he will have sufficient remaining savings to take his third and fourth years
    at the Ivey School of Business even if ordered to make a substantially greater
    contribution for those years of undergrad education.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Put
    another way, in light of the parties’ means and the family’s historic approach
    to spending on education, I have set Brandon’s contribution at a level that
    will not so seriously deplete his savings as to put at risk his ability to
    pursue his educational dreams.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US>            <i>Response to
        the children’s contributions as determined by Juriansz J.A.</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have had the benefit of reading the reasons of Juriansz J.A. who is of the
    view that Darren should pay for the entirety of his university education
    expenses and that Brandon should pay, in addition to the contributions determined
    by the motion judge, one-half of his post-secondary education expenses.  With
    respect, I disagree that those amounts are warranted for four reasons.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;'>1.            In light of the motion
    judge’s findings of fact, the amounts are contrary to the legislative intent
    as expressed in s. 7.  Section 7 states that the amount of child support
    for the stated expense is to reflect, among other things, the spending pattern
    of the parents in respect of the child during cohabitation.  The motion judge
    made an unchallenged finding of fact that had the family remained intact,
    they would have made the necessary sacrifices to contribute to their sons
    post-secondary education expenses.  Therefore, as the parents have the capacity
    to contribute financially, the parents should make some contribution to those
    expenses.  Indeed, both parties are prepared to do so.  Mr. Lewi’s position
    throughout is that he has paid $1,500 each year towards the cost of Darren’s
    post-secondary education expenses and is prepared to continue paying that
    sum.<a
href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[10]</span></a>   Requiring
    Darren to pay all such expenses is to require his parents to contribute nothing
    directly towards such expenses, this despite their willingness to contribute
    and despite the motion judge’s finding that the spending pattern of the parents,
    prior to separation, was such that they would have contributed to such expenses
    had the family remained intact.          </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;'>2.            In my view, those
    amounts are inconsistent with the evidentiary record.  One of the reasons
    given for requiring the children to make such contributions is that Ms. Lewi
    has far less discretionary income that she had prior to separation.  I see
    no evidence to that effect on the record.  Even assuming that to be the case,
    however, Ms. Lewi’s express position is that she is prepared to pay a proportionate
    amount of the boys’ post-secondary education expenses.  As she is willing
    to use her income in that fashion, I would not presume otherwise.  Similarly,
    I see nothing in the record to support the statement that Mr. Lewi’s financial
    ability to contribute to such expenses has been affected.  In fact, the contrary
    appears to be the case in that his financial position, as far as it is disclosed
    on this record, is extremely good.  His financial statement indicates that
    he owns an unencumbered home worth $600,000, that his income exceeds his
    expenses each month and that he has substantial savings and other assets.  He
    earns in excess of $180,000 per year and lives with his new spouse who earns
    a substantial income and who pays for a third of the household expenses.  He
    pays for their annual vacations.  He has no other dependents.  </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;'>3.            Those amounts are
    unfair to the children in two ways.  First, the children are being required
    to use their capital (i.e. savings) when the record indicates that the parents
    could make the necessary contributions from income and neither party has
    maintained that they would be forced to use savings to pay such amounts.  Second,
    they are unfair from a procedural perspective.  The children were not parties
    to the proceeding; they have never been heard on this matter and yet their
    rights are being seriously impacted.  It may seem that the same criticism
    could be levelled against the contribution that I would have them make but
    there is a fundamental difference.  The children have already explicitly
    agreed to use $20,000 of savings in furtherance of Darren’s post-secondary
    education by virtue of having bought a car for him to use to get to and from
    university.  There is no reason to think they would not be prepared to use
    an equivalent amount in furtherance of Brandon’s post-secondary education.  In
    that sense, there is implicit consent to that amount of contribution by Brandon.   </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;'>4.            In the circumstances,
    the amounts create a disincentive for children to save gifts of money. </p>

    expenses as s. 7 expenses.  He maintains that there was no evidence that
    the expenses are reasonable or necessary.  He also contends that computer
    and travel expenses are not extraordinary expenses and are covered by the
    payment of periodic child support. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge held that computer and car insurance remain appropriate s.&nbsp;7
    expenses “because they facilitate the [children’s] ongoing education needs”.  I
    see no basis on which to interfere with the exercise of her discretion in
    that regard.  I do not think it can be seriously contended that she erred
    in exercising her discretion to include such expenses as post-secondary expenses.  Given
    the distances involved, it is not unreasonable for Darren to have a car in
    order to attend university in Scarborough while living in Thornhill and both
    children, as university students, require computers for their education.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
    the parties treated computer and car expenses as expenses separate and apart
    from those covered by periodic child support.  It will be recalled that the
    Order that governed child support for a number of years was based on a settlement
    that the parties had reached.  Among other things, the Order provided that
    in addition to periodic child support, Mr. Lewi would pay “section 7 expenses
    of $200 per month” for computer expenses for both children and car insurance
    for Darren.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    the extent that the appellant argues that only post-secondary expenses found
    to be “extraordinary” can qualify as s. 7 expenses, I disagree.  Section
    7(1)(e) refers to “expenses for post-secondary education”.  In categories
    (d) and (f) of s. 7, the expenses are explicitly qualified by the word “extraordinary”.  Had
    the legislature intended that only extraordinary post-secondary education
    expenses were to be considered for the purposes of s. 7(1)(e), it would have
    said so.  See <i>McLaughlin v. McLaughlin </i>(1998), 167 D.L.R. (4<span style='font-family:&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>th</span>) 39 (B.C.C.A.) at para. 82 to the same
    effect.  I do not read <i>Park v. Thompson, supra</i>, as suggesting anything
    to the contrary.  The expenses in question in <i>Park v. Thompson </i>included
    a trip to England, a ski trip to Whistler, clothing for the ski trip, and
    a cell phone.  They did not relate to post-secondary education expenses under
    s. 7(1)(e).  Read in context, it is clear that this court’s determination
    of whether the expenses in <i>Park v. Thompson </i>were extraordinary arose
    because the expenses were considered as potentially falling within ss. 7(1)(d)
    and (f).  As noted above, ss. 7(1)(d) and (f) explicitly require the expenses
    to be “extraordinary”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relation to hockey expenses, I note that the Order required Mr. Lewi to share
    the cost of Brandon’s attendance at summer camp as a specified extracurricular
    expense.  The Order makes no reference to Brandon’s hockey expenses because
    at the time the Order was made, the respondent accepted sole responsibility
    for such expenses given their modest cost.  Through the motion, the respondent
    sought a contribution from Mr. Lewi for Brandon’s hockey expense because
    that expense had increased from a few hundred dollars a year to approximately
    $1,700 per year, excluding the cost of equipment.  The appellant filed no
    evidence in response to this claim.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s financial contribution for extraordinary extracurricular activities
    under the Order has been reduced because Brandon no longer attends camp.  The
    motion judge noted that the costs of camp were “nicely replaced” by the cost
    of Brandon’s sports activities and ordered the appellant to pay his proportionate
    share of those expenses while Brandon was in high school but not beyond.  Although
    not explicitly stated, in my view, the motion judge was exercising her discretion
    to treat sports expenses as falling within s. 7(1)(f) “extraordinary expenses
    for extracurricular activities”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    see no error in the motion judge’s treatment of hockey as an extracurricular
    activity or in her implicit determination that the expenses in question are
    extraordinary.  While modest expenses arising from a child’s participation
    in extracurricular activities are to be covered by basic child support, it
    was within the motion judge’s discretion to find that Brandon’s hockey expenses
    had risen beyond the ordinary expenses associated with a child’s participation
    in a sport.  </p>

    turn next to the appellant’s submission that the motion judge’s determinations
    in respect of s. 7 expenses ought to be set aside because there was no evidence
    before her that the expenses were reasonable or necessary.  The motion judge
    was clearly alive to the requirement in s. 7 that an expense is to be estimated
    taking into account its necessity and reasonableness; she makes explicit
    reference to those considerations in her reasons.  </p>

    light of the amounts on which the parties had previously agreed for the purpose
    of sharing of expenses.  She was clearly aware of the financial positions
    of both parties and the children.  She refused to order additional support
    for sports expenses when Brandon reached university as “once the expensive
    priority of post-secondary education expense appears, sports costs must give
    way as no longer reasonable and necessary”.  She reduced the expense claimed
    for computer costs on the basis that it related to purchases that “need not
    be repeated” and reduced the expense claimed in respect of the car as it
    included “a component that goes beyond necessity”.    </p>

    considering the submission that there was no evidence that these expenses
    were reasonable or necessary, it is important also to keep in mind the circumstances
    in which the motion below was decided.  In para. 5 of the reasons, the motion
    judge notes that this was the third time since separation that issues had
    reached the trial stage and that each time had been preceded by protracted,
    expensive litigation.  In para.&nbsp;8 of the reasons, the motion judge states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Despite this lack of specific evidence, I intend
    a determination.  The parties were set for trial but agreed, for expedience,
    to seek adjudication by way of motion.  Inherent in that agreement is an

    to the children’s support could be reviewed and adjusted annually and specifically
    noted that the review was to include a determination of s.&nbsp;7 expenses.  The
    respondent gave uncontradicted evidence in respect of these matters, including

    education that Table support should continue.  However, having recognised
    that living and accommodation expenses would be covered as part of post-secondary
    education expenses were Brandon to live away from home while attending university,
    she ordered that in such an event, Table support in relation to Brandon would

    issues in respect of child support ordered pursuant to s. 3(2) of the Guidelines.  In
    addition, at the oral hearing of the appeal for the first time, the appellant

    will be recalled that the respondent brought the motion below for a single
    reason: to seek an increased contribution from the appellant towards s. 7
    expenses.  The issue of child support pursuant to s. 3(2) was not raised
    by either party below on the pleadings nor was it argued.  Indeed, the appellant
    filed no pleadings whatsoever below and sought no relief.  He defended the
    motion solely on the basis that the children should be required to exhaust
    their own funds before he was required to contribute to their post-secondary
    education expenses.  It is not open to him to now argue that the children
    are no longer children of the marriage or that he ought not to pay child
    support pursuant to s. 3(2) of the Guidelines.  </p>

    are well known.  See <i>Rodaro v. Royal Bank of Canada </i>(2002), 59 O.R.
    (3d) 74 (C.A.) at para. 60.  At its core, the problems arise from the fact
    that the parties have been denied the opportunity to make and meet the case.  Consequently,
    this court is deprived not only of the benefit of the findings and reasons
    of the judge at first instance in relation to such issues but also of a record
    that contains the evidence necessary to properly consider and decide those
    issues.  That problem is magnified in the current case given the paucity
    of evidence before the motion judge, a matter discussed above.          </p>

'>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    in my view, there is but one issue to be decided on appeal regarding the
    motion judge’s order in respect of table support:  did she err in varying
    the Order by requiring the appellant to pay table support for Brandon only
    for the period in which he lived at home with the respondent?  In my view,
    she did not.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Order that governed child support for many years was based on a settlement
    reached between the parties.  It provides that the appellant is to pay table
    support for the children while they live with the respondent.  The motion
    judge’s order is fully consistent with that.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    it is consistent with the spirit and intent of this court’s decision in <i>Park
    v. Thompson, supra</i>.  At para. 29 of that decision, Rosenberg J.A., writing
    for the court, held that the application judge had erred because he failed
    to consider whether table support was inappropriate given that the adult
    child was living away from home while attending university.  In the case
    at bar, while not stated expressly, it is clear that the motion judge did
    exactly that: she considered whether table support was appropriate given
    that Brandon intended to live away from home while attending university.  Although
    not stated explicitly, it appears that she concluded that because she was
    ordering the appellant to contribute to Brandon’s living costs as part of
    his post-secondary education expenses, it was appropriate that he pay table
    support only for the period during which Brandon lived at home with the respondent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither

    than that which was before her.</p>

    respect, I do not share Juriansz J.A.’s view that the motion judge determined
    Brandon’s contribution pursuant to s. 3(2)(b) of the Guidelines as I hold
    a different view of the relationship between s. 3(2)(b) and s. 7 of the Guidelines.  In
    addition, such a determination is unfair to the parties as they are precluded
    from bringing a s. 3(2)(b) motion in the future, a matter on which I say
    more below.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Guidelines have been enormously beneficial to all those involved with child
    support issues, be they parents, children or courts.  That is due, in large
    part, to the fact that the amount of child support can be determined quickly
    and consistently.  Section&nbsp;3(1) of the Guidelines provides that child
    support for a child under the age of majority is to be (a) the table amount
    plus (b) an amount for s. 7 expenses.  Very often, parties need not have
    recourse to the courts because once the payor parent’s income is known, the
    amount of table support can be determined and special expenses are shared
    in proportion to the parents’ respective incomes.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    3(2) of the Guidelines dictates that the amount of child support for an adult
    child of the marriage is to be the amount determined as if the child were
    under the age of majority, unless that “approach” is inappropriate, in which
    case the court is to set the amount it considers appropriate.  Based on the
    structure and wording of s. 3, in my view, the presumptive amount of child
    support for an adult child of the marriage is the same as that for a child
    under the age of majority.  As Heeney J. wrote in <i>Merritt v. Merritt,
    supra</i>, at para. 55:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As written, the <i>Guidelines </i>do not say that
    the amount of child support <i>should</i> be different just because a child
    is 18 years old.  Quite the reverse.  The presumptive order is the table
    amount.  It is only where the payor, who has the onus of proof, convinces
    the court that the table amount is inappropriate, that a different amount
    may be ordered [emphasis in the original].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    3(2)(b) provides that the court may order a different amount for an adult
    child of the marriage only if the “approach” is inappropriate.  What does
    the word
    “approach” mean in s. 3(2)(b)?  In my view, it refers to the approach set
    out in s. 3(1), namely, setting child support for living expenses based on
    the table and setting child support for special expenses based on s. 7.  Thus,
    the court is to follow the table approach to setting child support for living
    expenses of an adult child of the marriage unless that approach is inappropriate.  If
    it is, the court may order the amount it considers appropriate based on a
    consideration of the
    “condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the child” and the financial
    ability of each parent to contribute to the child’s support.  Similarly,
    the court is to follow the approach to special or extraordinary expenses
    provided by s. 7 unless that approach is inappropriate.  Only if the approach
    mandated by s. 7 is inappropriate is the court to set an appropriate amount
    for such expenses, for an adult child of the marriage, based on s. 3(2)(b).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Arnold
      v. Washburn </i>(2001), 57 O.R. (3d) 287 (C.A.) follows this approach to
      the setting of s. 7 and s. 3 child support.  It does not collapse the two
      but, rather, for adult children of the marriage, the court considered special
      expenses under s. 7 separately from child support for living expenses.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    I do not share Juriansz J.A.’s view that the information required for a s.&nbsp;7
    determination is the same as that required by s. 3(2)(b).  Section 7 is largely
    focussed on income, as opposed to the parents’ full financial situations.  The
    intent of s. 7 is to set out the kinds of expenses that can justify an order
    for support in addition to that ordered under s. 3, the criteria which the
    court is to consider in determining whether the expense is justified and,
    if so, what the amount of the s. 7 expense should be and how the parents
    and child are to share the expense.  The inquiry under s. 7(1) is focussed
    on the special expense – whether it is necessary and reasonable in light
    of the means of the child and the parents and the spending pattern of the
    family while intact.  Section 7(2) deals with the amount that each parent
    is to contribute to that expense by stipulating that, after deducting the
    child’s contribution, the expense is to be shared by the parents in proportion
    to their “respective incomes”.  It can be seen that just as the amount of
    child support ordered pursuant to s. 3 depends on the payor’s income, the
    payor’s income is central to the question of the amount of additional child
    support ordered under s. 7.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    it is true that s. 7(1) requires a wider consideration than simply income,
    in that the “means” of the parents and child are to be considered, it is
    important to contrast that with the wording of s. 3(2)(b) which requires
    a consideration of the “condition, means, needs and other circumstances of
    the child and the financial ability of each spouse to contribute to the support
    of the child”.  Whatever the word “means” encompasses in s.&nbsp;7(1), the
    inquiry must be broader in s. 3(2)(b) as “means” is but one in a list of
    considerations to which the court must have regard.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Not
    only is the inquiry under s. 7 more limited in nature than is that under
    s.&nbsp;3(2)(b), the discretionary nature of the amount of support ordered
    under s. 7 is far more restricted than the discretion conferred under s.
    3(2)(b).  Thus, amounts ordered pursuant to s. 7 are more predictable as
    they are largely a function of the parties’ respective incomes.  Not so child
    support pursuant to s. 3(2)(b) where there are no criteria circumscribing
    the expense and there is no guiding principle on the allocation of expenses
    as between the parents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
    collapsing s. 7 into s. 3(2)(b) ignores the fact that the ultimate recipient
    of the funds is different under the two sections, as explained above.  It
    results in two children in the same family being subject to different legislative
    provisions in respect of post-secondary education expenses solely because
    one child lives away from home while attending university.  As s. 7 specifically
    applies to post-secondary education expenses, in my view, the fact that he
    attends university away from home is insufficient to make the approach mandated
    by s. 7 to the setting of such expenses inappropriate, such that recourse
    to s. 3(2)(b) is necessary.  Most children attending post-secondary education
    are the age of majority or older.  And, by moving from the defined criteria
    in s. 7 to the open-ended type of discretion in s. 3(2)(b), it runs contrary
    to objective 1(b) of the Guidelines which is to increase objectivity in child
    support calculations.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    difference between the evidence required for a s. 7 determination and that
    required by s. 3(2)(b) is well illustrated by the case at bar.  Ms. Lewi
    sought an increased contribution for s. 7 expenses.  The materials filed
    in support of the motion were limited.  Those filed by the appellant, as
    respondent to the motion, were extremely abbreviated.  Nonetheless, the motion
    judge was able to determine what the post-secondary expenses were, whether
    they were necessary and reasonable, and what amount each party ought to contribute
    to those expenses.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    my view of the order below, if Ms. Lewi feels that it is inappropriate that
    she receive table support for Brandon only for the months when he lives with
    her on a full time basis, she would be free to return to the courts and argue,
    pursuant to s. 3(2)(b) of the Guidelines, that setting support based on the
    table approach is inappropriate and that she ought to receive some other
    amount that recognises the on-going costs she bears because she maintains
    a home sufficiently large that it can accommodate Brandon when he returns
    from university on weekends, holidays and during the summer recess.  However,
    she will make the decision whether to undertake that litigation knowing that
    she would bear the burden of proof of demonstrating that the table approach
    to child support is inappropriate.  At a minimum, in my view, s. 3(2)(b)
    dictates that she would have to provide evidence on three matters in addition
    to evidence of income.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    in order to show that the table approach is inappropriate, she would have
    to address the costs associated with maintaining a home for Brandon to return
    to from university.  This evidence would include information on the size
    of the mortgage on her home; what portion of the mortgage is attributable
    to maintaining a residence large enough to accommodate Brandon when he lives
    with her for any length of time; the cost of utilities, water and taxes and
    what part of those ongoing costs are properly attributable to providing Brandon
    with accommodation when he is not at university; and, the living expenses
    associated with Brandon’s weekend and holiday visits home.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second type of evidence would be directed towards meeting the requirement
    in s. 3(2)(b) that the court have regard to the
    “financial ability of each parent to contribute to the support of the child[ren]”.  This
    type of financial information goes far beyond the information required to
    show the “means” and
    “income” of the parties in s. 7.  It suggests an examination of the full
    extent of the parents’ financial situations, including a consideration of
    their assets and savings and what has happened to their respective financial
    positions since separation.  Arguably, the reasons for any significant changes
    in the parties’ financial positions will be relevant to their ability to
    contribute to the child’s support.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    the limited record in this case reveals the complexity likely to arise when
    such matters are before the court.  Ms. Lewi says that her financial position
    has deteriorated since separation because she has borne the bulk of costs
    associated with raising the children.  Mr. Lewi says the decline is a result
    of her inappropriate spending and failure to obtain employment.  Obtaining
    the requisite financial information is likely to be costly and time consuming.  The
    process of each party challenging the other’s information is likely not only
    to be protracted but also highly conflicted, as well as costly and time consuming.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third type of evidence that would have to be led relates to the child’s situation.  As
    noted above, s. 7(1) requires the court to consider the reasonableness of
    a proposed expense in relation to, among other things, the “means” of the
    child whereas s. 3(2)(b) requires the court to have regard to the “condition,
    means, needs and other circumstances of the child”.  Whatever the word “means” encompasses
    for the purposes of s. 7(1), it must necessarily be less fulsome in nature
    than the inquiry into the child’s situation is pursuant to s. 3(2)(b).  For
    one thing, the issue of the child’s means in s. 7(1) is for the limited purpose
    of determining the reasonableness of a particular expense.      <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    on my view that the order below was made pursuant to s. 3(2)(a), Mr.&nbsp;Lewi
    has the right to return to court to argue that the table approach for either
    or both of the children is inappropriate given the extent of their resources
    and that some other amount should be ordered pursuant to s. 3(2)(b).  Again,
    however, if he chooses to engage in such litigation, he will do so knowing
    that he bears the burden of proof and that s. 3(2)(b) requires much evidence
    in order to discharge that burden.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the circumstances of this case for the reasons already given, there is no
    basis on which to interfere with the motion judge’s order in respect of table
    support on the assumption that it was made pursuant to s. 3(2)(a).  Neither
    party requested that she make an order pursuant to s. 3(2)(b).  The evidence
    necessary to make such a determination was not before her nor is it before
    us.  Furthermore, to uphold her order on the basis of s.&nbsp;3(2)(a) preserves
    the right of both parties to return to the court to litigate the appropriateness
    of table support pursuant to s. 3(2)(b).  As such, it respects the fairness
    principle that underpins the adversarial process in that both parties will
    be free to make and meet the case of the appropriateness of table support.  Accordingly,
    I have assumed that the motion judge acted pursuant to s. 3(2)(a) in relation
    to both Darren and Brandon and would leave undisturbed her order in that
    regard.  <i></i></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that if the court finds that there are valid s.&nbsp;7 expenses
    and that the children do not have an obligation to pay all such expenses,
    income should be imputed to the respondent for the purpose of determining
    the parties’ respective contributions to the s. 7 expenses.  He contends
    that although the respondent struggles with depression, she could find some
    measure of employment and that it is not unreasonable for her to be in a
    position now to achieve some self-sufficiency and contribute to the support
    of the children.  He points to s. 1 of the Guidelines which states that one
    of the objectives is “to establish a fair standard of support for children
    that ensures that they continue to benefit from the financial means of both
    spouses after separation.”  He asks for an order that all s. 7 expenses be
    shared equally between the parents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

    those circumstances, and in light of the appellant’s acknowledgement of the

    I explain, this case raises the issue of children’s contribution to their
    post-secondary education both under s. 7 and s. 3(2)(b) of the Guidelines,
    though on the facts of this case, I see no difference in the analysis to
    be employed or the conclusion that would result.  I would find that the motion
    judge erred by failing to require the children to make a contribution to
    their post-secondary expenses out of their capital. </p>

    born April 15, 1987, who live with the respondent.  In March of 2004, the
    respondent brought a motion to vary the child support order then in place,
    seeking an increase in the appellant’s contribution to s. 7 expenses including
    post-secondary education expenses.  Darren was then attending his first year
    at the University of Toronto Scarborough campus, while residing with his
    mother.  Brandon was in high school but planned to attend the University
    of Western Ontario in the fall of 2005 and live in residence.  Darren is
    now in his third year at the University of Toronto.  Brandon is in his first
    year at the University of Western Ontario. </p>

    was that Darren had investments of $41,821.07 and a car purchased for $20,000.  Brandon
    had investments worth $41,822.28.  In addition there was a RESP in the children’s
    joint names in the amount of $7,140.35.  The reduction in the boys’ assets,
    which were administered by the respondent, was not due to expenditures but
    to investment losses.</p>

    agree with Gillese J.A. that the appellant cannot raise for the first time
    on appeal the question whether the boys are children of the marriage.  This
    appeal and cross-appeal is about the amount of child support ordered.  Whether
    children of majority age are “children of the marriage” under the <i>Divorce
    Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985 (2nd Supp.), c. 3 (the “Act”) determines the threshold
    issue whether they are eligible for support.  That is an analytically distinct
    question from the quantum of support to be ordered for them, which involves
    different considerations and the application of different provisions. </p>

    brief discussion of s. 3(2) of the Guidelines is necessary for me to indicate
    why I consider it implicit that the motion judge considered it, and to explain
    why it was necessary for her to do so. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the motion was brought when Brandon was still a minor, it was prospective
    in nature in that it sought contribution for the boys’
    post-secondary education expenses when they both would be over the age of
    majority.  The amount of child support for a child over the age of majority
    is to be determined pursuant to s. 3(2) of the Guidelines.  Section 3(2)
    can only be understood in the context of s. 3(1).  Section 3 provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>3.(1) Unless otherwise provided under these Guidelines, the amount
      of a child support order for children under the age of majority is  </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span

      income of the spouse against whom the order is sought; and  </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    3(1) provides that the “amount of a child support order” for a minor child
    is composed of two components:  the amount set out in the applicable table
    and the amount, if any, under s. 7.  The tables referred to in s. 3(1)(a)
    are the Federal Child Support Tables set out in Schedule I of the Guidelines.  Section
    7 allows a court to provide for an amount to cover all or any portion of
    special or extraordinary expenses.  As I read s. 3(1), expenses ordered under
    s. 7 are not added to the amount of a child support order, but are part of
    it.  I understand Laskin J.A.’s comment at para. 25 of <i>Andrews v. Andrews </i>(1999),
    45 O.R. (3d) 577 (C.A.) to describe an expense under s. 7 as an “add-on” to
    the table amount.  While the application of s. 3(1) is subject to the exception “unless
    otherwise provided under these Guidelines,” there is a presumption in favour
    of the amount determined by s. 3(1):  <i>Francis v. Baker</i>,<span style='font-size:

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    3(2) provides two ways of determining the amount of child support for a child
    of majority age.  Under s. 3(2)(a), the amount of support for a child over
    the age of majority is calculated in exactly the same way as that for a minor
    child.  The opening words of s. 3(2)(b) indicate that the amount determined
    by applying s. 3(2)(a) is the presumptive amount.  Section 3(2)(a), by adopting
    the same approach for children of majority age that applies to minor children,
    fosters predictability, consistency and efficiency in the resolution of disputes
    concerning the amount of support for children of majority age. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    3(2)(b) only comes into play “if the court considers that approach to be
    inappropriate”.  It is apparent that the word “approach” was chosen with
    care, as the word “amount”
    is used six times in the section.  In this way, s. 3(2)(b) differs from s.
    4, which provides the court with discretion to depart from the “amount” determined
    under s. 3 where it considers that amount to be inappropriate.  The words “that
    approach” refer to the technique dictated by s. 3(2)(a)—namely applying the
    Guidelines “as if the child were under the age of majority”.  I will refer
    to that technique as the
    “standard Guidelines approach”.  Before resorting to its discretion under
    s. 3(2)(b), the court must conclude that it is inappropriate to apply the
    Guidelines as if the child who is actually of majority age were a minor.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    word “approach” makes it clear that the court cannot depart from the application
    of the Guidelines simply because it considers the
    “amount” determined under s. 3(2)(a), <i>i.e.</i>, the table amount or additional
    expenses under s. 7, to be inappropriate.  It must be satisfied that the
    standard Guidelines approach is inappropriate; clearly an exceptional situation
    rather than the rule.  This further promotes predictability, consistency
    and efficiency in family law litigation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    two earlier decisions of this court, <i>Arnold v. Washburn</i> (2001), 57
    O.R. (3d) 287 (C.A.) and <i>Park v. Thomson</i> (2005), 77 O.R. (3d) 601
    (C.A.), this court has referred to the issue of the “amount”
    determined under the Guidelines being inappropriate in the context of s.
    3(2)(b).  In both those cases, the court’s discussion makes it apparent that
    the issue raised was whether applying the standard Guidelines approach to
    a child of majority age was inappropriate in the particular circumstances.  In
    my view, neither case decided that a court may resort to its discretion under
    s. 3(2)(b) merely because it considers the “amount” that results from the
    standard Guidelines approach to be unsuitable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have already indicated my view that the appeal cannot be confined to a consideration
    of s. 7 of the Guidelines alone.  That Ms. Lewi’s motion materials mentioned
    only s. 7 and neither party expressly relied on s. 3(2)(b) did not restrict
    the motion judge from considering other provisions of the Guidelines that
    might be pertinent.  Ms. Lewi brought a motion to vary an earlier child support
    order.  As s. 2(4) provides, the order sought is governed by the whole of
    the Guidelines.  The motion concerned child support for children of majority
    age and required consideration of s. 3(2) of the Guidelines. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is worth noting that in <i>Park v. Thompson</i>, <i>supra</i>, this court
    found the application judge had erred by failing to consider s. 3(2)(b) even
    though it had not been pursued.  In <i>Arnold v. Washburn</i>, <i>supra</i>,<span style='color:black'> Carthy
    J.A. noted (at para. 10) that</span> “the trial judge never did turn to s.
    3(2) of the Guidelines to determine if the amount otherwise indicated by
    the Guidelines was appropriate for children of the age of majority.”  On
    appeal, Carthy J.A. nonetheless considered and applied s. 3(2)(b).</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[133]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    motion judge, however, did not expressly refer to s. 3(2) of the Guidelines.  I
    consider it apparent, however, that she implicitly considered that section.  She
    varied the amount of table support payable by Mr. Lewi, a matter that is
    dealt with under s. 3 of the Guidelines and not s. 7.  I have already stated
    that the motion judge was required to consider s. 3(2) as the motion before
    her concerned child support for children of majority age.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[134]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is a reasonable inference that the motion judge determined child support
    for Darren under s. 3(2)(a).  For Brandon, under the scenario that he would
    go away to university, the motion judge determined support under s. 3(2)(b).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[135]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her reasons, the motion judge stated that, “Darren has chosen to remain at
    home.  His undergraduate university expenses are therefore moderate and his
    living expenses are addressed through table Guideline support”.  This indicates
    that she was not persuaded that it was inappropriate to apply the Guidelines
    as if Darren were a minor and proceeded to determine child support for him
    under s. 3(2)(a).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[136]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    see no basis to interfere with the motion judge’s approaching Darren’s support
    as if he were a child under the age of majority and concluding his living
    expenses were to be addressed through table Guideline support. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[137]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect of Brandon, the motion judge said, </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[I]f one boy attends university away from home
    Table support is reduced from support for 2 children to support for 1 plus
    1/3 the difference between one and two.  This amount is to be paid monthly
    throughout the year but reflects that one child is only home for 1/3 the
    year.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[138]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
    matter what view one takes of this statement, it indicates the motion judge
    considered it inappropriate to apply the Guidelines as if Brandon were a
    minor throughout the year.  Under the standard Guidelines approach of s.
    3(1), a child support order for a minor child must include the amount stipulated
    by the tables (unless ss. 4, 9, or 10 apply).  In my view, the motion judge
    considered it inappropriate to treat Brandon as a minor because he would
    be living away from home for eight months of the year.  There is no other
    basis upon which she had discretion to depart from the standard Guidelines
    approach. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[139]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    seems the motion judge went on to deal with Brandon’s special expenses, which
    would be incurred during or in respect of the eight months he lived away
    from home, under s. 7.  In my view, having concluded it was inappropriate
    to treat Brandon as a minor, she should have dealt with child support for
    him under s. 3(2)(b).  However, this is of no consequence as, in the circumstances
    of this case, I see no difference in analysis or result.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[140]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    this case raises the issue of children’s contribution to post-secondary education
    expenses under both s. 7 (for Darren) and s. 3(2)(b) (for Brandon).  I would
    find that the motion judge erred in the way she dealt with the contribution
    expected of each of them.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[141]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    s. 7 and s. 3(2)(b) require the court to consider whether a child of majority
    age is able to make a contribution to his or her post-secondary education
    expenses.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[142]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    3(2)(b) requires the court to have regard to the
    “means” of the child.  Both capital and income are encompassed by the term “means”.  (Whether
    credit is within the ambit of “means” does not arise on this appeal.)  The
    section requires the court to consider the child’s means in the context of
    the financial ability of each of the parents to contribute to the support
    of the child.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[143]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are several indicators in s. 7 that the court is required to consider the
    child’s ability to make a contribution toward post-secondary education expenses.  First,
    s. 7 requires the court to take into account the necessity and reasonableness
    of the expense in relation to the “means of the spouses <u>and those of the
    child</u>” (emphasis added).  The phrase “all or any portion” in s. 7 (1)
    allows the court to provide an amount to cover only a portion of the expense
    at issue.  Most apparent is s. 7 (2), which provides that amount of the expense
    to be shared by the parents is arrived at “after deducting…the contribution,
    if any, from the child”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[144]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with Gillese J.A. that the motion judge did not consider whether Darren
    and Brandon should make a contribution to their post-secondary education
    expenses out of their capital assets.  The contribution she expected them
    to make was from summer earnings she imputed to them.  Her remark about the
    money coming from the trust is simply an observation of the consequence if
    the imputed income was not earned and contributed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[145]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the motion judge did not consider the purchase of Darren’s car to
    be a capital contribution towards his education expenses.  The car had already
    been purchased and she found that, “[t]he choice of car ownership as the
    means of transportation includes in it a component that goes beyond necessity”,
    and allowed only a portion of its insurance cost as a s. 7 expense.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[146]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
    doubt because of the way the matter was argued before her, the motion judge
    focused on whether the gifts from the grandfather were in trust for the boys’ education.  She
    found that there was no designated education fund.  In finding that the boys
    were not required to use the gifted money for their education, she said “I
    am not satisfied that there is a term [that the money be used for education]
    that could be enforced even if I find that was the settlor’s intention.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[147]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respondent’s
    counsel argued that the money was given to the boys as gifts and they could
    use it in any way they wished.  That is true.  The issue, however, is not
    whether there was a legal requirement that the money be used for the boys’ education,
    but rather, whether the boys should be expected to contribute to their education
    expenses out of their own money.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[148]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is worth noting that the motion judge could not, and was not called upon
    to make an order requiring the boys to expend their funds as the court directed.  The
    issue before the motion judge was the amount of child support to be paid
    by one spouse to the other.  In deciding that question, the court was obliged
    to consider the means of the children and the contribution they should be
    expected to make to their post-secondary education.  The order made on the
    motion for child support could affect the legal rights and obligations only
    of the parents and not of the children.  For this reason, I consider the
    question whether Darren owes Brandon $10,000 for the purchase of the car
    to be beyond the ambit of this proceeding.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[149]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge did consider the effect of her order on the parents.  She found
    that the order would place a significant financial burden on both parents
    that would require some personal sacrifice.  She found that the expenses
    were of a type that both parents would have promoted had the family remained
    intact.  In her order, she sought to preserve the existing proportion of
    net disposable income between them.  These are all proper concerns whether
    the analysis is performed under s. 7 or s. 3(2)(b).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[150]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    error of the motion judge was in failing to include the boys’ capital assets
    in the analysis.  In fact, in her reasons she did not even state what those
    capital assets are.  The fact that Darren has $41,821.07 and Brandon has
    $41,822.28 is found in the record, but was not mentioned in the motion judge’s
    decision.  Counsel for the mother conceded that there is no place in the
    motion judge’s reasons where the means of the children and the means of the
    parents are considered together and balanced.  </p>

    $4,189.95 in 2005/2006, which will be Darren’s fourth year and Brandon’s

    four scenarios set out by the motion judge have the father’s income increasing

    as being $28,042 in the 2003/2004 school year, with the amount of $1,666
    still owing.  That obligation increases to $33,332 in 2005/2006.  In addition,
    the father was ordered to pay $300 a month or $3,600 per year in other s.
    7 expenses.  The father also pays spousal support in the amount of $42,000

    of the children and the financial ability of the spouses to contribute to
    the children’s support”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[156]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    7 also specifies some general criteria and leaves it to the court’s discretion
    to decide:</p>
  <p>1. whether the court should provide an amount to cover all or a part of
    an expense;</p>
  <p>2. the reasonableness of the expense;</p>
  <p>3. the means of the spouses;</p>
  <p>4. the means of the child;</p>
  <p>5. the family’s spending pattern prior to separation;</p>
  <p>6. the amount of the contribution of the child, if any; and</p>
  <p>7. whether the court should depart from the guiding
    principle that the spouses should share the expense in proportion to their
    incomes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[157]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    seems to me that the court, in order to exercise its discretion properly
    under either section 3(2)(b) or section 7, when parties dispute the amount
    of contribution expected of a child, requires the same kind of information
    regarding the needs of the child and the means of the child and parents.  Nor
    would the contribution the child is expected to make and the support the
    parent is obliged to provide necessarily be different under the two provisions.  In
    my view, in fashioning an order applying the broad criteria in 3(2)(b), the
    court may well draw upon the principles of the Guidelines and its experience
    in applying them.  For example, it would be entirely appropriate for the
    court, under s. 3(2)(b), to consider that the parents should share post-secondary
    expenses in proportion to their incomes after deducting the contribution,
    if any, of the child.  The evidence upon which the court might conclude it
    was just and appropriate that the parents should share the expenses in some
    other proportion would, I think, be the same under both provisions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[158]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with Gillese J.A. that the all or nothing positions advanced by each
    of the parents in this case must be rejected.  There is nothing in the Guidelines
    that implies that children of majority age with capital assets should be
    required to contribute all of their assets towards their post-secondary education
    before their parents are called upon to provide support, or that such children
    should not have to make any contribution out of their capital.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[159]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    s. 3(2)(b) and s. 7 of the Guidelines require that the means of the child
    must be considered along with the means of the parents.  Section 7, in addition,
    refers to the contribution of the child, if any.  I do not understand this
    to indicate a greater expectation for the child’s contribution under s. 7
    compared to s. 3(2)(b).  The court has the discretion under both provisions
    to decide the amount the child should be expected to contribute.  In my view,
    the amount of child support that a parent is ordered to pay should be determined,
    as a general rule, on the expectation that a child with means, in this case
    independent assets, will contribute something from those means towards his
    or her post-secondary school education.  The extent of the contribution expected
    depends on the circumstances of the case.  There is no standard formula under
    either s. 7 or s. 3(2)(b).   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[160]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the motion judge did not consider the extent to which the children should
    be expected to contribute to their own education expenses out of their capital
    assets, her disposition cannot stand and must be set aside.  As discretion
    to decide the amount of that contribution is the motion judge’s, the usual
    disposition would be to remit the matter.  This would cause additional expense
    and inconvenience to the parties.  I note that the parties agreed to avoid
    a trial and have the issues determined by way of motion on a limited record.  That
    limited record is before us and I would decide the matter in the summary
    fashion the parties elected.  Before doing so, it is necessary to deal with
    Ms. Lewi’s cross-appeal, as the amount of the child support order to be made
    in respect of education expenses will depend on other amounts ordered.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US>The Cross-appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[161]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the cross-appeal, Ms. Lewi asks that Mr. Lewi be required to pay unreduced
    table support for twelve months of the year and to contribute to the children’s
    post-secondary education expenses in proportion to his income without contribution
    by the children.  For the reasons just given above I would dismiss the second
    aspect of the cross-appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[162]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for Ms. Lewi submitted that the motion judge erred by failing to determine
    child support for children according to the presumed approach of s. 3(2)(a)
    of the Guidelines.  She submitted that unreduced table support throughout
    the year is consistent with the principles articulated in <i>Francis v. Baker,
    supra</i> and would promote the objectives of the Guidelines stated in s.
    1.  She described the approach set out in <i>Merritt v. Merritt</i>, [1999]
    O.J. No. 1732 (S.C.J.) as formulaic and pointed out that the living expenses
    covered by table support would still be incurred even though the child was
    away at university.  For example, the child would not be eating at home,
    but table support could be applied to the meal plan of the university’s residence.  Stating
    the obvious, she observed that costs go up, not down, when children go away
    to university.  The proper approach, she submitted, is to order unreduced
    table support, apply that table support to as much of the living expenses
    of the child at university as possible, and resort to s. 7 for the additional
    costs of post-secondary education.  This approach, she submitted, would preserve
    the objective and predictable calculation of child support pursuant to the
    Guidelines and reserve the bulk of discretion to the application of s. 7.  This
    approach, she submitted, must be used unless the husband establishes, with
    clear and compelling evidence, that it is inappropriate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[163]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, it would have been open to the motion judge to proceed in this way.  However,
    the decision of this court in <i>Park v. Thompson</i>, <i>supra</i>, makes
    it clear she did not err by concluding it would be inappropriate to apply
    the Guidelines to Brandon as if he were a minor because he would be attending
    a university out of town.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[164]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    may also be observed that having taken this view, she could have used a different
    analysis to arrive at the reduced table support for Brandon.  For example,
    she could have regarded the portion of table support for Brandon as one half
    of the table support for two children, rather than the increment in table
    support for one child to two children.  It may also be said that one-third
    table support for Brandon, while reflecting that he would be living at home
    only one-third of the year, fails to recognize the ongoing costs of maintaining
    a home for him to return to during the summers and other holidays.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[165]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless,
    the reduced table amount must be considered in the context of the entire
    child support order.  The motion judge was entitled to exercise her discretion
    to reduce table support for Brandon in ordering, in total, an amount she
    considered appropriate having regard to the criteria in s. 3(2)(b).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[166]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regarding
    the motion judge’s reduction of the table amount for Brandon as an exercise
    of discretion under s. 3(2)(b), I would dismiss the cross-appeal.  If I viewed
    the motion as limited to the application of s. 7 alone, I would have allowed
    the cross-appeal on the basis that the motion judge had no discretion to
    depart from the table amount. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US>The Contributions Expected
      of the Children</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[167]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Though
    Darren’s contribution is to be determined under s. 7 and Brandon’s under
    s. 3(2)(b), I would analyze the contribution to be expected of each child
    in the same way.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[168]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to the evidence regarding the amount of the children’s anticipated
    post-secondary expenses, their assets, and the means of the parents set out
    above, I would consider the evidence regarding the source of the funds and
    the parents’ intentions regarding post-secondary expenses before separation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[169]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the motion judge’s finding that the evidence did not establish
    the grandfather constituted an educational trust.  However, I would bear
    in mind his evidence that he made the gifts of money to the children for
    their education.  I would not attach great weight to the fact the parents
    paid the private school fees of the children when they were minors.  They
    are no longer minors in elementary or high school.  In my view, a spending
    pattern deserving of weight would be where the parents had paid the post-secondary
    education expenses of older siblings before separation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[170]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the same time, I would heed the unchallenged affidavit of Ms. Lewi that prior
    to separation,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There was never any discussion about an education
    fund for the children as there appeared to be no need for one.  At that time
    we were both working and had a significant family income.  The monies gifted
    to the children were always viewed by us as a nest egg for them to get a
    start in life, i.e. to help buy their first home, a car, etc. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[171]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is fundamental that the lifestyle of children should suffer as little as
    possible as a consequence of their parents separating.  If the parents would
    have paid the educational expenses of the children had they not separated,
    then, all things being equal, the children should be entitled to expect they
    would pay them even though the parents have separated.  That proposition
    applies to this case.  However, regrettably, circumstances have changed.  The
    major difference is that it is no longer the case that both parents are working
    and earning a significant family income.  At the present time, the source
    of the child support contributions of both parents is the employment income
    of Mr. Lewi.  While he is a relatively high-income earner, his financial
    ability to contribute, and the reasonableness of the entire expense in relation
    to the parents’ and the children’s means has been affected.  Ms. Lewi has
    less discretionary income than she had prior to separation.  She deposed
    that her “circumstances changed dramatically” after she became unemployed
    and she has had to downsize her home twice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[172]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge found the children’s education expenses would be a “significant
    financial burden” on the parents, but one they could afford by making “personal
    sacrifice”.  The money the grandfather gave to the children for their education
    is available.  As the motion judge’s order of table support for Darren remains
    in place and he is living with his mother, both parents continue to make
    significant contributions to his support while he attends university.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[173]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    I observe that the structure of the motion judge’s order may be regarded
    as a disincentive to earn more than the income she imputed to them.  Under
    her order, any amounts they earn above the minimums she set must be contributed
    to their expenses.  If they do not earn more than the minimum, their parents
    must pay for the remaining expenses.  As the order I make would leave the
    boys with assets even if they do not work, it is possible and preferable
    to simply set the amount they are expected to contribute and leave it to
    them to earn as much as they can during the summers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[174]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Considering
    these matters, in the case of Darren, I would determine the amount of child
    support on the expectation that he will pay his entire educational expenses
    for tuition, books, supplies, parking and orientation.  The motion judge’s
    order that he make a contribution out of imputed summer earnings becomes
    redundant and I would set it aside.  Darren is simply responsible for his
    own education expenses.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[175]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would also set aside the term of the motion judge’s order requiring the parents
    to restore to this capital the contribution made to the RESP out of it.  The
    money in the RESP must be directed to education expenses in accordance with
    the requirements of the government programme that governs it.  A remedy for
    any misallocation of the children’s money to the RESP at an earlier time
    is beyond the scope of a motion regarding child support.  This comment should
    not be taken as a suggestion there was any misallocation in this case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[176]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Darren’s
    share of the RESP will reduce the total of his undergraduate expenses, as
    estimated by the trial judge at $24,167.57, to about $20,000.  Assuming that
    there is no change in his assets of $41,167.57 and that he applies $10,000
    of his summer earnings to his expenses as the motion judge considered he
    should, he would be left with more than $30,000 in capital assets on graduation.  [$41,821.07 –$24,167.57
    + $10,000 + $3,500 from the RESP].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[177]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Brandon’s
    situation is more complex and his expenses are much higher.  Yet Brandon,
    though a child of the marriage for the purposes of the <i>Divorce Act</i>,
    is an adult who is responsible for the choices he has made.  He has chosen
    to go to university out of town at much greater cost.  I would order an amount
    of child support for him that expects a commensurately greater contribution
    from him, while still leaving him with assets on graduation that are roughly
    comparable to those Darren will be left with.  I would order an amount of
    child support based on the expectation that he will contribute one-half of
    his educational expenses.  I would set aside the order that he contribute
    $10,000 out of summer earnings.  For the reasons given, I would also set
    aside the term of the order that the parents restore the contribution to
    his capital made to the RESP. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[178]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Using
    $16,000 as the average estimate of the motion judge of his yearly undergraduate
    expenses, Brandon’s total expenses would $64,000.  His share of the RESP
    would reduce that to about $60,000.  Ignoring any scholarships or bursaries
    he might receive, the order that he pay one-half of his expenses would require
    him to contribute an additional $30,000.  Assuming no change in his capital
    of $41,821.07, and that he applies $10,000 of summer earnings to his expenses
    as the motion judge expected, he can expect to have almost $22,000 in assets
    on graduation.  [$41,822.28-(50% of $60,000= $30,000) + $10,000 = $21,822.28].  I
    would not consider the scenario where his expenses rise to $30,000 per year
    in his third and fourth years.  The motion judge proceeded on the basis that
    a claim for post-secondary education expenses outside the range of $15,000
    to $17,000 would constitute unforeseen circumstances that would trigger a
    reconsideration.</p>
