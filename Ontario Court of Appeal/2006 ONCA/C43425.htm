  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since September 2000, the Ontario government (“Ontario”) has
    provided assistance to preschool autistic children who are between two and five
    years old through what it calls the Intensive Early Intervention Program (the
    “IEIP”).  After a lengthy trial, the
    trial judge decided that the exclusion from this program of autistic children
    age six and over and the failure to provide it to them as a special education
    program in school, discriminates against them on the basis of age and
    disability, and therefore violates the equality guarantee in the <i>Charter of
    Rights and Freedoms</i>.  Moreover, it
    is not a reasonable limit that can be justified in a free and democratic
    society.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is the appeal by Ontario from that decision.  For the reasons that follow, we have
    concluded that the appeal must be allowed. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE TRIAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These proceedings began as two separate actions although they
    were tried together.  One was known as
    the Wynberg action and the other as the Deskin action.  The actions sought relief on behalf of
    thirty-five autistic children and their parents.  All of the children had turned six by the time the trial concluded
    on September 3, 2004.  The infant
    plaintiffs were therefore all autistic children age six and over.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In general terms, the expert witnesses called at the trial all
    agreed that autism, or autistic disorder, encompasses a spectrum of disorders
    characterized by pervasive difficulties in reciprocal social interaction,
    pervasive impairments in verbal and non-verbal interaction, and a pattern of
    restricted repetitive and unusual behaviours and interests.  There is no doubt that it is a devastating
    paediatric disorder.  This is brought
    home forcefully by the trial judge’s description at para. 40 of her reasons of
    the personal stories she heard in evidence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Parents or other caregivers from more than half of
    the families gave evidence.  Virtually
    every one of the parents described circumstances of the children that
    personalized the clinical descriptions in a manner that could only be described
    as heartbreaking. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge described in detail the evolution of the
    IEIP.  Prior to 1998, there were no
    publicly funded intensive services in Ontario for preschool children with
    autism.  This began to change in 1998,
    in significant measure because of the efforts of Brenda Deskin, the mother of
    Michael Deskin.  Michael had been
    diagnosed with autistic disorder in January of that year, at the age of
    thirty-five months.  She brought this
    issue to the attention of the senior officials in the provincial Ministry of
    Community and Social Services (MCSS), the Ministry of Education and the
    Ministry of Health, and supplied them with comprehensive and persuasive
    documentation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>MCSS responded by beginning work on what would become the
    IEIP.  It took the lead within the
    provincial government to develop a framework for the program and secure the
    necessary funding for it.  By September
    2000, MCSS had created, revised and released the IEIP Guidelines describing the
    program and setting out the criteria for it, and in that month, autistic
    children age two to five began to receive services through the IEIP in those
    regions of Ontario where service providers were ready to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In brief measure, the Guidelines describe the IEIP as follows:
    it is to provide intensive behavioural intervention services for autistic
    children to begin as early as possible after early identification or
    diagnosis.  It is to be intensive and
    delivered as a direct service, which, to be effective, ranges from twenty to
    forty hours per week, typically lasting for one to two years.  It is to be delivered by well-trained staff
    who are monitored and evaluated by highly trained experts.  It is expected that systematic behavioural
    teaching methods will be used.  One-to-one structured programming, which is usual at the outset, is to
    be used as appropriate.  Other
    systematic methods are also to be used when appropriate for the child’s skill
    level or stage of progress.  The program
    will occur in a variety of settings and involve parents and caregivers directly
    in the child’s treatment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, as the IEIP unfolded, it became apparent that the
    need was greater than the capacity of the program.  By October 2002, the shortage of professionals and therapists meant
    that the number of children turning six and becoming ineligible without ever
    having received this service exceeded the number being served by the program.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was also apparent by then that the education system was not
    responding to the special needs of these children when they entered school,
    through a special education program consistent with the Guidelines.  The legislative provision in issue here is
    s. 8(3) of the <i>Education Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.2, which obliges the
    Minister of Education to ensure that all “exceptional” pupils in Ontario
    (including those with autism) have available to them “appropriate” special
    education programs and services without payment of fees.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was required to decide a number of
    issues.  Her main findings were as

    dismissed.  We will deal with each of
    these issues in turn.  As we do so, we
    will elaborate the relevant facts and reasons of the trial judge and set out

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE LEGAL PRINCIPLES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first two issues raised by Ontario both concern questions
    of equality law.  First, Ontario says
    that the trial judge erred in finding that, by limiting the IEIP to autistic
    children under six, it discriminated against the infant plaintiffs on the basis
    of age.  Second, Ontario says that the
    trial judge erred in finding that it discriminated against the infant
    plaintiffs on the basis of disability by failing to provide them with a special
    education program consistent with the IEIP.  Because both issues are set in the context of s. 15 of the <i>Charter</i>,
    it is helpful to outline the principles of equality law that must inform the
    analysis.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 15(1) expresses the constitutional guarantee of
    equality in clarion language that by now is familiar:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Every individual is equal
    before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal
    benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without
    discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex,
    age or mental or physical disability.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fundamental purpose of the guarantee is to protect against
    the violation of essential human dignity that may arise through disadvantage,
    stereotyping, or political or social prejudice.  It seeks to promote a society in which all persons enjoy equal
    recognition at law as human beings or as members of Canadian society, equally
    capable, and equally deserving of concern, respect, and consideration.  This is the expression of the concept of equality
    articulated in the seminal case of <i>Law v. Canada</i> <i>(Minister of
    Employment and Immigration)</i>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 497 at para. 51.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At para. 53, <i>Law </i>describes the concept of human
    dignity:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Human dignity means that an
    individual or group feels self-respect and self-worth.  It is concerned with physical and
    psychological integrity and empowerment.  Human dignity is harmed by unfair treatment premised upon personal
    traits or circumstances which do not relate to individual needs, capacities, or
    merits.  It is enhanced by laws which
    are sensitive to the needs, capacities, and merits of different individuals,
    taking into account the context underlying their differences.  Human dignity is harmed when individuals and
    groups are marginalized, ignored, or devalued, and is enhanced when laws
    recognize the full place of all individuals and groups within Canadian society.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jurisprudence that begins with <i>Law</i> also makes clear
    that the inquiry mandated by s. 15(1) cannot be conducted as if it were the
    rigid application of a mathematical formula.  Rather, it entails consideration of both the full context in which the
    claim for equality arises and the circumstances of the claimants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Hodge v. Canada (Minister of Human Resources
    Development)</i>, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 357, the Supreme Court of Canada underlines
    that this contextual analysis is to proceed on a comparative basis, comparing
    the equality seeker with others who are similarly situated.  The choice of the comparator group to whom
    the claimant should be compared must be carefully done.  An assertion of the right to be treated
    equally must necessarily entail a comparison with the treatment accorded to
    others in the same circumstances.  Writing for the Court, Binnie J. describes the centrality of the
    comparative approach at para. 1:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A person asking for equal
    treatment necessarily does so by reference to other people with whom he or she
    can legitimately invite comparison. … A s. 15(1) claim will likely fail unless
    it can be demonstrated that the comparison, thus invited, is to a “comparator
    group” with whom the claimant shares the characteristics <u>relevant</u> to
    qualification for the benefit or burden in question apart from the <u>personal</u> characteristic that is said to be the ground of the wrongful discrimination
    [emphasis in original]. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Binnie J. also makes clear that the claimant makes the initial
    choice of the person or group to whom he or she wishes to be compared.  The correctness of the choice, however, is a
    question for the court to determine.  He
    explains the criteria for identifying the appropriate comparator group at para.
    23.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The appropriate comparator
    group is the one which mirrors the characteristics of the claimant (or claimant
    group) relevant to the benefit or advantage sought except that the statutory
    definition includes a personal characteristic that is offensive to the <i>Charter</i> or omits a personal characteristic in a way that is offensive to the <i>Charter</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The proper identification of the comparator group permits the
    court to proceed, on a comparative basis, to the three broad inquiries required
    to analyze a claim of discrimination.  <i>Law </i>describes them this way: first, is the claimant accorded differential
    treatment under the law; second, is that treatment based on one of the
    prohibited grounds listed in s. 15(1) or a ground analogous to them; and third,
    does the differential treatment discriminate in a substantive sense.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is up to the claimant to demonstrate an affirmative answer
    to each of these three questions.  In <i>Law</i>,
    the court described four contextual factors to which a claimant may be able to
    turn to demonstrate discrimination: (i) pre-existing disadvantage,
    stereotyping, prejudice or vulnerability; (ii) the correspondence, or lack
    thereof, between the grounds on which the claim is based and the actual needs,
    capacity or circumstances of the claimant or those he or she is properly
    compared to; (iii) the ameliorative purpose or effect of the impugned law,
    program or activity upon a more disadvantaged person or group in society; and
    (iv) the nature and scope of the interest affected by the impugned governmental
    activity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Hodge</i>, at para. 17, the Court emphasizes that each
    step in this inquiry proceeds on the basis of a comparison between the claimant
    and the appropriate comparator group.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At paras. 59&#8209;60, <i>Law </i>also establishes that the
    inquiry must be undertaken from the perspective of a reasonable person in
    circumstances similar to those of the claimant.  Ultimately, the question is whether, given those circumstances,
    the impugned state action demeans the human dignity of the claimant.  It is this profound and fundamental value
    that the equality guaranteed by s. 15(1) protects.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This framework of analysis is supplemented by s. 15(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  Because of the circumstances in which the
    discrimination claims arise in this case, this requires a brief outline as well.  Section 15(2) reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Subsection (1) does not
    preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration
    of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are
    disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion,
    sex, age or mental or physical disability. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This subsection is dealt with by the Supreme Court of Canada
    in <i>Lovelace v. Ontario</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 950.  The Court found that s. 15(2) should be seen as an interpretive
    aid to s. 15(1), not an exemption from it.  Section 15(2) confirms and advances the goal of substantive equality
    that underpins s. 15(1) by recognizing that ameliorative programs targeted at
    specific disadvantaged groups may significantly contribute to enhancing their
    human dignity.  The Court also makes
    clear that a claim that such a program is discriminatory is properly assessed
    under s. 15(1), but that exclusion from a targeted ameliorative program is less
    likely to be associated with stereotyping or stigmatization or conveying the
    message that the excluded group is less worthy of recognition and participation
    in the larger society than might be the case with exclusion from a more
    comprehensive ameliorative program.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ISSUE ONE:  THE AGE DISCRIMINATION CLAIM</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>a)            The Relevant Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that beginning in October 2002, the
    equality rights of the infant plaintiffs were violated because the IEIP was
    provided to autistic children age two to five, but not to autistic children age
    six and over.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge reached this conclusion after tracing in
    detail the development of the IEIP as a government program in Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In brief, she found that prior to approval by Ontario of the
    concept of the IEIP in April 1999, there were virtually no publicly funded
    services for autistic children of any age.  She noted, however, that there were some limited services for older
    autistic children, such as publicly funded behaviour management in school and
    some limited special education programs and services, although none of these
    services involved the intensive intervention technique of the IEIP. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From the beginning, the proposed IEIP was targeted at autistic
    children age two to five.  The
    government accepted the consensus of the experts in the field that the children
    in this age range presented a window of opportunity for this intensive
    intervention, responded best to it at that age, and should receive it as early
    as possible in their lives.  In
    addition, it was presumed that at the mandatory school age of six, the education
    system would respond appropriately to the needs of autistic children.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In September 2000, Ontario issued the Guidelines for the
    program.  Ultimately the trial judge
    based her legal analysis on the IEIP as it was described at pp. 12&#8209;15 of
    the IEIP Guidelines.  The following are
    its central elements, as reproduced at para. 180 of the trial judge’s reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Intensive Behavioural Intervention</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>For most children in the program, intensive
    behavioural intervention will be the cornerstone of their Individual Service
    Plan.  The intensive behavioural
    intervention provided by regional programs must clearly incorporate
    state-of-the-art best practices. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Regional programs are expected to develop the
    capacity to provide intensive behavioural intervention based on the principles
    described below, which are derived from research findings, expert opinion, and
    clinical practice guidelines developed in other jurisdictions.  The program should have enough flexibility
    to allow the best use of local resources and expertise, and to exercise
    clinical judgment in developing particular parameters of intervention for
    particular children and families.  At
    the same time, however, there is an expectation that regional programs will
    have a common philosophy and approach and will provide a common standard of
    service quality consistently across the province. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Regional programs are expected to provide intensive
    behavioural intervention services which:</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='page-break-after:avoid;'><b>Intensity</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The number of hours of intensive behavioural
    intervention shown by research to be effective ranges from 20 to 40 hours per
    week in different studies.  Within this
    range, the limited research available does not demonstrate any clear
    relationship between the amount of intervention and the child’s outcome.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>However, “intensity” is more than simply the number
    of hours a child spends in intervention.  More importantly, it depends on the quality of intervention provided
    during those hours.  Because of this,
    the program will not set a specific number of hours for intensive behavioural
    intervention.  The intensity of each
    child’s program should be a clinical decision made by the regional program,
    based on the research, and taking into account the following factors:</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Research indicates that

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Based on these findings,

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With the issuing of the Guidelines, autistic children in the
    two to five age group began to receive services through the IEIP in those
    regions of Ontario where the service providers were ready to do so.  Because it was a new program, a major
    training initiative was undertaken to build capacity to deliver the
    service.  However, right from the start,
    capacity was, and remained, an issue.  By June 2001, there was an emerging wait list problem, with children
    turning six and thus reaching the IEIP age cutoff before being able to access
    the program.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that the <i>Charter </i>violations
    commenced as of October 2002.  At that
    point, Ontario remained fully committed that the IEIP was a program targeted to
    help autistic children age two to five and was unavailable to autistic children
    six years of age and older.  As well,
    the experts continued to share the view that the younger age group presented
    the window of opportunity.  However,
    despite significant efforts to train instructor therapists and supervising
    therapists, and to identify supervising psychologists, capacity to deliver the
    service continued to fall short.  Consequently, by October 2002, more children were aging out of the
    eligible years without receiving the service than were being served by the
    program.  And the government was aware
    that the education system was not responding to the special needs of pupils
    with autism in a way that the trial judge found appropriate.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, despite these problems with capacity, termination
    of eligibility at age six, and transition to school, the trial judge concluded
    that the IEIP was in many respects an exemplary program for autistic children
    age two to five.  She also found that
    for school&#8209;age autistic children, by contrast with the two to five age
    group, there was only modest research about the efficacy of intensive intervention.  The most that could be said is that the
    available research did not indicate that it is not effective for this older
    group.  The clinical experience,
    however, was that it continues to be effective, albeit perhaps with less
    pronounced effect than for the younger age group.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is the factual context in which the trial judge began her
    consideration of the claim for age discrimination.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>b)            Our Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fundamental assertion on behalf of the infant plaintiffs
    was that the implementation of the IEIP was done, not with the purpose of
    discriminating against autistic children age six and over, but that it has that
    effect.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The proper comparator group was not an issue before the trial
    judge nor is it in this court.  The
    infant plaintiffs, the claimants here, are autistic children six years of age
    and older.  At trial and in this court,
    all counsel accepted that the appropriate comparator group is autistic children
    age two to five.  The trial judge
    agreed, as do we.  The groups are alike
    except for the personal characteristic of age, which is the basis upon which
    the comparator group is eligible to receive IEIP services while the claimants
    are not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor is there any dispute that the benefit received by the
    comparator group is provided by state action under law.  The IEIP is a program that the Minister of
    Community and Social Services has discretion to undertake pursuant to s.
    7(1)(a) of the <i>Child and Family Services Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.11.  It reads:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> 7(1) The Minister may,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> (a) provide
    services and establish, operate and maintain facilities for the provision of
    services.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In implementing the IEIP pursuant to this subsection, the
    Minister is serving the paramount objective of the <i>Child and Family Services
    Act</i>, which is described in s. 1(1) as the promotion of the best interests,
    protection and well being of children.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, the first two stages of the inquiry mandated by <i>Law</i> are straightforward.  Through the
    Minister’s establishment of the IEIP for autistic children age two to five, the
    state imposes differential treatment on the claimants compared to the
    comparator group.  This is done on the
    basis of age, an enumerated ground in s. 15(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The important question that remains is whether this is
    discriminatory.  Is its purpose or
    effect to demean the human dignity of the claimant group? </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before turning to her discrimination analysis, the trial judge
    qualified her conclusion that the claimants were accorded differential
    treatment based on an enumerated ground.  She found that this began only as of October 2002, because by then it
    was apparent to the Ontario government that the education system was not
    responding to the needs of autistic children age six and over, and more than
    half of the children for whom the IEIP was intended were aging out without receiving
    the service, thereby missing the window of opportunity.  The trial judge concluded that it was
    therefore no longer reasonable to correlate age with eligibility.  As a consequence, she found that the <i>Charter </i>violations (both age discrimination and disability discrimination) only
    commenced in October 2002.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As part of their cross-appeal, the respondents argue that the
    trial judge erred by inserting this step into the equality analysis at this
    point.  They say that the commencement
    date for the differential treatment on the enumerated ground of age must be
    when it first started, not when it ceased being reasonable.  This was September 2000 when the IEIP began
    to deliver services, not in October 2002.  They argue that the declarations issued at trial must be amended to
    provide for the earlier date, since it is the point at which the <i>Charter</i> violations commenced.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario argues that the finding of the trial judge should be
    read as part of her discussion of whether the differential treatment
    constituted discrimination.  In
    particular, it says that this is part of the analysis of the correspondence
    factor described in <i>Law</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We cannot read the reasons of the trial judge as Ontario
    proposes.  Her finding is that the
    differential treatment of the claimants based on age began only when it became
    unreasonable for eligibility to be limited to autistic children age two to five
    to the exclusion of those six and over.  We agree with the respondents that the analysis called for in <i>Law </i>does
    not contemplate such a step in determining whether the claimants experienced
    differential treatment on an enumerated ground.  Indeed, even at the discrimination stage, the assessment focuses
    on the impact of the differential treatment on the human dignity of the
    claimants rather than whether the government actors had good reason to do what
    they did.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the respondents that the differential treatment
    based on age began in September 2000, when the IEIP started to provide
    services.  However, the crux of the
    equality inquiry is whether that differential treatment can be said to
    constitute discrimination.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The answer to this question requires the comparative approach
    and the full contextual analysis described in <i>Law</i> to determine whether
    the claimants have established that their human dignity has been denied or
    demeaned by the differential treatment.  Since <i>Law</i>, that analysis is now organized through the four
    contextual factors or considerations described in that case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first of these is whether, prior to the differential treatment,
    the claimants suffered pre-existing vulnerability, stereotyping or prejudice
    because of the particular personal characteristic.  In other words, are the claimants a disadvantaged group that is
    more vulnerable to this differential treatment because it builds on prior
    stereotyping based on the same characteristic?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded that this is so for the claimant
    group.  She found that the age cutoff in
    the IEIP reflects and reinforces the stereotype that autistic children age six
    and over are virtually unredeemable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We cannot subscribe to that conclusion.  There can be no doubt that, sadly, all
    autistic children, regardless of age, have historically suffered significant
    prejudice and disadvantage because of stereotyping and misconceptions about
    their human potential.  Indeed, at
    trial, counsel filed the following agreed statement of fact:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>That persons with mental
    disabilities, including those with autism, have historically been a vulnerable
    and powerless group who have been stigmatized, and have suffered from
    prejudice, discrimination and stereotyping and may have been segregated from
    the rest of society. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, since the ground of discrimination underpinning this
    claim is age, this contextual factor must turn on whether the claimant group,
    namely autistic children age six and over, has suffered from historic
    disadvantage as a result of stereotyping on the basis of age, not because of
    autism.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This was made clear by McLachlin C.J. in <i>Gosselin v. Quebec
    (Attorney General)</i>, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 429.  The claim advanced in that case was that a welfare scheme providing
    lesser benefits to those under thirty years of age discriminated against them
    compared to welfare recipients who were thirty and older.  In applying this contextual factor the Chief
    Justice said this at para. 35:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Given the lack of
    pre-existing disadvantage experienced by young adults, Ms. Gosselin attempts to
    shift the focus from age to welfare, arguing that <u>all</u> welfare recipients
    suffer from stereotyping and vulnerability.  However, this argument does not assist her claim.  The ground of discrimination upon which she
    founds her claim is <u>age</u>.  The
    question with respect to this contextual factor is therefore whether the
    targeted age-group, comprising young adults aged 18 to 30, has suffered from
    historic disadvantage as a result of stereotyping on the basis of age.  Re-defining the group as welfare recipients
    aged 18 to 30 does not help us answer that question, in particular because the
    30-and-over group that Ms. Gosselin asks us to use as a basis of comparison
    also consists entirely of welfare recipients [emphasis in original]. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, we can see no basis for concluding that prior to
    the implementation of the IEIP, autistic children age six and over had
    historically suffered disadvantage because of their age compared to autistic
    children age two to five, who were targeted by the program.  If anything, the evidence would seem to
    suggest otherwise.  Prior to the IEIP,
    there were no publicly funded services for the younger age group but some
    limited ones for those six and over.  Thus, the failure to implement the intensive intervention model of the
    IEIP for school&#8209;age autistic children, once the program was begun for the
    comparator group, cannot be said to reflect or reinforce pre-existing
    prejudicial attitudes towards older autistic children because of their age.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, from its inception, the IEIP was targeted at the two
    to five age group.  It was designed to
    take advantage of the window of opportunity that all experts agree these children
    present at that age.  It was designed to
    meet their particular circumstances.  The implementation of a program that is so centred on its target group
    carries no message that would worsen any mistaken preconception that, because
    of their age, autistic children age six and over are irredeemable compared to
    the younger group, even if such a pre-existing stereotype existed.  In our view, because the focus of the
    program was entirely on helping the two to five age group, and because it is so
    tailored to their circumstances, it cannot be taken to say anything demeaning
    about older autistic children.  In the
    language of <i>Lovelace, supra</i> at para. 73, the IEIP did not function “by
    device of stereotype” about autistic children age six and older.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second contextual factor described in <i>Law</i> is the
    correspondence, or lack thereof, between the ground on which the claim is based
    (namely the denial of the IEIP to the claimants because of age) and the actual
    needs, capacity or circumstances of the claimants compared to the comparator
    group.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s consideration of this factor is found at
    para. 586 of her reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>While there is evidence that
    the needs, capacity or circumstances of the plaintiff children were taken into
    consideration in establishing entrance eligibility for IEIP, there is no
    evidence that they were considered in establishing exit eligibility.  Indeed, experts such as Dr. Perry, Dr.
    Siegel and Dr. Newman agreed that decisions about the termination of ABA/IBI [a
    designation used by the trial judge to mean intensive behavioural intervention
    consistent with the IEIP Guidelines] ought to be clinical decisions made in
    response to the individual child’s needs and circumstances.  Therefore, I find that there is no
    correspondence between the ground of discrimination and the benefit claimed on
    the one hand, and the actual needs, capacity or circumstances of the plaintiff
    children on the other hand.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, this approach skews the analysis required by this
    factor.  The trial judge’s concern
    appears to be that the exit criterion for autistic children age two to five is
    age rather than individual clinical assessment.  With respect, this is a concern about the use of age as a
    differentiator at all, not a concern that when age is in fact used, it is a basis
    to treat one group differently from another in a way that is
    discriminatory.  In other words, it is
    not a concern about age discrimination.  The claim is not that children in the two to five age group are
    improperly removed from the IEIP program because of age rather than individual
    assessment.  That would not be a claim
    that because of their age they are treated differently than those of another
    age.  Rather, the age discrimination
    claim is that compared to children in the two to five age group, those age six
    and older are not eligible to access the IEIP because of their age, whether
    they were ever previously in the program, aged out of it before receiving any
    services, or were not diagnosed until after they turned six.  It is the circumstances of this older group
    that must be scrutinized here, and, as quoted above, the trial judge seems to
    acknowledge that the needs, capacities and circumstances of the claimant group
    were properly considered in limiting access to the program to those age two to
    five.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the trial judge’s concern is taken to be that the
    complainant group should not be prevented from accessing the IEIP simply on the
    basis of age but only on the basis of individual clinical assessment, the words
    of McLachlin C.J. in <i>Gosselin</i>, <i>supra</i>, are apposite.  There the complaint was, in part, that the
    legislation used age, not individual assessment of need, to determine who
    should receive social assistance.  The
    Chief Justice noted that an element of arbitrariness is inherent in any
    legislative distinction using age.  This
    is because assessment based on age is not assessment based on individual
    circumstances.  However, in grouping
    individuals, age is often properly used as a proxy for the abilities and
    circumstances of the group.  The Chief
    Justice said this at para. 57:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A final objection is that
    the selection of 30 years of age as a cut-off failed to correspond to the
    actual situation of  young adults
    requiring social assistance.  However,
    all age-based legislative distinctions have an element of this literal kind of
    “arbitrariness”.  That does not
    invalidate them.  Provided that the age
    chosen is reasonably related to the legislative goal, the fact that some might
    prefer a different age – perhaps 29 for some, 31 for others – does not indicate
    a lack of sufficient correlation between the distinction and actual needs and
    circumstances.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The full contextual analysis required by this second factor
    must examine the correspondence between the circumstances of each of the
    claimant group and the comparator group and the age differentiation that
    underpins the claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Of fundamental importance is that from the beginning, the IEIP
    has been an ameliorative program targeted at autistic children age two to
    five.  This is the age cohort that is
    best able to benefit from an intensive intervention program.  As the experts agreed, they present a
    “window of opportunity” that the claimant group does not.  Moreover, their circumstances are different
    from those of the claimant group in a second important respect: they are not in
    school.  The core design of the IEIP was
    based on this circumstance, including its intensity as reflected in the hours
    per week, its emphasis on segregated rather than integrated settings, its
    variety of delivery sites, and the range of skilled personnel to be
    employed.  None of these important
    features of the IEIP fit well in the circumstance of autistic children age six
    and older who are in full-time attendance at school.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We therefore conclude that the IEIP corresponds to the
    capacities and circumstances of autistic children in the targeted age
    group.  As the trial judge found, it is
    in many respects an exemplary program for them.  These circumstances differ in important and relevant respects
    from those of autistic children age six and over.  The IEIP simply does not correspond in the same way to the needs,
    capacities and circumstances of the claimant group.  This makes it less likely that the differential treatment
    accorded to the younger group based on age constitutes discrimination against
    the older group.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third contextual factor described in <i>Law</i>,<i> </i>is
    the ameliorative purpose or effect of the impugned state action.  If the state action can be described in this
    way but excludes some from its reach, the question is whether by doing so it
    demeans the human dignity of those excluded.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge addressed this factor by applying the analysis
    in <i>Lovelace</i> and concluding that for two reasons this case, unlike <i>Lovelace</i>,
    is one of those “rare occasions” where a targeted ameliorative program is
    discriminatory.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While we disagree with this conclusion, we agree with her
    starting point.  As we have said, the
    IEIP is clearly an ameliorative program targeted at a specific disadvantaged
    group, namely autistic children age two to five.  As in <i>Lovelace</i>, the claimant group (in this case, autistic
    children age six and older) is also a disadvantaged group.  However, they are not excluded from a <u>comprehensive</u> ameliorative program, which would rarely escape the charge of discrimination:
    see <i>Law</i> para. 72 and <i>Vriend v. Alberta</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 493 at
    para. 96. Rather they are excluded from an ameliorative program targeted at a
    disadvantaged group.  In <i>Lovelace</i>,
    at para. 85, Iacobucci J. says that in such circumstances the focus of analysis
    is not on the fact that the comparator and the claimant groups are equally
    disadvantaged, but rather that the program in question was targeted at
    ameliorating the conditions of the specific disadvantaged group.  He concluded that when this is so, exclusion
    from the program is less likely to demean the human dignity of those excluded
    even though they too are a disadvantaged group.  He put it this way at para. 86:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[O]ne must recognize that
    exclusion from a targeted or partnership program is less likely to be
    associated with stereotyping or stigmatization or conveying the message that
    the excluded group is less worthy of recognition and participation in the
    larger society.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge offered two reasons why this case is different
    from <i>Lovelace</i> and that therefore this conclusion should not apply.  With respect, we find both reasons
    flawed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First the trial judge found that, unlike this case, the
    program in issue in <i>Lovelace</i> was the product of a partnership between
    the Ontario government and the targeted disadvantaged group.  As a related point, she found it important
    that both the complainant group and the comparator group in <i>Lovelace</i> already existed before the impugned program was created.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, these factors do not make this case different
    from <i>Lovelace</i> nor render its reasoning inapplicable.  In <i>Lovelace</i>, the court found that the
    input of the targeted group in creating the program made it more likely that
    the result would correspond to the needs of that group.  However, such input is clearly not a
    prerequisite for correspondence.  Careful tailoring by government can also produce a high degree of
    correspondence, which is what happened here.  Both this case and <i>Lovelace</i> reflect a high degree of
    correspondence between the particular ameliorative program and the
    circumstances of the targeted group.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Equally, this case is no different from <i>Lovelace </i>in
    that the claimant group and the comparator group both existed before the
    creation of the impugned program.  Here
    there was, in fact, considerable trial time devoted to the historic treatment
    of both preschool autistic children and the somewhat different, though also
    unsatisfactory, experience of school&#8209;age autistic children.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second basis on which the trial judge distinguished <i>Lovelace</i> is that in that case the exclusion of the claimant group was not associated
    with a misconception as to their actual needs, capacities and
    circumstances.  By contrast, here the
    trial judge found that the IEIP mistakenly assumed that the claimant group
    would have their needs met in school through the special education programs
    being offered.  The trial judge thus
    found that the <i>Lovelace</i> conclusion, namely that exclusion from a
    targeted ameliorative program is less likely to be discriminatory, does not
    apply here.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect, we read <i>Lovelace </i>differently.  That case involved an ameliorative program,
    the First Nations Fund, that targeted band aboriginal communities but excluded
    the claimant group, namely non-band aboriginal communities, who are clearly
    another disadvantaged group.  The Court
    concluded that the ameliorative purpose of the targeted program weighed against
    a finding that the exclusion of the claimant group constituted discrimination
    in part because that exclusion was not associated with a misconception about
    the actual needs, capacities and circumstances of the excluded group.  It said this at para. 87:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The First Nations Fund has,
    therefore, a purpose that is consistent with s. 15(1) of the <i>Charter</i> and
    the exclusion of the appellants does not undermine this purpose since it is not
    associated with a misconception as to their actual needs, capacities and
    circumstances. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the Court was speaking of the kind of
    misconception it described at para. 71, namely one that reflects stereotyping
    of the excluded group because it unfairly portrays them or tends to demean
    their human dignity.  If such a
    misconception is the basis for the exclusion, that would indeed undermine the
    purpose of s. 15(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.  A misunderstanding that does not demean their human dignity would not
    undermine that purpose.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the IEIP assumed that the needs of the claimant
    group would be met through appropriate special education programs.  The trial judge found that this was
    mistaken.  However, assuming the trial
    judge is correct, in our view that does not constitute a misconception as that
    notion was used in <i>Lovelace</i>.  It
    does not portray autistic children age six and over as not being disadvantaged
    or not having special needs.  It does
    not unfairly portray them as having traits that they do not possess, nor does
    it tend to demean their human dignity.  The mistaken premise therefore does not undermine the acknowledged
    ameliorative purpose of the IEIP, a purpose that is consistent with s. 15(1) of
    the <i>Charter</i>.  It is not the sort
    of misconception referred to in <i>Lovelace</i>,<i> </i>and it is not a basis
    for refusing to apply the <i>Lovelace</i> conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short, we do not agree with the trial judge that this case
    is different and therefore an exception to the <i>Lovelace</i> proposition that
    exclusion from a targeted program makes less likely the conclusion that the
    excluded group is thereby subjected to discrimination.  Rather we think that proposition applies in
    this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The final contextual factor from <i>Law</i> which may be
    relevant in appropriate cases in determining whether the differential treatment
    constitutes discrimination is the nature and scope of the interest affected by
    the state action. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here the trial judge found that the denial of an IEIP-type
    program to autistic children age six and over deprives them of the skills they
    need for full membership in the human community.  This is clearly an interest of fundamental importance.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Our reservation about this conclusion is akin to that of the
    Court in <i>Lovelace</i> where it found the adverse impact on the fundamental
    self-governing interests of the complainant group to be remote because of the
    careful tailoring of the ameliorative program to the different circumstances of
    the comparator group:  see <i>Lovelace</i> at para.&nbsp;89.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here as well, the IEIP is carefully targeted to the special
    capacities of the children in the comparator group to receive assistance, which
    is exemplified by the window of opportunity they present because of their
    younger age.  It is also tailored to
    their situation as preschoolers.  In
    both respects the claimant group is quite differently situated.  An IEIP-type program could not work for them
    as it does for the comparator group.  What may well be needed is something that will be a different but
    equally exemplary program for them, as the IEIP is for the comparator group
    because of its careful tailoring.  This
    would not be the IEIP but something that is tailored to meet the specific
    capacities and circumstances of autistic children age six and over.  However, that is not this complaint, which
    is about seeking to access the IEIP.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To summarize, the effect of this fourth contextual factor, the
    adverse impact of the denial of the IEIP on the claimants’ ability to acquire
    necessary life skills, must be seen as considerably muted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unlike the trial judge, we would therefore conclude that the
    claimants have failed to establish their claim of age discrimination.  Of the four contextual factors that inform
    this analysis, three point away from a finding of discrimination and one is of
    only muted impact.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Keeping in mind that these factors are informative, not part
    of a mathematical calculus, the important assessment is whether the exclusion
    of autistic children age six and over from the IEIP deprives or demeans their
    human dignity.  We do not think that the
    complainants have demonstrated such a denial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Viewed from the perspective of a reasonable person in
    circumstances similar to those of the claimants, this program must be seen as
    carefully targeted to ameliorate the disadvantage experienced by autistic
    children age two to five.  It is fully
    focussed on their particular capacities and circumstances and their unique
    potential to benefit from it.  Exclusion
    of the infant plaintiffs because of their age from a program so particularly
    designed to assist another disadvantaged group does not deny their human
    dignity or devalue their worth as members of Canadian society.</p>

    consistent with the IEIP Guidelines violated their guarantee of equality as it
    was a failure to provide “appropriate” educational services.  To appreciate how she reached that

    of these children.  These definitions
    are as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“exceptional pupil” means a

    meets the needs of the exceptional pupil;  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“special education services” means facilities and

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Minister shall ensure

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1) Subject to the approval of the Lieutenant Governor in Council, the
    Minister may make regulations in respect of schools or classes established

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In general, however, the Minister of Education does not
    directly provide education programs to students.  The limited exceptions are programs for children in correctional
    facilities, mental health centers, and Provincial and Demonstration Schools
    (which are residential schools for a limited number of those exceptional pupils
    who are deaf, blind or have severe learning disabilities).  This reflects the broad scheme of the Act
    which provides for a decentralized system of local school boards managed by
    elected trustees to administer the educational system at the operational level.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Act requires boards to ensure that their exceptional
    pupils get the special education programs and services they need, either by
    providing them directly or by contracting with other boards to do so.  Section 170(1)7 says this:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)<b> </b>Every board shall,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>7.<b>  </b> provide or enter into an agreement with
    another board to provide in accordance with the regulations special education

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 171(1)4 permits a board to hire the staff it needs and
    to authorize its principals to use volunteers as they see fit for duties
    approved by the board.  In virtually
    every case, the employment terms of board employees are set by collective
    agreements, which are binding the board as employer.  The Ministry has no power over school board staff.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In large part, the Minister interfaces with boards by passing
    regulations.  Regulation&nbsp;181/98
    requires boards to establish special education committees for the
    identification and placement of their exceptional pupils.  These are called Identification Placement
    and Review Committees (IPRC).  The
    boards are also required to develop an individual educational plan (IEP) for
    each student with special education needs.  </p>

    that the Act provides for identifying exceptional pupils are set out at para.
    340 of the trial judge’s reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1) The <i>behaviour</i> category includes students with a learning disorder that adversely affects
    educational performance and is accompanied by one or more criteria such as
    excessive fears or anxieties; (2) The <i>communications</i> category includes
    children with autism, those who are deaf and hard-of-hearing, those with
    language or speech impairments and those with a learning disability; (3) The <i>intellectual</i> category includes giftedness, mild intellectual disability and developmental
    disability and developmental disability manifested by a severe learning
    disorder in combination with other criteria; (4) The <i>physical</i> category
    includes children with such severe physical limitations as to require special
    assistance in learning situations and includes children with blind and low
    vision; and (5) The <i>Multiple</i> exceptionalities category which includes
    children with one or more of the above exceptionalities [emphasis in
    original].  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>b)            The Trial Judge’s Reasons</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From the beginning, the respondents’ argument has been that if
    the equality rights of school&#8209;age autistic children are to be respected,
    Ontario must ensure that they receive, as a special education program or service,
    intensive behavioural intervention consistent with that being provided in the
    IEIP.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge agreed with this and concluded her reasons for
    judgment with a declaration that Ontario’s failure to provide or fund such
    intervention violates the equality rights of the infant plaintiffs and also
    violates the <i>Education Act</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The infant plaintiffs are all school&#8209;age children with
    autism.  As the trial judge found, there
    can be no doubt that this claimant group is made up of “exceptional pupils” and
    hence entitled to the benefit of s. 8(3) of the Act.  She ultimately concluded that Ontario has denied them the
    entitlement they claim, in violation of the Act and their equality rights.  She found that Ontario did so by failing to
    ensure that they have available to them intensive behavioural intervention
    consistent with the IEIP Guidelines.  It
    did so not with the purpose of discriminating against them but with that
    effect.  As we read her reasons, the
    steps the trial judge took in reaching this conclusion are as follows.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, she accepted the evidence of Dr. Laredo-Marcovitz that
    the available research supports the conclusion that intensive behavioural
    intervention is the only scientifically supported and effective intervention
    for children with autism.  The trial
    judge also accepted her conclusion that the research shows that the therapy
    must be intensive (ideally thirty to forty hours per week) and based on the
    circumstances of the individual child; it should be started at the earliest
    possible age; and it should be delivered consistently throughout the calendar
    year.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the trial judge found that intensive behavioural
    intervention would continue to benefit autistic children who have reached the
    age of six.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the trial judge appears to have implicitly concluded that none of the other
    possible interventions, including those that are available for autistic pupils
    in the Ontario schools, are effective enough to constitute “appropriate”
    special education programs or services within s. 8(3) of the Act.  In other words, only intensive behavioural
    intervention as provided by the IEIP is “appropriate.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    the trial judge found that, although it had not done so formally in a
    memorandum, guide, or standard, the Ministry of Education had communicated a
    policy that intensive behavioural intervention would not be available in
    schools.  In other words, the Ministry
    had constructed what the trial judge called a “policy barrier” to the use of
    this intervention. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    steps led her to conclude that, contrary to s. 8(3) of the Act, the Minister
    has failed to ensure that autistic children of school age receive “appropriate”
    special education because they do not receive intensive behavioural
    intervention as provided in the IEIP.  She said this at para.&nbsp;486(h):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[I]n general, the children
    did not have access to “appropriate special education programs and special
    education services without payment of fees” because the Minister failed to
    develop policy and give direction to the school boards to ensure that ABA/IBI services
    are provided to children of compulsory school age.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then turned to the question of the proper comparator groups.  While she accepted typically developing
    children as an appropriate comparator group, she found that the respondents had
    failed to show that children with autism are denied a benefit compared to this
    proposed group.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
    also accepted two of the five categories of exceptional pupils as appropriate
    comparators, namely exceptional pupils in the communications category and exceptional
    pupils in the physical category.  The
    trial judge then appears to have concluded that these comparator groups do
    receive “appropriate” special education programs and services.  Although there is no express finding to this
    effect, it is required for the conclusion that the infant plaintiffs are
    subjected to differential treatment under s. 8(3) of the Act.  In other words the claimants do not receive
    “appropriate” special education while these comparator groups do.  The trial judge found that the ultimate
    consequence of this differential treatment is that children with autism do not
    have the opportunity to access learning that children in these comparator
    groups share.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge went on to apply the four contextual factors required by the
    discrimination analysis.  She ended her
    consideration of this claim, at para.&nbsp;739, as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I conclude that the claimant
    group of children with autism has established discrimination by showing that
    the distinction on the basis of the enumerated ground of disability denied
    their equal human worth and human dignity.  As indicated above, not all factors need to be established in order to
    conclude that discrimination has occurred.  Here, three of the four contextual factors have been established in
    favour of the claimants.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    declaration of the violation of the equality guarantee that concludes the
    reasons for judgment also includes reference to Ontario’s failure to provide
    speech therapy and occupational therapy to the infant plaintiffs.  The respondents described this in oral
    argument as a “parasitic” claim.  That
    is, if the infant plaintiffs had not been forced to leave the school system but
    had been able to remain because it offered them intensive behavioural
    intervention consistent with the IEIP, they would have received the benefit of
    the speech therapy and occupational therapy available in the school
    system.  The respondents seek only
    compensation for this denial, but acknowledge that this is dependent on the
    success of their claim for disability discrimination.  Given our dismissal of that claim, it is unnecessary to make any
    further reference to the declaration concerning speech and occupational
    therapy.  It must share the same fate as
    the disability discrimination claim.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>c)            Our Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    begin our analysis of the trial judge’s disposition of this claim with the
    question of the proper comparator group, because it informs everything that
    follows.  As indicated in <i>Hodge,
    supra</i>, each step in the s. 15(1) analysis must proceed on the basis of a
    comparison.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the claimants make the initial choice of those to whom they seek to be
    compared, the choice of the proper comparator is ultimately a matter for the
    court.  The comparison required is to a
    comparator group with whom the claimants share characteristics relevant to
    qualification for the benefit or burden in question, apart from the personal
    characteristic that is said to be the ground of the wrongful
    discrimination:  see <i>Hodge</i> at
    para.&nbsp;1. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here
    the benefit sought is intensive behavioural intervention consistent with the
    IEIP.  The claimants say that under s.
    8(3) of the Act, the Minister must ensure that this is made available to them
    as exceptional pupils because it is the “appropriate” special education program
    or service for them in light of their particular disability.  The essence of their claim as framed is that
    they have been wrongly left out of the statutory entitlement accorded by s.
    8(3).  They do not refer to or rely on
    any general statutory entitlement of all children, including typically
    developing children, to appropriate education programs and services from which
    they argue they are excluded.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    the claim is for “appropriate” special education to meet the needs of the
    infant plaintiffs, the personal characteristic that grounds the discrimination
    claim is the particular disability that characterizes the claimant group,
    namely, autism.  The characteristic
    relevant to qualification for the benefit that a proper comparator group must
    share with the claimants is that they are exceptional pupils (with disabilities
    other than the one that grounds the claim) and are therefore eligible to
    receive their own “appropriate” special education programs and services. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    light of the way this claim is framed, we therefore conclude that typically developing
    children must be rejected as the appropriate comparator group.  They do not share the characteristics
    relevant to the qualification for the benefit claimed because they are not
    exceptional pupils and therefore do not qualify for appropriate special
    education programs or services. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the other hand, the comparator groups chosen by the trial judge, namely
    exceptional pupils in the communications category, and exceptional pupils in
    the physical category, do share with the claimants the characteristic of being
    exceptional pupils.  Therefore, like the
    claimants, they are entitled to expect the Minister to ensure that they have
    available appropriate special education programs and services.  Section 8(3) of the <i>Education Act</i> requires this.  Thus, we agree that they
    are proper comparators for the purposes of the s. 15(1) analysis.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    challenge this presents in this case arises from the way the trial
    unfolded.  The evidence was concluded in
    July 2004.  In the written submissions
    filed in August 2004, the respondents put forward their disability
    discrimination claim based on a comparison with “other children in Ontario” or
    “nonautistic children”.  In doing so, it
    appears they were relying on the lower court decisions in <i>Auton (Guardian ad
    litem of) v. British Columbia (Attorney General)</i>, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 657.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 19, 2004, the Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal in <i>Auton</i> and reversed those decisions.  This
    significantly altered the landscape relied on by the claimants.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge invited counsel to re-attend in December for submissions in the
    light of this decision and related matters, and asked counsel for the
    plaintiffs to finalize the comparators on which they relied, bearing in mind
    the observations made by the Supreme Court.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Presumably
    because of how the case had been framed to that point, counsel for the
    plaintiffs acknowledged that the evidence had not dealt extensively with other
    special needs pupils.  As a result, in
    their written submissions to the trial judge on December 6, 2004, counsel for
    the plaintiffs made the following request: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If this Court agrees with
    the Supreme Court of Canada [in <i>Auton</i>] that a comparative approach to
    the analysis of s. 8 of the <i>Education Act</i> must include consideration of
    what is done in special education for children with other forms of disability
    then the plaintiffs hereby seek leave to introduce such evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    request was denied.  Instead, in January
    2005, the trial judge allowed the plaintiffs to make new written submissions
    restricted to the question of appropriate comparator groups.  In these submissions, counsel for the
    plaintiffs urged comparison with three possible comparator groups in addition
    to typically developing children.  These
    were children with severe learning disabilities, children within the
    behavioural exceptionality, and children who are deaf, blind, or deaf/blind.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, the trial judge decided upon the two comparator groups we have
    referred to.  Her description of those
    two groups is as follows at para.&nbsp;726:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[E]xceptional pupils in the
    communications category including those who are deaf and hard-of-hearing, those
    with language or speech impairments and those with a learning disability; and
    exceptional pupils in the physical category including children with blind and
    low vision. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the result of this chronology is that the evidentiary record addressing the
    circumstances of the two comparator groups is very limited.  This has important implications for the
    comparative approach that must be followed at each step of the s. 15(1)
    analysis.  To reiterate those steps, we
    quote from Chief Justice McLachlin’s majory judgment in <i>Gosselin, supra</i> at para.&nbsp;17:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>To establish a violation of
    s. 15(1), the claimant must establish on a civil standard of proof that: (1)
    the law imposes differential treatment between the claimant and others, in
    purpose or effect; (2) one or more enumerated or analogous grounds are the
    basis for the differential treatment; and (3) the law in question has a purpose
    or effect that is discriminatory in the sense that it denies human dignity or
    treats people as less worthy on one of the enumerated or analogous
    grounds.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first step in the s. 15(1) analysis is for the claimants to show the required
    differential treatment.  The claim here
    is that the Minister, acting under s. 8(3) of the Act, has accorded
    differential treatment to the claimants compared to the comparator groups.  It is asserted that by failing to provide
    the claimants with intensive behavioural intervention consistent with the IEIP
    Guidelines, the Minister has failed to ensure that they have available to them
    appropriate special education programs and services without payment of fee as
    required by s. 8(3).  The claimants say
    that, by contrast, the Minister has ensured that the comparator groups receive
    appropriate special education programs and services. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    these things are all properly established, the claimants will have demonstrated
    that they have been subjected to differential treatment and denied equal
    benefit of the law.  However, for
    several reasons we must conclude that they have not been established in this
    case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[122]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    it has not been demonstrated that the benefit claimed, namely intensive
    behavioural intervention consistent with IEIP Guidelines, could be delivered
    within the public school system as a special education program or service.  The respondents must demonstrate this to
    successfully establish that, because they do not receive the benefit claimed,
    the claimants have not received the appropriate special education to which they
    are entitled under s. 8(3) of the Act.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are a number of core elements of the IEIP that would not fit within the context
    of the public school system.  They would
    have to be changed for that to happen, with the consequence that if intensive
    behavioural intervention were to be delivered in that context, it could not be
    consistent with that provided in the IEIP.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    important element of the IEIP is that the intervention begin as early as
    possible after early identification or diagnosis.  The experts agree that this is essential.  However, this would have to be changed to
    provide that intervention continues when the child reaches school age.  Another is that the effective range of hours
    per week would have to be substantially reduced from the twenty to forty in the
    IEIP since, as the trial judge found, the school week is only twenty&#8209;five
    hours long, and no more than that could be provided and then only if the child
    did nothing else.  As well, the IEIP
    contemplates consistent delivery throughout the calendar year.  The trial judge found that the research
    shows this as being necessary if the program is to be effective, yet the school
    year runs only for ten months.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[125]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    IEIP Guidelines also contemplate the involvement of parents or caregivers
    directly in the child’s treatment, yet the Minister has no power to ensure that
    this would happen if intervention consistent with IEIP Guidelines was attempted
    within the public school system.  The
    power to permit volunteers to take on duties rests with the school principal,
    not the Minister, and then only within the strict confines of what is permitted
    by the governing collective agreement.  Finally, the presumption in the IEIP Guidelines is against integrated
    placements for the children until they have mastered particular skills.  The presumption in the education system is
    the reverse.  Regulation 181/98 provides
    that, in placing each child requiring special education, the IPEC will first consider
    placement in a regular class.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    are basic differences between what the IEIP Guidelines require and what the
    public school system can provide.  To
    this extent, the claimants cannot show that intensive behavioural intervention <u>consistent
    with</u> the IEIP Guidelines can be provided within the public school
    system.  When the Minister fails to
    provide or fund such intervention, he or she is therefore not failing to ensure
    that the claimants have available to them something that can be delivered
    within the public school system.  For
    this reason the Minister is not failing to comply with s. 8(3) of the Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[127]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    may be that, with changes, intensive behavioural intervention using a number of
    elements of the IEIP could be provided within the public school system.  However that possibility presents a moving
    target and would depart from both the benefit claimed and the trial judge’s
    order.  Precision is important if the
    comparative analysis required by s.&nbsp;15(1) is to be properly carried
    out.  It is the benefit as claimed and
    ordered that we must evaluate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[128]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Our
    second reason for finding that the respondents have not established the
    required differential treatment arises from the trial judge’s implicit finding
    that intensive behavioural intervention consistent with the IEIP is the <u>only</u> appropriate special education program or service for exceptional pupils with
    autism.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[129]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under
    s. 8(3), the Minister’s obligation is to ensure that appropriate special
    education programs and services are made available to exceptional pupils in
    Ontario.  This can entail an obligation
    to ensure that a group of exceptional pupils has available a particular special
    education program or a service only if it is the only appropriate program or
    service for that group.  If there are
    alternatives, the Minister is not required by that section to ensure the
    availability of any specific program.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[130]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that the Minister failed to live up to his or her
    obligation under s. 8(3) because he or she failed to provide or fund intensive
    behavioural intervention consistent with the IEIP.  This finding must entail a conclusion that there is no other
    appropriate special education program or service available for this group and
    that only the benefit claimed qualifies as an appropriate special education
    program or service.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[131]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, this conclusion is not sustainable given both the evidence and the
    other findings of the trial judge.  It
    represents a palpable and overriding error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[132]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was evidence of other interventions that are provided in Ontario to exceptional
    pupils with autism.  The trial judge
    acknowledged this fact but found that there was no expert or professional
    evidence that these other interventions are equally or more efficacious than
    the one claimed.  She also concluded at
    para. 534 of her reasons that in the absence of proper evaluations there are
    “many things we don’t know about children with autism in the public school
    system” including the “efficacy/outcomes of [the] various special education
    programs and services” that are made available to them.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[133]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    para.&nbsp;535, she then concluded as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the absence of such
    evaluation, I find that there is no evidence that the special education
    programs and services available to children with the exceptionality of autism
    provide an “appropriate” education. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[134]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
    went on in para.&nbsp;536 to say this:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Parents have no ability to
    collect data.  Government has that
    ability.  The data that has been
    provided is deficient.  Whenever data is
    relevant to my task, I intend to draw an inference against the government. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[135]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    move from the express finding that there is no evidence that existing available
    programs and services provide “appropriate” special education to the implicit
    finding that, in fact, they do not provide “appropriate” special education can
    only be explained on the basis that the trial judge drew an inference against Ontario
    on this point, since she had already made clear that because of the absence of
    evidence we do not know the efficacy of the available programs and services for
    autistic pupils. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[136]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, by proceeding in this fashion the trial judge effectively reversed
    the onus that rests on the claimants.  To establish differential treatment, they are required to show that,
    unlike the comparator groups, they have been denied “appropriate” special
    education programs and services because they did not receive the particular
    intervention claimed.  They can only do
    this if they show that the special education programs and services now
    available to them are not appropriate.  The trial judge effectively reversed this and required Ontario to
    establish that the programs and services that are made available to the
    claimants are indeed appropriate.  Because she reached her conclusion through the reversal of the proper
    onus of proof, the implicit finding that the claimed intervention is the only
    “appropriate” special education program or service for exceptional pupils with
    autism cannot stand. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[137]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    both these reasons we conclude that the respondents are not able to demonstrate
    the first part of the comparison necessary to show that the claimants have been
    subjected to differential treatment under s. 8(3) of the Act.  They have not established that the failure
    to provide intensive behavioural intervention consistent with the IEIP
    constitutes the Minister’s failure to ensure the availability of appropriate
    special education programs and services.  They have not shown that the intervention claimed can be provided within
    the public school system or that it is the only appropriate special education
    program or service for exceptional pupils with their particular disability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[138]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    the respondents have not shown that the Minister failed to comply with the
    obligation under s. 8(3), we need not decide whether the trial judge was
    correct in finding that the Minister’s conduct in setting up a “policy barrier”
    constituted a failure to “ensure” as that term is used in s. 8(3).  If the Minister’s conduct did not constitute
    a failure to ensure, this would simply be another reason why the finding that
    the Minister failed to accord the benefit of s. 8(3) to the claimants is in
    error.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[139]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    other part of the comparison inherent in the assertion of differential
    treatment advanced by the respondents is that, unlike the claimants, the
    comparator groups do receive the benefits to which they are entitled under s.
    8(3).  That is, the Minister ensures
    that they have available to them appropriate special education programs and
    services.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[140]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here
    the impoverished state of the evidence about the comparator groups and their
    experience with special education becomes starkly apparent.  At para.&nbsp;728, all that the trial judge
    is able to conclude about this is the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The common denominator for
    pupils in the communications category and the physical category of
    exceptionalities is the need for interventions that allow them to <i>access</i> learning.  The differences between
    children with autism and those in the communications category and physical
    category identified above are as follows.  First, some children who are deaf, blind and deaf/blind have access to
    Provincial and Demonstration Schools designed to identify and respond to their
    needs.  Even those who do not gain
    admission to the Provincial and Demonstration Schools have access to
    professionals who are specially trained to respond to the physical and
    communication impediments to their ability to <i>access</i> learning.  That is not to say that children with autism
    want or need Provincial or Demonstration Schools; they are not asking for a
    “one-size-fits-all” approach.  They want
    accommodations that are consistent with those afforded to other children in the
    comparator group.  Second, children with
    speech and language deficits who have been identified in the pre-school
    province wide program experience a seamless transition to schools.  For example, Ellerker spoke of the Toronto
    Preschool Speech and Language Services Transition to School Agreement that
    illustrates how the benefits of a pre-school program can be successfully
    continued into the school system.  Using
    PSSLP as a comparison, the claimants have been denied a seamless transition to
    school with respect to IBI/ABA [emphasis in original].  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[141]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    falls short of an express finding that the respondents have established that
    the exceptional pupils who make up the comparator groups do have available
    appropriate special education programs and services.  The trial judge’s findings speak almost entirely about only some
    pupils in the two comparator groups – some who gain access to Provincial and
    Demonstration schools and some others who receive a transition program to
    facilitate entry into the public school system.  The trial judge made no finding, nor could she have, that this is
    enough to constitute the appropriate special education programs and services
    needed by the exceptional pupils who make up the comparator groups as they make
    their way through the public school system.  Thus, if we treat this part of the differential treatment analysis as a
    fact that the respondents must establish, we must conclude that they have
    fallen short.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[142]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents urged in oral argument that we presume, as a matter of law, that
    the Minister ensures that appropriate special education programs and services
    are available to the exceptional pupils in the comparator groups because that
    is the legal obligation under s. 8(3) of the Act.  However, even if we were to do so, the respondents cannot
    demonstrate that they have been subjected to differential treatment under s.
    8(3).  This is so because, for the
    reasons we have given, they have not shown that the claimants are denied the
    appropriate special education programs and services to which they are entitled
    simply because they have not been provided with intensive behavioural
    intervention consistent with the IEIP Guidelines.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[143]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Our
    conclusion that the respondents have not demonstrated the differential
    treatment necessary to establish their disability discrimination claim is
    sufficient to dispose of that claim.  However, even if we had agreed with the trial judge that the respondents
    have shown that because of their particular disability the claimants are denied
    the appropriate special education program to which s. 8(3) entitles them while
    the comparator groups who have different disabilities are not so denied, the
    trial judge’s analysis of whether this would constitute discrimination cannot
    be sustained, given the state of the record.  There is simply not enough evidence to permit the contextual analysis
    comparing the situation of the claimants to that of the comparator groups in
    light of the factors described in <i>Law</i>.  Indeed, the trial judge’s finding of discrimination is not based on such
    an analysis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[144]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    even assuming differential treatment to have been demonstrated, we do not think
    that the trial judge’s discrimination analysis of the disability claim can be
    sustained.  There was so little evidence
    about the comparator groups that we do not think a proper analysis could be
    done, using the four contextual factors and applying the necessary comparative
    approach.  The respondents’ disability
    discrimination claim must therefore fail not only for want of a showing of differential
    treatment but for want of establishing that such differential treatment, if
    demonstrated, would constitute discrimination.</p>

    coming to our conclusion on the two equality claims, we have had the
    opportunity to review a great deal of the material assembled in this case and
    have heard detailed argument.  We are
    left with profound admiration and respect for the struggle of the infant
    plaintiffs and that of their families to manifest their children’s full
    potential.  However, where the
    requirements of s. 15(1) are not met, the <i>Charter</i> cannot guarantee
    success in such a struggle, nor can it require the state to provide whatever
    assistance is needed to achieve that success, as compelling as that may be on
    moral or policy grounds.  That remains
    the terrain of legislators.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[146]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rather,
    the law requires that the claimants demonstrate that the state has violated
    the equality guaranteed by s. 15(1) according to the jurisprudence that surrounds
    that concept. Regrettably, we must conclude that they have not done so, either
    for the claim of age discrimination or that of disability discrimination.
    The trial judge erred in deciding otherwise and we find that both claims
    must fail.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[147]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    finding that the IEIP violated the s. 15(1) rights of the infant plaintiffs on the
    basis of age, the trial judge considered whether the violation was justified
    under s. 1 of the <i>Charter</i>.  She
    first held that the IEIP was “prescribed by law”.  Thereafter, she applied the test from <i>R. v. Oakes</i>, [1986]
    1 S.C.R 103 at 138&#8209;40, under the terms of which Ontario had the
    opportunity to justify the IEIP by showing that:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'>(1) the objectives of
    the program are sufficiently pressing and substantial to override a
    constitutionally protected right; and </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'>(2) the means used (<i>i.e</i>.
    the age limit) are reasonably and demonstrably justified in proportion to the
    objectives.  This inquiry involves
    determining whether the means are rationally connected to the objectives,
    whether they impair the protected right as minimally as possible and whether
    the effects are proportional to the objectives.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[148]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that after October 2002, the objectives of the IEIP
    ceased to be pressing and substantial and the rational connection between age
    and eligibility ceased to exist.  Consequently, she held that the infringement of s. 15 was not justified
    under s. 1 of the <i>Charter</i>.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[149]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    in failing to find that the age cut-off in the IEIP was a reasonable limit
    under s. 1.  We will deal first with the
    respondents’ contention.  Thereafter, we
    will consider the trial judge’s conclusion in respect of s. 1, noting that an <i>Oakes </i>analysis is difficult as it is premised on an understanding that the
    impugned limit violates constitutional rights and freedoms, a premise that we
    have found does not apply.  That said,
    we will explain why we have concluded that the trial judge erred in finding
    that, after October 2002, the objectives of the IEIP ceased to be pressing and
    substantial, and the rational connection between age and eligibility ceased to
    exist.       </p>

    trial judge concluded that as the Minister of Community and Social Services
    acted under the authority of s. 7(1) of the <i>Child and Family Services Act</i> in exercising his discretion to establish the IEIP, the program was “prescribed
    by law” and the government was entitled to an opportunity to justify the age
    limit contained in the IEIP as a reasonable limit.</p>

    that the limit must be authorized by statute or regulation.  This is evident from the reasoning in <i>Slaight

    the employer to provide a letter of recommendation for him.  Although the order was held to constitute a

    decision by Dickson C.J., and a dissenting judgment by each of Lamer J. (as he
    then was) and Beetz J.  At pp.&nbsp;1079
    – 80, Lamer J. explained how to approach an order made by an administrative
    tribunal, saying:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It would be useful, in my view, to describe the
    steps that must be taken to determine the validity of an order made by an
    administrative tribunal, which are as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> First, there
    are two important principles that must be borne in mind:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>&#9472; an administrative tribunal may not exceed the
    jurisdiction it has by statute; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>&#9472; it must be presumed that legislation conferring an
    imprecise discretion does not confer the power to infringe the <i>Charter</i> unless that power is conferred expressly or by necessary implication.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The application of these
    two principles to the exercise of a discretion leads to one of the following
    situations:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1. The disputed order
    was made pursuant to legislation which confers, either expressly or by
    necessary implication, the power to infringe a protected right.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>&#9472; It is then necessary to subject the <u>legislation</u> to the test set out in s.&nbsp;1 by ascertaining whether it constitutes a
    reasonable limit that can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic
    society.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2. The legislation
    pursuant to which the administrative tribunal made the disputed order confers
    an imprecise discretion and does not confer, either expressly or by necessary
    implication, the power to limit the rights guaranteed by the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>&#9472; It is then necessary to subject the <u>order</u> made
    to the test set out in s.&nbsp;1 by ascertaining whether it constitutes a
    reasonable limit that can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic
    society;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>&#9472; if it is not thus justified, the administrative
    tribunal has necessarily exceeded its jurisdiction;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>&#9472; if it is thus justified, on the other had, then the
    administrative tribunal has acted within its jurisdiction [emphasis in
    original].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[154]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    the majority and Beetz J. expressly approved of this reasoning.  See <i>Slaight Communications </i>at pages
    1048 and 1058, respectively.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[155]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the Minister acted pursuant to the discretion conferred by s. 7(1)
    of the <i>Child and Family Services Act</i>, which reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='
page-break-after:
avoid'>7. (1) The Minister may,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)<b> </b>provide services and establish, operate and

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)<b> </b>make agreements with persons,

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[156]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    reasoning in <i>Slaight Communications</i> in respect of administrative
    tribunals, set out above, can be usefully applied to the exercise of the
    Minister’s power pursuant to s<i>. </i>7(1).  Section 7(1) confers an “imprecise discretion” on the Minister.  The legislation in question does not confer,
    either expressly or by necessary implication, the power on the Minister to
    limit <i>Charter</i> rights.  Thus, had
    we found that <i>Charter </i>rights had been infringed, it would have been
    necessary to subject the program (<i>i.e</i>. the IEIP) to the test set out in
    s. 1 by ascertaining whether it constitutes a reasonable limit that can be
    demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[157]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Much
    governmental action is undertaken by means other than statute or
    regulation.  The trial judge recognized
    the difficulties that would arise if the choice of instrument by which the
    government enacts such a program were to determine whether the governmental
    action can be justified under s. 1.  We
    agree with the reasoning of the trial judge at para.&nbsp;641 of the reasons in
    this regard:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is attractive to conclude
    that the <i>CFSA</i> does not expressly or by implication allow the Minister to
    exercise the discretion in a manner that infringes the <i>Charter</i> and hence
    s.&nbsp;1 is not engaged.  If that route
    were taken, however, it would lead to a disconnect between s.&nbsp;15(1) and
    s.&nbsp;15(2) broadly encompassing government action subject to <i>Charter</i> scrutiny on the one hand, and s.&nbsp;1 narrowly constraining the circumstances
    in which such government action can be justified on the other hand.  That dichotomy does not seem fair.  Furthermore, it would have the effect of
    forcing government to enshrine in legislation or regulation all programs where
    there might be an even remote prospect of a <i>Charter</i> violation in order
    to ensure access to a s.&nbsp;1 justification.  That would impede the ability of governments to respond to government
    priorities and would be inconsistent with a purposive approach.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[158]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s reasoning is consonant also with Supreme Court’s approach to the
    scrutiny of government action taken pursuant to wide discretionary powers.  In <i>Osborne v. Canada (Treasury Board)</i>,
    [1991] 2 S.C.R. 69 at para. 52, Sopinka J. writing for the majority, said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This Court has shown a
    reluctance to disentitle a law to s. 1 scrutiny on the basis of vagueness which
    results in the granting of wide discretionary powers.  Much of the activity of government is carried out under the aegis
    of laws which of necessity leave a broad discretion to government officials.  See <i>R. v. Jones</i>, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 284, <i>United States of America v. Cotroni</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1469, and <i>R. v.

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[159]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Minister’s authority to establish programs such as the IEIP is derived from s.
    7(1) of the <i>Child and Family Services Act</i>.  In creating the IEIP, the Minister exercised the discretion given

    called upon to draw a line marking where one set of claims legitimately begins
    and the other fades away without access to complete knowledge as to its precise
    location.  If the legislature has made a
    reasonable assessment as to where the line is most properly drawn, especially
    if that assessment involves weighing conflicting scientific evidence and allocating
    scarce resources on this basis, it is not for the court to second guess.  That would only be to substitute one
    estimate for another.</span></p>

    the law is premised on complex social-science evidence (about the effect of
    advertising, for example), where the law reconciles the interests of competing

    who are accessing the limited amount of available service, children who are
    waiting for service or children of school age, regardless of whether they have
    had the benefit of the IEIP.  In terms
    of attempts to reconcile the interests of these different groups, the record
    shows that consideration was given to a number of alternatives to the age limit
    as a mechanism for allocating available limited resources.  Proposals such as limiting the number of
    hours per week or limiting services to higher functioning children who are more
    likely to make the most improvement were rejected.  Determining the most appropriate means of allocating available
    limited resources came down to the weighing of conflicting scientific evidence

    resources, or the promulgation of solutions which concurrently balance benefits
    and costs for many different parties, then the proper course of judicial
    conduct is deference.  In <i>Irwin Toy,

    struck.  For the court to choose a
    different option than that selected by the legislature would be to replace one
    imprecise evaluation with another.  In
    such cases, greater deference is to be afforded the choice of the legislature
    because an evaluation of what constitutes “as little as possible” is impossible
    to determine and often based on complex and conflicting social evidence.  There are certain choices that the

    competing claims between groups, or evaluation of complex and conflicting

    405.  At paras.&nbsp;78&#8209;81 of <i>Mackin</i>,
    the Court explains the rationale for the rule:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[78]  According to a general rule of public law,
    absent conduct that is clearly wrong, in bad faith or an abuse of power, the
    courts will not award damages for the harm suffered as a result of the mere
    enactment or application of a law that is subsequently declared to be
    unconstitutional (<i>Welbridge Holdings Ltd. v. Greater Winnipe</i>g, [1971]
    S.C.R. 957; <i>Central Canada Potash Co. v. Government of Saskatchewan</i>,
    [1979] 1 S.C.R. 42).  In other words
    “[i]nvalidity of governmental action, without more, clearly should not be a
    basis for liability for harm caused by the action” (K. C. Davis, <i>Administrative
    Law Treatise</i> (1958), vol. 3, at p. 487).  In the legal sense, therefore, both public officials and legislative
    bodies enjoy <u>limited immunity</u> against actions in civil liability based
    on the fact that a legislative instrument is invalid.  With respect to the possibility that a legislative assembly will
    be held liable for enacting a statute that is subsequently declared
    unconstitutional, R. Dussault and L. Borgeat confirmed in their <i>Administrative
    Law: A Treatise</i> (2nd&nbsp;ed. 1990), vol. 5, at p.&nbsp;177, that:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>In our parliamentary system of government,
    Parliament or a legislature of a province cannot be held liable for anything it
    does in exercising its legislative powers.  The law is the source of duty, as much for citizens as for the
    Administration, and while a wrong and damaging failure to respect the law may
    for anyone raise a liability, it is hard to imagine that either Parliament or a
    legislature can as the lawmaker be held accountable for harm caused to an
    individual following the enactment of legislation.  [Footnotes omitted.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[79]  However, as I stated in <i>Guimond v. Quebec (Attorney General)</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    since the adoption of the <i>Charter</i>, a plaintiff is no longer restricted
    to an action in damages based on the general law of civil liability.  In theory, a plaintiff could seek
    compensatory and punitive damages by way of “appropriate and just” remedy under
    s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.  The
    limited immunity given to government is specifically a means of creating a
    balance between the protection of constitutional rights and the need for
    effective government.  In other words,
    this doctrine makes it possible to determine whether a remedy is appropriate
    and just in the circumstances.  Consequently, the reasons that inform the general principle of public
    law are also relevant in a <i>Charter</i> context.  Thus, the government and its representatives are required to
    exercise their powers in good faith and to respect the “established and
    indisputable” laws that define the constitutional rights of individuals.  However, if they act in good faith and
    without abusing their power under prevailing law and only subsequently are
    their acts found to be unconstitutional, they will not be liable.  Otherwise, the effectiveness and efficiency
    of government action would be excessively constrained.  Laws must be given their full force and
    effect as long as they are not declared invalid.  Thus it is only in the event of conduct that is clearly wrong, in
    bad faith or an abuse of power that damages may be awarded (<i>Crown Trust Co.
    v. The Queen in Right of Ontario</i> (1986), 26 D.L.R. (4th) 41 (Ont. Div.
    Ct.)).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[80]  Thus,
    it is against this backdrop that we must read the following comments made by
    Lamer C.J. in <i>Schachter</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 720:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>An individual remedy under s.&nbsp;24(1) of the <i>Charter</i> will rarely be available in conjunction with an action under
    s.&nbsp;52 of the <i>Constitution Act, 1982</i>. Ordinarily, where a provision
    is declared unconstitutional and immediately struck down pursuant to
    s.&nbsp;52, <u>that will be the end of the matter</u>. No retroactive
    s.&nbsp;24 remedy will be available. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[81]  In
    short, although it cannot be asserted that damages may never be obtained
    following a declaration of unconstitutionality, it is true that, as a rule, an
    action for damages brought under s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i> cannot be combined
    with an action for a declaration of invalidity based on s.&nbsp;52 of the <i>Constitution
    Act, 1982</i> [all emphasis in original].</p>

    see no principled basis on which to limit the application of this rule to cases

    unconstitutional.  Support for this view
    can be found in the above quoted passage from <i>Mackin</i>, in which the
    Supreme Court refers to the “exercise of their powers” and “government action”,
    rather than legislation <i>per se</i>.  Moreover, the reasons underlying the general prohibition against damages
    where declaratory relief is granted apply with equal force whether the
    declarations are made as a result of a challenge to legislation under
    s.&nbsp;52 of the <i>Constitution Act, 1982 </i>or, as in this case, where the

    first such reason is that where the government exercises discretionary
    statutory authority, the result of which is subsequently declared to be
    unconstitutional, the government does not owe a duty of care giving rise to
    liability.  See <i>Welbridge Holdings
    Ltd. v</i>. <i>Greater Winnipeg</i>, [1971] S.C.R. 957 at 968 – 69.  In <i>Hislop v. Canada (Attorney General)</i> (2004), [2005] 246 D.L.R. (4th) 644 at para.&nbsp;140 (Ont. C.A.), this Court

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In our view, the same result must follow in

    administration of a law that was valid throughout the relevant period of
    time.  There can be no civil liability
    at common law for this conduct: see <i>Guimond v. Quebec (Attorney General)</i>,

    second reason for restricting the availability of damages is the effect that
    the threat of liability for damages would have on government decision-making.  One of the primary functions of government
    is to advance society through the creation of new policies and programs.  Potential liability for damages creates the
    risk of interfering with effective governance by deterring governments from
    creating new policies and programs.  In <i>Guimond
    v. Quebec (Attorney General)</i>, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 347, after referring to the
    rule that damages are generally unavailable where a law is declared
    unconstitutional, the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed that this concern
    applies in the <i>Charter </i>context.  At para.&nbsp;15, the Court quoted from an article by M. L. Pilkington
    entitled “Monetary Redress for <i>Charter </i>Infringement” in R. J. Sharpe,
    ed., <i>Charter Litigation</i> (Toronto: Butterworths, 1987) 307 at 319&#8209;20:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A qualified immunity for government
    officials is a means of balancing the protection of constitutional rights
    against the needs of effective government, or, in other words, determining
    whether a remedy is appropriate and just in the circumstances.  A government official is obliged to exercise
    power in good faith and to comply with “settled, indisputable” law defining
    constitutional rights.  <u>However, if
    the official acts reasonably in the light of the current state of the law and
    it is only subsequently determined that the action was unconstitutional, there
    will be no liability.</u>  To hold the
    official liable in this latter situation might “deter his willingness to
    execute his office with the decisiveness and judgment required by the public
    good” [emphasis added by the Supreme Court].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[197]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    potentially vast scale of liability would interfere in another way with the
    proper functioning of government.  If
    the government were liable in damages to all persons affected by action
    subsequently declared to be constitutionally inadequate, large sums of public
    funds would be diverted from public programs and institutions to private
    individuals as redress for past acts of government.  This case illustrates this point in that the damages award
    creates an indefinite liability for Ontario to pay for privately purchased
    intensive behavioural intervention of the respondent families for so long as
    the private intensive behavioural intervention service providers consider it to
    be clinically required.  This cost rises
    exponentially if the same benefit were extended to other similarly situated
    families, a point discussed below. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[198]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This
    case illustrates two additional reasons that militate against the availability
    of damages in conjunction with declaratory relief.  The first is that assessing the loss attributable to the
    respondents involves speculation.  It is
    not known whether the government would have created the IEIP had it known that
    it would not be permitted to target the program towards pre-school children
    with autism.  </span>Ontario had to
    weigh multiple complex policy issues to establish the parameters of the IEIP,
    including the service capacity and budgetary resources available to the
    program, the choice of funding model and the prioritization of services or
    funding.  In light of these
    considerations, the court cannot assume that the other parameters of the
    program would have remained the same even if the age limit had been
    removed.  Therefore, i<span lang=EN-US>t cannot be assumed that the respondents would
    have received any funding after 2002 much less in the amounts ordered by the
    trial judge. </span><span lang=EN-US> </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[199]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This
    concern was recognized by the Supreme Court in <i>Schachter</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    a case in which the Court was called upon to consider the appropriate remedy
    for a constitutionally underinclusive benefit program that accorded benefits to
    adoptive parents but not to natural parents.  At pp.&nbsp;725&#8209;26, the Supreme Court held that damages were not
    an appropriate remedy under s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter </i>in cases where it
    cannot be assumed that the claimant would have benefited from a
    constitutionally valid program:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Further, this is not a case in which extending
    a remedy, for example damages, under s. 24(1) to the respondent would be
    appropriate.  The classic doctrine of
    damages is that the plaintiff is to be put in the position he or she would have
    occupied had there been no wrong.  In
    the present case, there are two possible positions the plaintiff could have
    been in had there been no wrong.  The
    plaintiff could have received the benefit equally with the original
    beneficiaries, or there could have been no benefit at all, for the plaintiff or
    the original beneficiaries.  The
    remedial choice under s. 24 thus rests on an assumption about which position
    the plaintiff would have been in.  However,
    I have already determined which assumption should be made in the analysis under
    s. 52, and have determined that it cannot be assumed that the legislature would
    have enacted the benefit to include the plaintiff.  Therefore, the plaintiff is in no worse position now than had
    there been no wrong.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[200]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Supreme Court held that it would not be appropriate to extend the benefit
    program to the natural parents.  At
    p.&nbsp;723, the Court recognized that it is not the function of the courts to
    make policy choices from a variety of constitutionally valid options:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Here, the excluded group sought to be inc</span>l<span
lang=EN-US>uded likely vastly outnumbers the
    group to whom the benefits were already extended.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Given
    the nature of the benefit and the size of the group to whom it is sought to be
    extended, to read in natural parents would in these circumstances constitute a
    substantial intrusion into the legislative domain.  This intrusion would be substantial enough to change potentially
    the nature of the scheme as a whole.  If
    this Court were to dictate that the same benefits conferred on adoptive parents
    under s.&nbsp;32 [the impugned provision] be extended to natural parents, the
    ensuing financial shake-up could mean that other benefits to other
    disadvantaged groups would have to be done away with to pay for the
    extension.  Parliament and the
    provincial legislatures are much better equipped to assess the whole picture in
    formulating solutions in cases such as these.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[201]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A
    further reason that militates against the availability of a damages remedy, as
    illustrated by this case, is the need for the government to act equitably.  Nothing in the record suggests that the
    respondents should be given priority over all other children with autism who
    are not before the court.  Providing a
    remedy of financial indemnification for past and future intensive behavioural
    intervention expenses to the respondent families, who may be no more in need
    than the thousands of families of children with autism in Ontario who are not
    parties to this litigation, creates an unfairness for autistic children age six
    or older who are not parties to this proceeding.</span></p>

    bad faith, abuse of power, negligence or willful blindness in respect of its
    constitutional obligations, damages are not available as a remedy in
    conjunction with a declaration of unconstitutionality.  As the trial judge made no such findings on
    the part of Ontario, it was an error in principle to award damages in
    conjunction with declaratory relief.  It
    was a further error to grant damages on the basis that the Minister of
    Education had breached his statutory duty under s.&nbsp;8(3) of the <i>Education

    such a breach would be to direct the Minister to fulfill his duty.  </span></p>

    dissenting reasons, that separated or divorced parents were an analogous
    ground, the claims of alleged discrimination depended on the parents’ own
    status of being separated or divorced.  With respect, we find it difficult to conceive of family status as
    constituting an analogous ground where the claim of the parents and

    already noted, the trial judge made a finding that neither the infant

    respondents appeal this finding.  Before
    turning to our analysis, we will briefly review the trial judge’s reasons
    relating to this issue.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>            a) The Trial Judge’s Reasons</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[209]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge framed the issue before her as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3 (a) Do the actions or
    inactions of the Minister of Education constitute a violation of the duty under
    s. 8(3) of the <i>Education Act</i> by failing or refusing to ensure that IBI
    (as described in the amended prayer for relief), speech therapy, occupational
    therapy and appropriate educational services are provided to children of
    compulsory school age, in a manner contrary to the infant and/or adult
    plaintiffs’ rights under section 7 of the <i>Charter</i>?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[210]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    7 of the <i>Charter </i>provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Everyone has the right to
    life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived
    thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[211]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    reviewing the parties’ positions, the trial judge concluded that the special
    education regime established under the <i>Education Act</i> does not violate
    the respondents’ s.&nbsp;7 <i>Charter</i> rights, primarily because those
    rights are not engaged.  She said at
    para. 755:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am not persuaded that the
    s. 7 rights to liberty and security of the person have been engaged for two
    reasons.  First, as counsel for the
    plaintiffs conceded, special education programs and services are a
    benefit.  I do not agree that a scheme
    that mandates participation in such a benefit could be perceived as “state
    coercion” even where the benefit is inappropriate and indeed, where it may be
    harmful.  Second, consistent with the
    majority in the Supreme Court in <i>Gosselin</i>,
    the failure on the part of the state to take action, such as the failure by the
    Ministry of the Education to develop policy and give direction to the school
    boards to ensure that IBI/ABA services are provided to children in schools, is
    in a different category and does not warrant a novel application of s. 7.  In the context of violating principles of
    fundamental justice, a positive state obligation to guarantee “appropriate
    special education programs and special-education services” is a far less
    intrusive category.  Therefore, I find
    that there has not been a violation of the infant or adult plaintiffs’ s. 7
    rights.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>            b) Our Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[212]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this Court, the respondents contend that their s. 7 rights are engaged in two
    ways.  First, they submit that the trial
    judge’s findings of fact demonstrate that because intensive behavioural
    intervention consistent with the IEIP Guidelines is the one program known to
    provide any hope to autistic children of becoming fully realized individuals,
    access to such programming is fundamental to the personhood and development of
    autistic children.  Accordingly, the
    special education regime in place under the <i>Education
    Act </i>adversely impacts the infant respondents’ liberty and security of the
    person interests by denying access to intensive behavioural intervention
    consistent with the IEIP Guidelines to school-age autistic children.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[213]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this regard, the respondents note that the liberty interest protected by s. 7
    is a broad concept intended to vindicate individual autonomy and personhood,
    and includes the right to make certain essential life decisions about oneself.  As stated by LaForest J. in <i>Godbout v.
    Longueuil (City)</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 844 at para. 66:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Rather, as I see it, the
    autonomy protected by the s. 7 right to liberty encompasses only those matters
    that can properly be characterized as fundamentally or inherently personal such
    that, by their very nature, they implicate basic choices going to the core of
    what it means to enjoy individual dignity and independence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[214]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    the right to security of the person extends to government conduct that places
    individuals at risk of serious mental suffering:  <i>R. v. Morgentaler</i>,<i> </i>[1988] 1 S.C.R. 30 at&nbsp;56; <i>Chaoulli
    v. Québec (Attorney General)</i>, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 791 at para. 116. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[215]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    support of their claim, the respondents rely, in particular, on the following
    findings of the trial judge at paras. 332-33:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I find that ABA/IBI is not
    emergent either for pre-school or for school-aged children.  It is nationally and internationally
    regarded as an effective intervention for children with autism.  There is consensus that the earlier it is
    commenced, the more effective it is likely to be.  Some of the experts were more optimistic about the extent to
    which positive outcomes can be achieved, while others were more conservative.  Without making a finding as to percentages,
    I find that most of the children who receive appropriate ABA/IBI will
    experience measurable gains (in the best outcome and moderate outcome
    categories) and few will see no measurable gains.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Some of the experts spoke of other interventions.…
    However, I received no expert or professional evidence that any other
    intervention available in Ontario is equally or more efficacious.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[216]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents contend that by denying school-age children access to intensive
    behavioural intervention consistent with the IEIP Guidelines, the appellant is
    depriving autistic children of any reasonable expectation of success in life
    and of any realistic possibility of meaningful participation in the
    community.  Moreover, for parents,
    having the ability to choose and provide the one program that will give their
    child a chance at success in life is central to the parent-child relationship.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[217]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are unable to accept the respondents’ submissions.  For reasons that we have already explained, in our view, the
    trial judge’s implicit conclusion that intensive behavioural intervention
    consistent with the IEIP Guidelines is the only program that qualifies as an
    appropriate special education program or service for school-age autistic
    children constitutes a palpable and overriding error.  Once this finding is set aside, there is no factual underpinning
    for the respondents’ claims.  In
    particular, without that finding, there is no basis for the respondents’ claim
    that access to intensive behavioural intervention consistent with the IEIP
    Guidelines is fundamental to the personhood and development of school-age
    autistic children.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[218]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    in our view, the existing jurisprudence does not permit us to interpret s. 7 of
    the <i>Charter</i> as imposing a constitutional obligation on the appellant to
    ensure that every school-age autistic child has access to specific educational
    services. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[219]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    acknowledge that the Supreme Court of Canada has left open the possibility that
    one day s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> may be interpreted as including positive
    obligations.  For example, see <i>Gosselin</i>, <i>supra</i> at para. 83, where McLachlin C.J., speaking for the majority,
    stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>With due respect for the
    views of my colleague Arbour J., I do not believe that there is sufficient
    evidence in this case to support the proposed interpretation of s. 7.  I leave open the possibility that a positive
    obligation to sustain life, liberty, or security of the person may be made out
    in special circumstances.  However, this
    is not such a case.  The impugned
    program contained compensatory “workfare” provisions and the evidence of actual
    hardship is wanting.  The frail platform
    provided by the facts of this case cannot support the weight of a positive
    state obligation of citizen support.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[220]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    to date, s. 7 has been interpreted only as restricting the state’s ability to <i>deprive</i> individuals of life, liberty or security of the person.  In this case, the appellant has chosen to
    provide the IEIP to children up to the age of six.  We have concluded that this choice, standing alone, does not
    create a constitutional obligation on the appellant to provide the same or
    similar programming on a more widespread basis.  Viewed in this context, the appellant’s actions in failing to
    provide intensive behavioural intervention consistent with the IEIP Guidelines
    to school-age children do not amount to <i>depriving</i> the respondents of a
    constitutionally protected right and therefore do not contravene s. 7 as it is
    now understood.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[221]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    cases on which the respondents rely do not assist them. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[222]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Chaoulli</i>, <i>supra</i>, involved a challenge to the provisions of a Quebec statute that
    prohibited residents from making private health insurance contracts.  The appellants in <i>Chaoulli </i>did not
    seek an order requiring the government to fund their private health care or to
    spend more money on health care, or an order that waiting times for treatment
    be reduced; on the contrary, they sought the right to spend their own money to
    obtain insurance to pay for private health care services. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[223]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
    comparable issue arises in this case, as there is no law restricting the
    respondents’ ability to spend their own money for intensive behavioural
    intervention services consistent with the IEIP Guidelines.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[224]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>New
    Brunswick (Minister of Health and Community Services) v. G.(J.)</i>, [1999] 3
    S.C.R. 46 and <i>R.B. v. Children's Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto</i>,
    [1995] 1 S.C.R. 315, arise in the context of child protection cases, where
    there is direct state interference in the parent-child relationship.  There is no such direct state interference
    in this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[225]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    in <i>Gosselin</i>,<i> supra</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada rejected an
    argument that s. 7 of the <i>Charter </i>requires the provision of a minimum
    level of social assistance adequate to meet basic needs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[226]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second way in which the respondents submit their s. 7 <i>Charter</i> rights are
    engaged involves a more traditional application of s. 7.  As we have already noted, the <i>Education
    Act</i> creates a scheme of compulsory education for children between the ages
    of six and sixteen years old.  The
    respondents contend that since the public school system is available free of
    charge, on a practical level, for most families with autistic children the
    compulsory education mandated by the <i>Education Act </i>must take place in
    the public school system. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[227]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They
    argue that because autistic children are excluded from the IEIP on their sixth
    birthday and because, on a practical level, they are obliged to enter a school
    system that the trial judge found was indifferent or hostile to intensive
    behavioural intervention consistent with the IEIP Guidelines.  Thus, the effect of the <i>Education Act</i> and the
    special education regime is to compel school-age autistic children to
    participate in special education programs that are at best useless and at worst
    harmful. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[228]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents contend that participation in such programs will inevitably cause
    profoundly negative impacts on the children's security of the person interests
    and on their parents' liberty interests.  Moreover, for parents, the inability to choose, or direct their child
    into the one form of programming that will assist their child, creates a level
    of stress that engages the parents’ liberty interests.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[229]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    begin by noting that s.&nbsp;21 of the <i>Education Act</i> does not create a
    mandatory requirement that school-age children attend public school; rather,
    under s.&nbsp;21(2) school-age children are excused from attending public
    school if “receiving satisfactory instruction at home or elsewhere.”  In <i>Adler v. Ontario</i> (1994), 19 O.R.
    (3d) 1 (C.A.), aff’d [1996] 3 S.C.R. 609, this Court held, at p. 12, that the <i>Education
    Act</i> does not compel attendance at a public school:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is quite clear that s. 21
    does not require the attendance of a child at a public school or a separate
    school under the jurisdiction of the appropriate board as defined by the
    Act.  Indeed, the section does not mandate
    the attendance of a child at any school.  Section 21(2) provides that a child is excused from attendance at a
    school (as defined by the statute) if the child is receiving satisfactory
    instruction at home or elsewhere…. Section 21 mandates compulsory education,
    but not compulsory school attendance at a non-denominational school.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[230]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    s. 21 of the <i>Education Act</i> does not compel the attendance of a child at
    a public school, we are unable to accept the proposition that economic
    realities dictate that school-age autistic children must attend public
    schools.  Even if parents are unable to
    afford private school education, home-schooling remains an option for parents
    who do not wish their children to attend public schools.  Given that s. 21 does not compel attendance
    at a public school, it cannot compel participation in programming that parents
    fear is harmful to their children. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[231]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless,
    based on the evidence adduced at trial of the cost of programming, we accept,
    as a matter of common sense, that many if not most parents of autistic children
    would be unable on their own to fund intensive behavioural intervention
    consistent with the IEIP Guidelines for their children.  However, we have already concluded that the
    appellant’s actions in failing to provide such programming to school-age children
    do not amount to <i>depriving</i> the respondents of a constitutionally
    protected right and therefore do not contravene s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> as
    it is now understood.  As the<i> Education Act</i> neither compels attendance at public school nor creates an
    impediment to parents educating their children at home or at a private school,
    we conclude that the s.&nbsp;7 rights of the respondents are not engaged</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[232]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    even if the <i>Education Act</i> did compel attendance in the public school
    system, once the trial judge’s implicit finding that intensive behavioural
    intervention consistent with the IEIP Guidelines is the only program that
    qualifies as appropriate special education program for autistic children is set
    aside, there is no factual underpinning for the respondents’ claims.  In particular, there is no basis for us to
    conclude that the <i>Education Act</i> and the special education regime
    adversely impact the respondents’ s. 7 <i>Charter</i> rights by compelling
    school-age autistic children to participate in special education programs that
    are useless or even harmful.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[233]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    conclusion, we agree with the trial judge that the respondents’ s.&nbsp;7 claim
    should be dismissed.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ISSUE SEVEN: THE NEGLIGENCE
    CLAIM OF THE DESKIN PLAINTIFFS</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>a)            The
    Trial Judge’s Reasons</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[234]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relation to the Deskin plaintiffs’ negligence claim, the trial judge found that
    Ontario does not have a private law duty of care to the Deskin plaintiffs.  In particular, she concluded that any duty
    that Ontario owes is owed to the public as a whole and not to specific
    individuals.  Further, the decisions not
    to extend the IEIP beyond the cut off age of five and not to provide intensive
    behavioural intervention consistent with the IEIP Guidelines in the special
    education system are policy decisions for which liability does not lie in tort.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[235]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also held that even if Ontario has a private law duty of care, the
    Deskin plaintiffs failed to establish that what damages they may have suffered
    were caused by a breach of that duty.  Finally, the trial judge said that, even if a negligence claim had been
    established, she would have been unable to assess damages because “the evidence
    did not distinguish between damages which arose as a result of having a child
    with autism and as a result of having a child with autism where the government
    had been negligent.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[236]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge therefore dismissed the Deskin plaintiffs’ negligence claim.  The Deskin plaintiffs cross-appeal from that
    order. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>b)            Our Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[237]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Michael
    Deskin was born on February 16, 1995.  When he was almost three years old, Michael was diagnosed with
    autism.  Shortly after he was diagnosed,
    Michael’s parents began a therapeutic program for him in their home.  Even before Michael’s formal diagnosis, Ms.
    Deskin, in particular, had already conducted extensive research relating to
    autism and its treatment.  As part of
    that process she assembled what came to be known as the “Deskin binder” in
    which she identified and described intensive behavioural intervention as the
    treatment of choice for autism. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[238]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ultimately,
    the Deskin binder and Ms.&nbsp;Deskin’s efforts at lobbying the government were
    a major catalyst in the creation of the IEIP.  As part of her efforts, Ms.&nbsp;Deskin also became a leader in
    establishing The Learning Centre to help children with autism, and was the
    Chair of its Board of Directors. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[239]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the IEIP was announced in September 2000, Michael was almost six years
    old.  However, because he qualified for
    the IEIP during his fifth year, he was eligible for a full year of services
    under the program.  Accordingly, through
    the Direct Funding Option of the IEIP, the Deskins received almost $50,000 in
    funding retroactive to July 1, 2000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[240]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    January 2001, the Deskins enrolled Michael at The Learning Centre, where he
    remained until April 2002.  IEIP funding
    for this program ended as of July 2001, and the Deskins themselves paid for
    Michael’s tuition at the centre during the balance of this period. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[241]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a founder of The Learning Centre, Ms.&nbsp;Deskin was unhappy when the Board of
    Directors set the tuition at $50,000 and then indicated during the winter of
    2001&#8209;2002 that fees would be raised to $55,000.  Since Michael was no longer eligible for IEIP funding, the family
    was unable to afford the increases.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[242]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to the trial judge, the winter of 2001&#8209;2002 was extremely stressful for
    the Deskin family.  By late March 2002,
    Ms.&nbsp;Deskin had concluded that the conflict between her and The Learning
    Centre was affecting Michael’s program and she therefore removed him from the
    program.  As noted by the trial judge,
    “[t]his unplanned transition had negative repercussions on Michael.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[243]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    April 2002, the Deskins made efforts to enrol Michael in the public school
    system.  Following an Identification and
    Placement Review Committee assessment, it was determined that Michael should be
    placed in a developmentally disabled classroom.  After visiting the classroom and speaking to the principal, the
    Deskins concluded that the classroom environment was not suitable for Michael
    and that, in any event, there were not sufficient supports in place to enable
    Michael to successfully transition to school.  Accordingly, the Deskins decided not to enrol Michael in the public
    school system, but rather, to continue with their home program.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[244]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    November 2003, the Deskins moved from Toronto to Dundas, Ontario.  Because Michael’s parents had already
    testified at trial, Michael’s grandparents provided evidence that this move
    occurred for financial reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[245]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to the Deskins, Michael experienced regressions in his progress during two time
    frames that are relevant to this proceeding.  The first regression occurred when he left The Learning Centre; Michael
    experienced a second regression when the family moved to Dundas.  The Deskins indicated that during the period
    immediately following each of these transitions, Michael lost skills he had
    acquired and had to spend time regaining those skills as a result.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[246]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Deskin plaintiffs do not challenge the trial judge’s finding that
    Ms.&nbsp;Deskin’s activities in lobbying the government did not give rise to a
    duty of care.  On appeal, however, the Deskin
    plaintiffs submit that, having made what was a true policy decision to provide
    intensive behavioural intervention in the manner described in the IEIP, Ontario
    had an obligation to implement that service in a non-negligent manner. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[247]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    that regard, they argue this case is analogous to other decisions recognizing
    that a duty of care arises on the part of government actors in favour of users
    of government services.  For example,
    see <i>Just v. British Columbia</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1228; <i>K.L.B. v. British Columbia</i>, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 403; and <i>Kamloops (City) v. Nielsen</i>, [1984] 2
    S.C.R. 2.  Accordingly, they say that
    the trial judge erred in failing to recognize that a duty of care arose because
    Michael was a user of the IEIP and the special education system.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[248]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    the Deskin plaintiffs claim that multiple operational failures occurred in
    implementing the IEIP.  Those failures
    can be grouped into three broad areas: (i)&nbsp;developing capacity; (ii) the
    transition to school, and (iii) monitoring and evaluation of the program.  Examples of failures in each broad area
    include the following:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>(i)            Developing

    significant capacity in the private sector that could have been used through
    the direct funding option; </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ontario did not contemplate a recruitment strategy

'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ontario failed to establish linkages with colleges and

  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>(ii)            The

    undertaken to assess efficiency and continuous quality improvement within the
    program and that data would be collected to provide the basis for an in-depth
    study of the outcomes for children and families.  The computer system designed to do such monitoring did not work;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ontario failed to conduct an external evaluation
    promptly as required by the Guidelines.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[249]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Deskin plaintiffs contend that although the trial judge made numerous findings
    concerning operational failures of the IEIP during the course of her reasons,
    when it came to the duty of care analysis, she erred in failing to make the
    distinction between what constituted policy decisions and what constituted
    operational decisions.  As a result of
    that error, the trial judge failed to recognize that Ontario had a private law
    duty of care to the Deskin plaintiffs in relation to the implementation of the
    IEIP, and that it was operational failures in the implementation of the IEIP
    that caused Michael, and therefore also his family, harm.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[250]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Deskin plaintiffs claim that their family has been impacted by government
    failures relating to the IEIP program and the special education system in three
    ways.  First, as the government failed
    to provide a smooth transition to the public school system and failed to
    provide appropriate special education in that system, the Deskins had no choice
    but to continue funding Michael’s home-based therapeutic program at their own
    expense.  Second, as a result of the
    government's failure to provide a smooth transition to the public school
    system, Michael experienced regression in the two time frames referred to
    above.  Third, as a result of having to
    continue to provide Michael with a home-based therapeutic program,
    Ms.&nbsp;Deskin was not able to spend time operating her business and therefore
    lost income.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[251]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are unable to accept the Deskin plaintiffs’ submissions for three reasons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[252]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    although they characterize their position on appeal as focusing on operational
    failures in implementing the IEIP, in our view, at the core of the Deskin
    plaintiffs’ claim is the assertion that Ontario failed to provide intensive
    behavioural intervention consistent with the IEIP Guidelines for autistic
    children as part of the transition to school and as part of the special
    education program.  Viewing the Deskin
    plaintiffs’ claim in this light, we agree with the trial judge’s conclusion
    that Ontario does not owe them a private law duty of care. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[253]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge recognized this essential feature of the Deskin plaintiffs’ claim
    in particular when dealing with the issue of whether policy reasons negate any
    duty of care that does exist.  At
    paras.&nbsp;844&#8209;45, she said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The initial decisions in
    April 1999 and August 1999 to limit eligibility in the IEIP to children 2 to 5
    and the subsequent decisions in June 2001 and October 2002 not to extend the
    age in the IEIP were policy for which the government ought not to be exposed to
    liability.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Minister did not develop policy and give
    direction to the school boards to ensure IBI/ABA services to children with
    autism.  That was a policy decision
    which is not actionable in tort.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[254]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Additionally,
    the Deskin plaintiffs have not linked the operational failures they rely on to
    the injuries they claim to have suffered.  Again, in our view, the explanation for this disconnect is the fact that
    the Deskin plaintiffs’ real complaint relates to Ontario’s failure to provide
    intensive behavioural intervention consistent with the IEIP Guidelines for
    autistic children as part of the transition to school and as part of the
    special education program and not, as they characterize it, a series of
    operational failures in the implementation of the IEIP.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[255]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    conclude that, rather than being a claim for operational failures in the
    implementation of a government program, the Deskin plaintiffs’ claim relates to
    government decision-making about the scope of the IEIP and the services to be
    provided within the special education system.  Viewed from that perspective, this case is not analogous to the cases on
    which the Deskin plaintiffs rely where a duty of care arose on the part of
    government actors in favour of users of government services. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[256]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the nature of the Deskin plaintiffs’ claim, we agree that the proper starting
    point for the analysis of whether a private law duty of care exists is to
    examine, as the trial judge did, the nature of any duties imposed under s.
    7(1)(a) of the <i>Child and Family Services
    Act </i>and s. 8(3) of the <i>Education Act</i>.  As already noted, s. 7(1)(a) of the <i>Child and Family Services Act</i> provided the Minister of Community
    and Social Services with the discretion to undertake the IEIP, whereas s. 8(3)
    of the <i>Education Act</i> sets out the scope of the Minister of Education’s duty
    in relation to special education programs and services. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[257]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the trial judge was correct in concluding that, to the extent each
    section creates duties, the duty created in each case is to the public as a
    whole, rather than to individual users of a program.  Both sections contemplate the allocation of public funds and the
    balancing of competing interests.  Moreover, because the decisions in issue involve government policy, a
    private law duty of care is negated under the second step of the <i>Anns </i>analysis: <i>Anns v. Merton London Borough Council</i>, [1978] A.C. 728 (H.L.).  See, for example, <i>Cooper v. Hobart</i>,  [2001] 3 S.C.R. 537; <i>Edwards v. Law
    Society of Upper Canada</i>, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 562.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[258]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    we see no error in the trial judge’s causation analysis.  The record indicates that Michael received
    all of the funds to which he was entitled under the IEIP.  After those funds were exhausted, Michael’s
    parents continued his enrolment at The Learning Centre.  After deciding to withdraw Michael from the
    Learning Centre, Michael’s parents did not enrol him in the public school
    system; nor did they appeal his Identification and Placement Review Committee
    Placement.  In these circumstances, we
    see no basis for concluding that any alleged operational failures in implementing
    the IEIP were the cause of any damages suffered by Michael or his parents. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[259]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    we agree with Ontario’s submissions that the Deskin plaintiffs have not linked
    the alleged operational failures on which they now seek to rely to the
    allegations of negligence that they pleaded at trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[260]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
