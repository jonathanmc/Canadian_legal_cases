  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Arial;'>On December 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9,
    2005, the Court of Appeal for Ontario heard an appeal from a successful
    constitutional challenge to Ontario’s failure to provide a program consistent
    with its </span><span style='font-family:Arial'>Intensive Education
    Intervention Program (IEIP) to autistic children age six and over. The panel of
    the Court of Appeal for Ontario consisted of Justices Stephen Goudge, Janet Simmons
    and Eileen Gillese.   </span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The
    IEIP is an intensive program offered by Ontario to children with autism,
    between the ages of two and five. The primary constitutional challenge claimed
    discrimination on the basis of age and disability. The Attorney General of
    Ontario brought the appeal, from the decision of Justice Kiteley, dated March
    30, 2005.  </span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Autism
    is a devastating paediatric disorder. It encompasses a spectrum of disorders
    characterized by pervasive difficulties in reciprocal social interaction, pervasive
    impairment in verbal and non-verbal interaction, and a pattern of restricted,
    repetitive, and unusual behaviours and interests. </span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The
    Ontario government undertook to design a program to assist children with
    autism. These efforts culminated in September 2000 with the release of the IEIP
    Guidelines and the commencement of IEIP services to autistic children age two
    to five.  </span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>IEIP
    is an intensive behavioural intervention service for autistic children. The
    Guidelines are based on expert evidence showing that intervention should begin
    as early as possible after identification or diagnosis, be intensive and
    directly delivered. To be effective, the intervention should range from twenty
    to forty hours per week, and typically last for one to two years. The intervention
    is to be delivered by well-trained staff who are monitored and evaluated by
    highly trained experts.  Ontario
    undertook a major training initiative to build capacity to deliver the IEIP,
    however, capacity was, and remains an issue. </span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The
    Court of Appeal unanimously allowed the appeal and held that the Ontario
    program was not discriminatory and did not contravene the <i>Charter</i> <i>of
    Rights and Freedoms</i>.</span></p>
  <h1 style='text-align:justify'><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>Issue One –
    The Age Discrimination Claim</span></b></h1>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The
    trial judge found that the IEIP was in many respects an exemplary program for
    autistic children age two to five.  She
    also found that for school age children, in comparison to children age two to
    five, there was only modest research about the efficacy of intensive intervention.
    However, she held that Ontario violated the equality rights of the infant
    plaintiffs on the basis of age because of the upper age limit of the IEIP.  </span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The
    Court of Appeal applied the equality law jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of
    Canada. The Court found that the claimants had been accorded differential
    treatment based on age, in that children with autism age six and older were
    denied the benefit of the IEIP, which children age two to five received.
    However, the Court found that the respondents had not established that this
    differential treatment constituted discrimination against them. </span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The
    Court found no doubt that all autistic children, regardless of age, have
    historically suffered significant prejudice and disadvantage as a result of
    their disability because of stereotyping and misconceptions about their human
    potential. However, the ground of discrimination in this case is age and the
    Court of Appeal found no evidence that autistic children age six and over have
    suffered historical disadvantage compared to younger autistic children as a
    result of stereotyping on the basis of their age. </span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The
    IEIP is an ameliorative program meant to focus limited resources on children
    age two to five. The situation of autistic children age two to five is
    different from those six and older. All the expert evidence emphasized the
    unique ‘window of opportunity’ that children age two to five present in being
    able to particularly benefit from an intensive intervention program.  As well, children over the age of six are in
    school and cannot undertake the twenty to forty hours a week that the IEIP
    entails, as younger children can. The IEIP was not designed for the needs,
    capacities and circumstances of the older group, but is specifically tailored
    to those age two to five. The Court of Appeal disagreed with the trial judge’s
    finding that this is one of those “rare occasions” where a targeted
    ameliorative program is discriminatory. </span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The
    Court found that this program must be seen as carefully targeted to ameliorate
    the disadvantage experienced by autistic children age two to five.  It is fully focused on their particular
    capacities and circumstances and their unique potential to benefit from it.
    Exclusion of the older autistic children because of their age from a program so
    particularly targeted and designed to assist the younger disadvantaged group
    does not deny the older children their human dignity or devalue their worth as
    members of Canadian society. </span></p>
  <h2 style='text-align:justify'>Issue Two – The Disability Discrimination Claim</h2>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The
    trial judge held that Ontario violated the claimants’ equality rights on the
    basis of disability in failing to provide a program consistent with the IEIP as
    the only special education program for school-aged autistic children that is
    appropriate.  </span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The
    Court of Appeal found that children with autism are properly compared to other
    exceptional children in the education system who have other disabilities.  However, for several reasons, the Court
    found that compared to those children, the claimants have not demonstrated that
    they have been subjected to differential treatment because they do not receive
    a special education program consistent with the IEIP.  </span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>In
    particular, it was not demonstrated that such a program could be delivered
    within the public school system because of the time and intensity it involves.  There was no evidence about how effective
    the existing programs for autistic children are, preventing the conclusion that
    an IEIP program is the only one that is effective. Nor was there sufficient
    evidence about the programs provided to students with other disabilities to
    permit the conclusion that they all receive proper special education
    programming and that autistic students were therefore differently treated
    because of their disability. Thus, the Court found that differential treatment
    and therefore the claim of discrimination based on disability was simply not
    established. </span></p>
  <h2 style='text-align:justify'>Issue Three – Section 1 of the Charter and the
    IEIP</h2>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The
    trial judge found that Ontario failed to demonstrate the age cut-off was a
    reasonable limit under s. 1 of the<i> Charter</i>. </span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Even
    though the Court of Appeal did not find the IEIP was discriminatory, it went on
    to find that the government had demonstrated that the age cut off was a
    reasonable limit under s. 1 of the <i>Charter</i>. </span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>First,
    the Court found the IEIP was “prescribed by law” because the IEIP was created
    by the Minister under the power given to him by the <i>Children and Family
    Services Act</i>.  Second, the Court
    held that IEIP was enacted for pressing and substantial objectives. </span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The
    IEIP is designed to ameliorate the disadvantage of young children with autism.
    It is premised on complex psychological and scientific evidence which
    establishes the importance of delivering intensive intervention to children
    with autism at early ages. The age limit in the IEIP reflects a balancing of
    the interests of younger children with those of older children as well as the
    need for government to allocate scarce resources where they will be most
    effective.  </span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Eliminating
    the age limit would lead to available resources being used for older children.
    Children in the targeted age group are already unable to obtain intensive
    behaviour intervention due to insufficient human resources. A further reduction
    in the available resources would defeat the important objective of providing
    services to those whom, all of the experts agree, will benefit the most. </span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The
    Court of Appeal found that when considering an allegedly under inclusive
    government program, the court must consider the tension of objectives and the
    various competing interests the government must reconcile when designing such a
    program.  As the Supreme Court has
    repeatedly held the proper allocation of limited resources is an important
    government objective that requires difficult policy choices, one, which the
    government is in a better position to make. The expert evidence and human
    resource shortage were reasonable bases on which Ontario could conclude that
    the age limit interfered as little as possible with the claimants’ equality
    rights.  The record shows Ontario
    considered a number of alternatives to the age limit as the mechanism for
    allocating limited resources. By distributing the available resources as
    broadly as possible among those children who can benefit the most, the salutary
    effects of the age limit outweighs its deleterious effects.  </span></p>
  <h2 style='text-align:justify'>Issue Four – Remedy</h2>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>In
    addition to making declarations, the trial judge ordered damages for the infant
    claimants to cover the cost of past and future intensive behavioural
    intervention for them. </span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>On
    appeal, the Court held that damages were an inappropriate remedy.  As a general rule, damages are not available
    when declaratory relief is provided. This applies equally where it is
    government action or a statute that is declared unconstitutional. </span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>It
    is impossible to assess the loss attributable to the claimants without
    speculation. It is not known whether the government would have created the IEIP
    had it been unable to target children with autism age two to five. It cannot be
    assumed the plaintiffs would have received any funding, much less in the
    amounts ordered.  Further, awarding
    damages to the plaintiffs effectively gives them priority over all other
    children with autism who are not before the court. This creates unfairness for
    autistic children age six and older who are not parties to this proceeding. </span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>There
    were no findings against Ontario of bad faith, abuse of power, negligence or
    wilful blindness in respect of constitutional obligations. Thus, damages were
    not available as a remedy in conjunction with a declaration of
    unconstitutionality. <i></i></span></p>
  <h2 style='text-align:justify'>Issue Five – The Adult Discrimination Claims</h2>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The
    trial judge dismissed the claims of the adult claimants, finding no
    discrimination in the provision of education benefits or health benefits. The
    trial judge found that the parents of children with autism (although not
    grandparents) constituted an analogous ground of family status.  However, she found the adult claimants
    failed to establish an appropriate comparator group.</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>On
    appeal, the Court found that the claims of the adult claimants were derivative
    from that of the infant claimants, and cannot stand in a better position that
    the infant plaintiffs. On that basis, the Court dismissed the claims. The Court
    disagreed with the trial judge’s finding that being a parent of a child with
    autism is an analogous ground. The Court found it difficult to conceive of
    family status as constituting an analogous ground where the claim of the
    parents and grandparents is based not on their own characteristics or identity
    but, rather, on the characteristics or identity of the infant respondents. </span></p>
  <h2 style='text-align:justify'>Issue Six - The Life, Liberty and Security of
    the Person Claims</h2>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The
    trial judge found that neither the infant plaintiffs nor the adult plaintiffs
    had shown that their rights to life, liberty and security of the person under
    s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> had been infringed by the special education regime
    provided by Ontario.</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The
    Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judge’s conclusion. In particular, since
    the evidence at trial did not permit a finding that the IEIP is the only
    effective program for autistic children, there is no factual basis for a
    conclusion that the IEIP is fundamental to the personhood and development of
    autistic children. Further, the Court found that existing jurisprudence does
    not permit them to interpret s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> as imposing a
    constitutional obligation on Ontario to ensure that every school-age autistic
    child has access to specific educational services. In addition, the Court noted
    that the <i>Education Act</i> does not create a mandatory requirement that
    school-age children attend public school. Finally, the Court concluded because
    the evidence at trial does not support the finding that the IEIP is the only
    effective program for autistic children, there is no factual basis for
    concluding that the <i>Education Act</i> and the special education regime
    compel the infant plaintiffs to participate in programming that their parents
    fear is harmful to them.</span></p>
  <h2 style='text-align:justify'>Issue Seven – The Negligence Claim</h2>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The
    trial judge found that Ontario does not owe a private law duty of care to the
    Deskin claimants. She also found that the decision not to extend the IEIP
    beyond the cut off age of five and not to provide intensive behavioural
    intervention consistent with the IEIP Guidelines in the special education
    system are policy decisions for which liability does not lie in tort. She
    therefore dismissed the Deskin claimants’ negligence claims.</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The
    Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judge’s conclusions. The Court found that
    at its core, the Deskin claimants’ claim in negligence is that Ontario failed
    to provide intensive behavioural intervention consistent with the IEIP
    Guidelines for autistic children as part of the transition to school and as
    part of the special education regime. The Court agreed with the trial judge
    that this type of policy decision does not give rise to a private law duty of
    care. To the extent that s. 7(1)(a) of the <i>Child and Family Services Act</i> and s. 8(3) of the <i>Education Act</i> create duties, the duty created is to
    the public as a whole rather than to individual users of specific programs.</span></p>
  <h2 style='text-align:justify'>Disposition</h2>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>The Court allowed
    Ontario’s appeal, and dismissed the cross-appeal of the Wynbergs and Deskins.</p>
