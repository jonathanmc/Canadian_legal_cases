    importance to them.  On November 21,
    2001, an incident occurred that offended their sense of sanctity in the purity
    of their home, and shattered Mr. Mustapha’s life.  In the course of replacing an empty bottle of
    Culligan water on the dispenser provided by Culligan, he and his wife saw a
    dead fly, and part of another dead fly, in the fresh, unopened, replacement
    bottle.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither Mr. Mustapha nor any member of his family drank
    from the bottle.  He became obsessed,
    however, with thoughts about the dead fly in the water and about the potential
    implications for his family’s health of their having possibly been drinking
    unpurified water supplied in the past.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge accepted the medical evidence that Mr.
    Mustapha suffers from a major depressive disorder, with associated phobia and
    anxiety – all triggered by the fly-in-the-bottle incident.  In the result, Mr. Mustapha recovered
    judgment at trial in the total amount of $341,775, plus pre-judgment interest,
    for psychiatric injuries suffered because of the incident.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Mustapha emigrated from
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Lebanon</st1:country-region>
    to
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    in 1976 at the age of sixteen.  After
    schooling and training as a hair stylist, he opened a business as Martin’s
    Coiffure in 1986.  By all accounts the
    business did well, expanding ultimately to two outlets – one in the Radisson
    Hotel in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Windsor,
    and a second at Casino Windsor.  He
    married Mrs. Mustapha in 1984.  They have
    two daughters, Amanda and Martina, aged seven and three at the time of
    trial.  Mrs. Mustapha was seven-months
    pregnant with Martina when the fly-in-the-bottle incident occurred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Mustaphas had been using bottled Culligan water for
    personal consumption in their home since a Culligan representative persuaded
    Mr. Mustapha to adopt its use at his hair salon shortly after it opened in
    1986.  Based on Culligan’s
    representations about the purity and healthy quality of Culligan water,
    including how it would benefit pregnant women and children, and how much better
    it was for someone than city water, Mr. Mustapha installed Culligan dispensers
    both in his salon and at home.  He and
    his family used nothing but bottled Culligan water for consumption
    thereafter.  Culligan regularly delivered
    jugs of water to their home and picked up the empty jugs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On November 21, 2001, Mr. Mustapha was replacing the
    bottle in the home dispenser at his wife’s request.  They were both present.  As she always did, Mrs. Mustapha washed the
    neck of the new bottle to ensure there were no germs on the outside of it
    before the bottle was placed on the dispenser.  As she was doing so, Mr. Mustapha observed something dark in the
    bottle.  On closer examination, they both
    realized that what they were looking at was a dead fly.  Mrs. Mustapha vomited immediately and
    afterwards held her stomach and complained of cramps and pain.  Although Mr. Mustapha felt nauseous, he did
    not vomit at the time (he did so later).  He also felt abdominal pain.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both Mr. and Mrs. Mustapha experienced ill effects as a
    result of this incident.  The trial judge
    dismissed Mrs. Mustapha’s claim because he was not satisfied that her reaction
    rose to the level of nervous shock or psychiatric illness sufficient to found a
    claim in negligence.  He found, however,
    that Mr. Mustapha – unlike his wife – became afflicted with a “recognizable
    psychological injury” as a result of the incident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence established that Mr. Mustapha could not
    get the fly in the bottle out of his mind in the aftermath of the
    incident.  He became anxious over the
    possible effects on his family of drinking water that he no longer trusted to
    have been pure.  Indeed, he became
    obsessed, believing that his health and that of his family had been compromised
    and that his trust in Culligan water had been betrayed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge succinctly summarized the effects of
    the incident on Mr. Mustapha at paras. 8 and 194 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>He pictures flies
    walking on animal feces or rotten food and then being in his supposedly pure
    water.  The worst thought was that his
    wife would carefully sterilize a bottle, for the health and safety of his baby
    daughter but then would put into that bottle, formula made with Culligan water.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Mr. Mustapha’s
    self description is that he could not get the fly in the bottle out of his
    mind, he had nightmares, he was only sleeping four hours or so a night, he has
    been unable to drink water since the incident, he has lost his sense of humour
    and instead become argumentative and edgy, he has been constipated, is bothered
    by revolting mental images of flies on feces etc., can no longer take long and
    enjoyable showers and instead, after lengthy treatment, can only take
    perfunctory showers with his head down so the water does not strike his
    face.  It took lengthy treatment before
    he could drink coffee made with water.  He has to take a variety of medications which he says leave him feeling
    that he is not in full control and draggy.  He can’t get up and get off to work in the mornings as he always used
    to.  He has lost clients because of the
    changes in his personality and mood and also because of the reduction in his
    previous skills as a hairstylist.  He has
    lost interest in, and ability to perform sexually.  He had initial complaints of nausea and
    present complaints of constant, unexplained abdominal pain or discomfort.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge accepted Mr. Mustapha’s evidence.  In addition, the expert medical testimony
    amply supports his finding that Mr. Mustapha developed a
    psychiatric/psychological illness – often referred to in legal parlance as
    “nervous shock”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> –
    sufficient to support a claim in negligence, namely a major depressive
    disorder, with associated phobia and anxiety.  Culligan does not contest the finding that the fly-in-the-bottle
    incident was a contributing cause of Mr. Mustapha’s resulting illness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also concluded that the psychiatric
    effect of the fly-in-the-bottle incident was due to Mr. Mustapha’s particular
    sensibilities to such an event.  Acknowledging that Mr. Mustapha’s reaction was
    “objectively bizarre”, the trial judge found that his background in the Middle
    East, “where the devotion to and concern for the family is at a higher level
    than is found in North America,” combined with “the higher level of cleanliness
    and avoidance of insects practised by this family than is usual”, predisposed
    the respondent to react as he did.  At
    para. 227 of his reasons he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>Here, the resulting
    problems for Mr. Mustapha were unexpectedly severe, but in my view that was <i>because of his previous history and the
    particular circumstances of this case</i>.  Because of cultural factors, he had an unusually high concern over the
    health and well being of his family.  His
    wife maintained an unusually clean home, and was concerned about their health
    and the health of their children.  He and
    his wife had planned a pregnancy, even though he knew their previous child was
    born prematurely, and that Mrs. Mustapha had reached an age where there was
    some concern over this pregnancy.  In
    fact, the doctor had warned of high risk shortly before this incident.  <i>All of
    these factors contributed to his obsessive thinking after seeing the fly, which
    progressed to the state diagnosed by his various experts</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge made no reference to any evidence that
    Culligan was aware, or should have been aware, of any of these particular
    proclivities on the part of Mr. Mustapha.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='
text-align:left'>THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On behalf of the appellant, Mr. David submits that,
    although the trial judge may have properly articulated the foreseeability test
    as set out in <i>Vanek v. Great Atlantic
    &amp; Pacific Co. of Canada</i> (1999), 48 O.R. (3d) 228 (C.A.), leave to appeal refused [2000] S.C.C.A. No.
    50, he failed to apply it correctly because he did not take into account
    the objective requirement that the consequences of the tortfeasor’s conduct
    must be reasonably foreseeable in a person of “reasonable fortitude and
    robustness”.  He argues that the trial
    judge never considered the objective question whether such a person would have
    sustained a recognizable psychiatric illness as a result of seeing a dead fly
    in a bottle of water from which no one had consumed anything.  Mr. David also contends that the trial judge
    erred in basing his finding of liability on the foreseeable “possibility” – as
    opposed to a foreseeable “probability” – of damage, contrary to the established
    jurisprudence.  Finally, he attacks the
    damages awarded by the trial judge as being inordinately high.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In response, Mr. Pape argues that the objective
    component of the reasonable foreseeability test does not apply in the
    circumstances of this case because Mr. Mustapha is not a secondary victim or
    bystander.  He submits that the English
    approach should apply and that foreseeability of nervous shock or psychiatric
    harm is not necessary where the plaintiff suffers those consequences directly
    from the conduct of the tortfeasor.  In
    any event, he asserts that the trial judge correctly applied the <i>Vanek</i> test to the facts of the case,
    finding first that it was reasonably foreseeable that some degree of
    psychiatric harm would result and, secondly, that the psychiatric damage
    actually sustained resulted in a recognizable psychiatric illness.  Mr. Pape says that the appellant’s argument
    based on “possibility” versus “probability” is untenable and conflates
    probability of risk with magnitude of risk.  Finally, he points out that Mr. Mustapha’s claim is made in contract as
    well as in tort, and that damages for mental distress and nervous shock were
    reasonably foreseeable consequences – within the contemplation of the parties
    at the time of the contract – of the delivery of contaminated water to the
    Mustaphas.  He supports the damages
    awarded by the trial judge.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s conclusions with respect to liability
    and damages were summarized in para. 240, the penultimate paragraph of his
    reasons, as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>For
    all of the foregoing reasons, I dismiss the claim of Mrs. Mustapha.  I find that Mr. Mustapha has suffered a
    recognizable psychological injury as a result of seeing the fly in the Culligan
    bottle, that the bottle was contaminated during the bottling process, and
    before sealing at the company’s premises, that it continued to be sealed until
    and after the viewing of the fly by Mr. and Mrs. Mustapha, that the
    contamination of Culligan water bottles by flies was known to be possible, that
    the occurrence of this type of contamination was a breach of a duty of care
    imposed by statute and the common law on the producers of products like
    drinking water, <i>that the possibility of
    damage, including psychological damage occurring as a result of such
    contamination was foreseeable in all of the circumstances, and that accordingly
    Mr. Mustapha was entitled to damages</i>, which damages are assessed as general
    damages of $80,000, past and future special damages of $24,174.58, and past and
    future economic damages of $237,600.  The
    claim for aggravated damages is denied. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>            A.  Liability in
    Tort</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the findings made by the trial judge, it is apparent
    that Mr. Mustapha suffered significant and lingering psychiatric injury as a
    result of the fly-in-the-bottle incident.  Nothing I say in these reasons is intended to minimize or belittle the
    difficulties he has experienced.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also found, however, that “[t]he
    reaction of Mr. Mustapha to seeing a dead fly, and part of another, in a bottle
    of Culligan water was certainly, <i>and
    objectively</i> bizarre.” [Emphasis added.]  He concluded that this reaction, and the psychiatric injuries the appellant
    sustained, were a function of Mr. Mustapha’s specific cultural background and
    personal sensibilities, and the particular circumstances of this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue of tort law raised on this appeal is whether
    a defendant may be liable for damages for psychiatric harm where the harm, by
    any objective measurement, consists of an exaggerated reaction by an obsessive
    person of particular sensibilities to what, in reality, is a relatively minor
    or trivial incident – the sight of a dead fly in a bottle of consumer
    water.  In my view, the answer to this
    question is no.</p>

    Evolution of Liability for Psychiatric Injury</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The common law with respect to liability in tort for
    nervous shock or psychiatric harm has evolved over the past century.  Initially, psychiatric injury was considered
    too remote, and therefore noncompensable, unless accompanied by physical injury
    or impact inflicted on the plaintiff: see <i>Victorian
    Railways Commissioners v. Coultas</i> (1888), 13 App. Cas. 222 (P.C.); <i>Toronto Railway Co. v. Toms</i> (1911), 44
    S.C.R. 268; Allen M. Linden, <i>Canadian
    Tort Law</i>, 7<span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New Roman"'>th</span> ed. (
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Markham:
    Butterworths, 2001).  In the breakthrough
    decision of <i>Dulieu v. White &amp; Sons</i>, [1901] 2 K.B. 669 (K.B.), damages
    for nervous shock were awarded for psychiatric injury arising out of an immediate
    fear of personal injury to the plaintiff, despite the absence of any physical
    injury or impact on the plaintiff.  Subsequently, the law has developed to permit recovery for psychiatric
    injury caused out of fear for the safety of someone else – usually a spouse,
    child or a person with a close relationship to the plaintiff – resulting from
    witnessing an accident or its immediate aftermath: see <i>McLoughlin v. O’Brian</i>, [1983] 1 A.C. 410 (H.L.); <i>Duwyn v.
    Kaprielian</i> (1978), 22 O.R. (2d) 736 (C.A.); <i>Bechard v. Haliburton Estate</i> (1991), 5 O.R. (3d) 512 (C.A.); <i>Nespolon v. Alford</i> (1998), 40 O.R. (3d)

    divided the types of cases in which damages may be recovered for nervous shock
    or psychiatric injury into two broad categories: “those cases in which the
    injured plaintiff was involved, either mediately or immediately, as a
    participant, and those in which the plaintiff was no more than the passive and unwilling
    witness of injury caused to others”: <i>Alcock
    v. Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police</i>, [1992] 1 A.C. 310 at 407
    (H.L.), <i>per</i> Lord Oliver.  The former type of case is referred to as a
    “primary victim” case, whereas the latter is known as a “secondary victim” or
    “bystander” case.  </p>

    and is important for the different test of foreseeability that applies,
    depending upon the category in which the plaintiff’s case is found to fall.  In <i>Page</i>,
    the House of Lords held that in primary victim cases a plaintiff seeking
    damages for psychiatric harm need only establish reasonable foreseeability of <i>physical</i> injury in order to recover;
    reasonably foreseeable psychiatric injury of some form is not necessary in such
    situations, even where there has been no actual physical harm.  In secondary victim or bystander cases, on
    the other hand, a plaintiff seeking damages for psychiatric harm must show that
    some form of psychiatric illness in a person of normal fortitude was reasonably
    foreseeable before being entitled to recover.</p>

    and amongst academics, about whether the basis for liability for psychiatric
    harm is found in the notion of reasonable foreseeability by itself, or whether
    – for policy reasons – foreseeability alone is insufficient and must be
    accompanied by certain control mechanisms.  See for example, the conflicting opinions in <i>McLoughlin</i>, <i>supra</i> (Lord Bridge and Lord Scarman
    arguing for the principled position of reasonable foreseeability alone; Lord
    Wilberforce and Lord Edmund-Davies holding that there is a need for public
    policy limitations on liability in addition to the reasonable foreseeability
    requirement; Lord Russell favouring the latter position but finding it was
    unnecessary to decide in the circumstances of the case).  See also the discussions in Louise

    the day. <i>White</i> confirmed that in
    addition to reasonable foreseeability of psychiatric injury in a person of
    normal fortitude, it was necessary for a plaintiff seeking damages for
    psychiatric illness to establish a relationship of proximity between the
    plaintiff and defendant.  The House of
    Lords acknowledged that the requirement of proximity was a “control mechanism”
    designed to limit the ambit of the remedy in such cases.  Where the plaintiff was personally involved
    in the incident – a primary victim case – the majority said, proximity is
    easily demonstrated.  Where psychiatric
    injury is caused out of fear for the safety of someone else, however – a
    “bystander” case – foreseeability of injury by shock is insufficient.  Rather, the law in the United Kingdom
    requires the following proximity indicators – factors intended to control the
    spectre of indeterminate liability in tort – be satisfied: (i) close ties of
    love and affection must exist between the plaintiff and the victim (called
    “relational proximity”); (ii) the plaintiff must have been present at the
    accident or its immediate aftermath (called “locational proximity”); and (iii)
    the psychiatric injury must have been caused by direct perception of the
    accident or its immediate aftermath, and not after hearing about it from
    someone else (called “temporal proximity”).<a

    general law respecting liability in cases of psychiatric harm in the following
    fashion:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In
    Canadian law, a plaintiff can recover for the negligent infliction of
    psychiatric damage if he or she establishes two propositions – first, that the
    psychiatric damage suffered was a foreseeable consequence of the negligent
    conduct; second, that the psychiatric damage was so serious that it resulted in
    a recognizable psychiatric illness:  see
    Linden, <i>Canadian Tort Law, supra</i>, at
    pp. 389-92.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Foreseeable consequences, however, as noted in <i>Vanek </i>at para. 45, are consequences that the “event and its aftermath might
    engender <i>in the reasonable person</i>.” [Emphasis in original.]  At para. 58, MacPherson J.A. adopted the
    following passage from the speech of Lord Griffiths in <i>White,</i> <i>supra</i>, at pp. 462-463, as “a particularly succinct
    and useful statement on the foreseeability issue in this type of case”:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>There is a further
    requirement in the bystander case and that is that psychiatric injury was
    reasonably foreseeable as a likely consequence of exposure to the trauma of the
    accident or its immediate aftermath.  <i>The law expects reasonable fortitude and
    robustness of its citizens and will not impose liability for the exceptional
    frailty of certain individuals</i>.  This
    is not to be confused with the “eggshell skull” situation, where as a result of
    a breach of duty the damage inflicted proves to be more serious than
    expected.  It is a threshold test of
    breach of duty; before a defendant will be held in breach of duty to a
    bystander he must have exposed them to a situation in which it is reasonably
    foreseeable that a person of reasonable robustness and fortitude would be
    likely to suffer psychiatric injury. [Emphasis added.]</p>

    close to the case at bar in a factual sense, although it is clearly a
    “bystander” case.  Mr. and Mrs. Vanek’s
    eleven-year old child drank a small amount from a juice bottle containing toxic
    fluids at school.  She noticed the drink
    had a foul taste and regurgitated some of it, although she did not vomit or
    lose consciousness.  The parents were
    called to the school, and took the child to the hospital.  At the hospital, the child was examined and
    the parents were assured that she had not been poisoned and would suffer no
    long-term effects.  The parents
    subsequently received the same assurances from different government and health
    authorities.  The child showed no further
    symptoms from the incident and returned to her normal life.  The parents, however, became obsessed with
    the possibility that the child might suffer harm in the future.  They sued the distributor of the drink and
    its manufacturer.  At trial, they
    recovered moderate damages for anxiety and distress.</p>

line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The judgment was reversed on appeal.  Writing for the Court, MacPherson J.A.
    concluded that the parents’ reaction to what was, in effect, a minor mishap of
    the type that frequently occurs in schools and in family life, was not that of
    an average concerned parent.  He further
    found that the defendants could not have reasonably foreseen the parents’
    highly unusual reaction and the psychiatric damages engendered by it.  After noting the passage from the speech of
    Lord Griffiths in <i>White</i>, cited above,
    and observing that the actual event witnessed by the Vaneks was neither
    “distressing in the extreme” (<i>McLoughlin,
    supra</i>) nor “horrifying or gruesome” (<i>Haliburton
    Estate, supra</i>) – the same may be said in the case at bar – MacPherson J.A.
    determined as follows at para. 60:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In
    conclusion, the juice incident on June 16, 1993 was the type of incident that
    happens, in schools and in family life, every day.  A minor mishap occurs.… Life goes on.  Unfortunately, for the Vaneks normal life did
    not go on.  They became obsessed with the
    incident.  In doing so, they were not
    acting like the average concerned parent.  They were displaying a “particular hypersensitivity” (<i>Duwyn v. Kaprielian</i>); they lacked the
    “reasonable fortitude and robustness” (<i>White
    v. Chief Constable of South Yorkshire </i>[<i>Police</i>]) that the law expects of all its
    citizens, including concerned parents.  </p>

    of Mr. Mustapha?  Mr. Pape says: because
    Mr. Mustapha was not a bystander but a primary participant and this rendered
    reasonable foreseeability of psychiatric harm unnecessary.  He submits that it was reasonably foreseeable
    that a purchaser or consumer of Culligan water would be injured in some fashion

line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Essentially, the criticisms are threefold.  First, removal of the requirement for
    foreseeability of the <i>type</i> of harm
    incurred, in relation to the primary victim cases, runs contrary to the
    fundamental principle of tort law as established in <i>The Wagon Mound No.&nbsp;1<a href="#_ftn5"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[6]</span></span></span></a><i> </i>(the particular type of injury must be
    foreseeable).  In Lord Goff’s view, in <i>White</i>, <i>supra</i>, at pp. 474-475, “Lord Lloyd [in <i>Page</i>] dethroned foreseeability of
    psychiatric injury from its central position as the unifying feature of
    this  branch of the law.”  Secondly, the distinction between primary
    victims and secondary victims is an artificial one that camouflages the policy
    choices that have to be made and moreover, is problematic in application.  The case at bar is a good example of this
    problem, as I shall explore in a moment.  As Bélanger-Hardy, <i>supra</i>, at p. 564, notes,<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[7]</span></span></span></a> the distinction “allows artificial criteria to displace the more natural
    question: should the defendant be liable to the plaintiff in all the
    circumstances?”  Finally, the critics
    observe that the majority in <i>Page </i>have
    misunderstood the thinskull plaintiff principle, which relates only to quantum
    of damages once liability has already been established.  As Lord Wright explained in <i>Bourhill v. Young</i>, [1943] A.C. 92 (H.L.)
    – a seminal nervous shock case – at 109-110:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>No doubt, it has long
    ago been stated and often restated that if the wrong is established the
    wrongdoer must take the victim as he finds him.  That, however, is only true … on the condition that the wrong has been
    established or admitted.  The question of
    liability is anterior to the question of the measure of the consequences which
    go with the liability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I find these criticisms persuasive.  In particular, the view that the <i>Page v. Smith</i> distinction is artificial
    and not always easy to apply resonates in this case.  Is Mr. Mustapha indeed a “primary victim”, or
    is he a bystander or “secondary victim”?  Is he both?  Or neither?  An argument can be made that he falls into
    any of these four categories.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He was a “participant” in the event giving rise to the
    claim.  He was present and observed the
    dead fly in the bottle, saw his wife’s reaction to it, and experienced his
    own.  Arguably, then, he is a primary
    victim.  On the other hand, the “primary
    victim” rationale, as developed in the English authorities, is based upon the
    premise that the participant is “within the range of foreseeable <i>physical</i> injury”: <i>Page, supra</i>, at p. 184, <i>per</i> Lord Lloyd [emphasis added].  Once that
    is established, it matters not whether the actual harm sustained is physical or
    psychiatric.  Here, however, Mr. Mustapha
    was never within a range of foreseeable physical injury.  Nobody drank anything from the bottle.  It remained sealed.  There can be no physical harm from merely <i>seeing</i> a dead fly in a bottle of
    water.  The Law Lords in <i>Page </i>do not seem to have contemplated a
    situation where, as here, although the victim is a “participant” in the event
    giving rise to the claim, and consequently suffers direct psychiatric harm,
    there is no reasonable foreseeability of physical harm.  On this argument, then, Mr. Mustapha cannot
    be said to be a “primary victim”</p>

line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is he a “secondary victim”?  The bystander cases are premised on a
    psychiatric reaction resulting from the plaintiff having seen a traumatic event
    causing injury to someone else (or having learned of the injury in the
    aftermath of the event).  Here, Mr.
    Mustapha’s reaction was based primarily on his concern about the impact that
    consuming contaminated water may have had on his family’s welfare – on its
    face, a bystander type of situation.  Yet, no other member of his family sustained physical or psychiatric
    injuries as a result of the incident.  Mr. Mustapha simply became obsessed with the possibility that they might
    have sustained such injuries in the past or might in the future.  Is that sufficient to bring him within the
    “bystander” category?  </p>

    concluding that the test for foreseeability in a psychiatric harm case should
    depend upon the outcome of the exercise of determining whether the plaintiff is
    a primary or secondary victim.  Instead,
    I prefer the reasoning of the dissenting opinions in <i>Page </i>rejecting the distinction between primary and secondary
    victims, and concluding that even a plaintiff who was involved in the incident
    must demonstrate reasonable foreseeability of psychiatric illness in order to
    recover in tort.  Lord Jauncey said at p.

    none of the judgments was it suggested that the need to prove foreseeability of
    nervous shock was other than a general requirement applicable to all cases
    where damages therefor were claimed…. In the second place foreseeability of
    injury is necessary to determine whether a duty is owed to the victim.  Unless such injury can be foreseen the victim
    is not a neighbour within the celebrated dictum of Lord Atkin in <i>Donoghue v. Stevenson</i>….</p>

    defendant must take the victim as the victim is found, there is no requirement
    in a primary victim case that the plaintiff be of normal fortitude.  At p.178 he observed:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='

    determining whether a tortfeasor should have foreseen that either a participant
    or a bystander would suffer nervous shock as a result of his negligent act the

    psychiatric harm, I nonetheless accept that the authorities support an approach
    to liability in such cases that involves a consideration of policy issues in
    addition to reasonable foreseeability alone.  This is consistent with the two-part <i>Anns </i> test as adopted in <i>Kamloops, supra</i>, namely, (i) whether
    there is a sufficiently close relationship of proximity or neighbourhood
    between the parties, such that in the reasonable contemplation of the alleged
    wrongdoer, carelessness on his or her part may be likely to cause damage to the
    defendant; and, if so (ii) whether there are any considerations which ought to
    negative or limit (a) the scope of the duty and (b) the class of persons to
    whom it is owed or (c) the damages to which a breach of it may give rise.  This test clearly imports both the notion of
    reasonable foreseeability and policy limitations on the scope of liability even

    is not a question that needs to be decided on the facts of this case.  Canadian courts have resorted to all of them,
    in some fashion, on occasion.  It is
    clear that Mr. Mustapha satisfies those criteria in any event.  The concerns driving his obsession about the
    dead fly in the bottle were centred on the possible impact the consumption of
    contaminated water had, or might have in the future, on his family (relational
    proximity), and he was present at the event itself and witnessed the fly in the
    bottle (locational and temporal proximity). </p>

    however, is the following:  what is the
    ambit of liability in psychiatric harm cases where the harm suffered (a) is
    significantly disproportionate to the relatively inconsequential nature of the
    incident in question, and (b) is a function of the particular sensibilities of
    the plaintiff rather than a function of the sensibilities that a person of
    normal fortitude would demonstrate?  This
    concern is accommodated, in my view, by factoring the “person of normal fortitude
    and robustness” principle into the reasonable foreseeability equation, as this

    what <i>reasonable</i> foreseeability

line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was alert to the principle of Canadian
    tort law that “reasonable foresight of nervous shock to the plaintiff is the
    touchstone of liability”:<i> Haliburton
    Estate, supra</i>, at p. 518.  He was
    also aware of Lord Griffith’s statement in <i>White</i>, at p. 463, to the effect that it
    must be “reasonably foreseeable that a person of reasonable robustness and
    fortitude would be likely to suffer psychiatric injury”, and of the fact that
    this Court adopted that principle in <i>Vanek</i>.  At paras. 226-227 of his reasons, he distinguished <i>White</i>, on the basis that “[h]ere, we
    are not dealing with South Yorkshire Police constables.  We are dealing with an urban, and urbane,
    hair stylist”, and concluded as follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Moreover, we are
    dealing with a person with the sensitivities that, in my view, would make him
    what he was – a good and faithful customer of the Culligan company for some 15
    years, buying and using their water both at his home and at his business.  He was very concerned over the purity and
    healthfulness of the water that he and his family consumed, and was convinced,
    by the Culligan representatives, that their water was better, purer and safer
    than the water supplied by the city public utility system.  Given that, it in my view was clearly
    foreseeable to Culligan that if it supplied a water bottle with dead flies
    floating around in it, Mr. Mustapha, and other customers like him, would suffer
    “some degree” of nervous shock.  In my
    view, in the particular circumstances of this case, the foreseeability test has
    been met.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Here,
    the resulting problems for Mr. Mustapha were unexpectedly severe, but in my
    view that was because of his previous history and the particular circumstances
    of this case.  Because of cultural
    factors, he had an unusually high concern over the health and well being of his
    family.  His wife maintained an unusually
    clean home, and was concerned about their health and the health of their
    children.  He and his wife had planned a
    pregnancy, even though he knew their previous child was born prematurely, and
    that Mrs. Mustapha had reached an age where there was some concern over this
    pregnancy.  In fact, the doctor had
    warned of high risk shortly before this incident.  All of these factors contributed to his
    obsessive thinking after seeing the fly, which progressed to the state
    diagnosed by his various experts.  Although his wife’s subsequent problems, and eventual premature delivery
    were no doubt very stressful, and contributed to his eventual condition, there
    is no indication that those stresses, absent the fly in the bottle, would have
    developed into the psychological illness from which he presently suffers.</p>

line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These paragraphs represent the nub of the trial judge’s
    reasoning respecting foreseeability on the facts of the case.  It is apparent that he was focused primarily,
    if not exclusively, on the peculiar impact seeing the dead fly in the bottle
    had on Mr. Mustapha arising from “his previous history”, his “unusually high
    concern over the health and well being of his family”, the “unusually clean
    home” maintained by Mrs. Mustapha, and his concerns over the risks of her
    pregnancy.  The trial judge’s comment
    that it was foreseeable to Culligan “that if it supplied a water bottle with
    dead flies floating around in it, Mr. Mustapha, and other customers<i> </i>like him, would suffer ‘some degree’ of
    nervous shock”, must be viewed in that light.  The reference to “other customers <i>like
    him</i>” turns the analysis right back to the subjective specific sensibilities
    of Mr. Mustapha.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All of the medical evidence characterized Mr.
    Mustapha’s reaction in individualistic terms and, in varying ways, as unique
    and strange.  Dr. Chung said, “[H]e had
    never seen anything quite like the symptomatology described by Mr. Mustapha,
    and he felt it was highly unusual.”  Dr.
    Rai testified that the appellant’s fear was “a rational fear <i>for that particular individual</i>”
    [emphasis added].  Dr. Litman said that
    Mr. Mustapha displayed a “very individual response, depending on the
    vulnerabilities of the particular individual.”  The experts were not asked to comment on the objective component of the <i>Vanek</i> test, namely, whether a person of
    normal fortitude would be likely to suffer psychiatric injury from having seen
    a dead fly in a bottle of water from which no water had been consumed.</p>

line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the trial judge made no finding – nor was
    there evidence to support one – that Culligan was made aware of, or ought to
    have known, anything about the particular sensibilities of Mr. Mustapha and his
    family.  The appellant’s reaction to the
    fly-in-the-bottle incident was “abnormal”, a product of his “particular
    hypersensitivity” (<i>Duwyn</i>); it was not
    the response of the “average sensitive” person (<i>Haliburton Estate</i>); nor was it the response of a person of
    “reasonable fortitude and robustness” (<i>White </i>and <i>Vanek</i>).  These objective elements are essential to the
    psychiatric harm analysis.  Respectfully,
    the trial judge erred in failing to take into account the objective component
    of the test for reasonable foreseeability in such circumstances, focusing
    entirely, instead, on the individual characteristics and vulnerabilities of the
    appellant.</p>

    considering, as illustrated in para. 240 of his reasons, whether there was a
    foreseeable “<i>possibility</i> of damage,
    including psychological damage” [Emphasis added] arising as a result of seeing
    the dead fly in the bottle of water, rather than considering whether there was
    a foreseeable “probability” of such damage.  As Abella J.A. observed, in <i>Nespolon</i>, <i>supra, </i>at pp. 363-364:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A duty of care
    will only be found where the resultant harm is reasonably foreseeable.  In order to determine whether the harm was or

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In
    his text <i>The Law of Torts in Canada</i>,
    Professor G.H.L. Fridman confirms this nexus as follows: “Foreseeability of
    harm is a necessary ingredient of a relationship that is apt to give rise to a
    duty of care” (vol. 1 (Toronto: Carswell, 1989) at p. 235).  Foreseeability, in other words, arises where
    the harm resulting from the conduct of the defendant was, or ought to have been
    contemplated by the alleged wrongdoer as a <i>probable
    consequence</i> of  his or her actions
    (at p. 238).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>As
    characterized by Fridman, “[o]nly if what happened is considered to be a

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Damages
    for breach of contract should, as far as money can do it, place the plaintiff
    in the same position as if the contract had been performed.  However, at least since the 1854 decision of
    the Court of Exchequer Chamber in <i>Hadley
    v. Baxendale</i> [citations omitted], it has been the law that these damages
    must be “such as may fairly and reasonably be considered either arising
    naturally … from such breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be
    supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties”….</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In <i>Hadley v. Baxendale</i>, the court explained the principle

    circumstances under which the contract was actually made were communicated by
    the plaintiffs to the defendants, and thus known to both parties, the damages
    resulting from the breach of such a contract, which they would reasonably
    contemplate, would be the amount of injury which would ordinarily follow from a
    breach of contract under these special circumstances so known and
    communicated.  But, on the other hand, if
    these special circumstances were wholly unknown to the party breaching the
    contract, he, at the most, could only be supposed to have had in his
    contemplation the amount of injury which would <i>arise generally, and in the great multitude of cases</i> not affected

    of harm – in the words of <i>Hadley</i>, <i>supra</i> at p. 151, – that “would arise

    trial judge appears to use the terms “psychiatric illness” and “psychological
    illness” interchangeably.  In <i>Vanek</i>, below,<i> </i>at paras.
    62-68, this Court declined to reconsider the settled law in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario that recovery in cases of this
    nature cannot take place without the finding of a “recognized psychiatric
    illness”.  Counsel made no issue of this
    distinction in this case.  I assume for
    purposes of deciding it, therefore, that Mr. Mustapha’s illness, as found, is
    accepted as sufficient to justify recovery, whether characterized as
    “psychiatric” or “psychological” in nature.  “Nervous shock” is the term most frequently employed in past
    jurisprudence to describe this type of illness.  Recent authorities have recognized that the medical term “psychiatric
    illness” is more appropriate.</p>

    leading English authorities of<i> White</i>, above, and <i>Alcock</i>, above, are
    companion cases arising out of a disaster that occurred at the Hillsborough
    stadium in England after spectators were permitted to enter an already crowded
    soccer stadium through negligently opened gates.  About ninety people were crushed to death and
    several hundred were injured.  The
    plaintiffs in <i>Alcock</i> were relatives
    of victims, who were either at the stadium or had witnessed the tragedy on live
    television and suffered post-traumatic stress syndrome as a result.  Their claims foundered on one or another of
    the proximity tests later confirmed in <i>White</i>.  The plaintiffs in <i>White</i> were police officers who had been at the scene and also
    suffered post traumatic stress as a result.  They argued that their situations were different from those of the <i>Alcock</i> plaintiffs because they were
    employees of the Chief Constable and because they were rescuers.  Their claims also failed.</p>
