      starting point for analyzing the legal status of the settlement agreement
      is to consider the situation that existed immediately before Rebecca Wu’s
      unexpected death. In <i>Smallman v. Smallman</i>, [1971] 3 All E.R. 717
      at 720 (C.A.), Denning M.R. provided the following helpful statement of
      the legal status of a settlement agreement that is subject to court approval:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>In my opinion, if the parties have reached an agreement on all
    essential matters, then the clause
    ‘subject to the approval of the court’ does not mean there is no agreement
    at all.  There is an agreement, but the operation of it is suspended until
    the court approves it.  It is the duty of one party or the other to bring
    the agreement before the court for approval.  If the court approves, it is
    binding on the parties.  If the court does not approve, it is not binding.  But,
    pending the application to the court, it remains a binding agreement which
    neither party can disavow.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      requirement for court approval of settlements made on behalf of parties
      under disability is derived from the court’s <i>parens patriae</i> jurisdiction.  The <i>parens
      patriae</i> jurisdiction is of ancient origin and is “founded on necessity,
      namely the need to act for the protection of those who cannot care for
      themselves…to be exercised in the ‘best interest’ of the protected person…for
      his or her ‘benefit or ‘welfare’”: <i>Re Eve,</i> [1986] 2 S.C.R. 388 at
      para. 73.  The jurisdiction is “essentially protective” and “neither creates
      substantive rights nor changes the means by which claims are determined”: <i>Tsaoussis
      (Litigation Guardian of) v. Baetz</i> (1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 257 at 268 (C.A.).  The
      duty of the court is to examine the settlement and ensure that it is in
      the best interests of the party under disability: <i>Poulin v. Nadon</i>,
      [1950] O.R. 219 (C.A.).  The purpose of court approval is plainly to protect
      the party under disability and to ensure that his or her legal rights are
      not compromised or surrendered without proper compensation.  </span></p>

    explained by Garry D. Watson &amp; Craig Perkins, <i>Holmested and Watson:
    Ontario Civil Procedure</i>, looseleaf (Toronto: Carswell, 1984) vol. 2 at
    7-33 </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Rule 7.08… merely
    codifies a rule established by case law that a party under disability is
    bound only by a settlement that is for his or her benefit….it is designed
    to protect the party under disability from mistakes of the litigation guardian.  The
    settlement of a claim by or against a party under disability, whether or
    not a proceeding has been commenced, is not binding on the party under disability

      wording of rule 7.08(1) may be contrasted with the language of the English
    “compromise rule” that provides that no settlement involving a party under
    disability shall “be valid without the approval of the court.”  This wording
    was considered by the House of Lords in <i>Dietz v. Lennig Chemicals</i>,<i> </i>[1969]
    1 A.C. 170 to deprive a settlement that is subject to court approval of any
    legal effect and to allow either party to repudiate it unless and until it
    was approved by the court.  The situation in Ontario is different: see <i>Richard
    (Litigation Guardian of) v. Worth</i> (2004), 73 O.R. (3d) 154 (S.C.J.),
    holding that an insurer could not repudiate an infant settlement, yet to
    be approved by the court, on the ground that the law relating the insurer’s
    liability had been changed by </span>a subsequent Court of Appeal decision<span
style='font-size:11.5pt;'>.</span><span lang=EN-US>  The effect of rule 7.08(1)
    coincides with <i>Smallman v. Smallman, supra</i>, to this extent: the party
    under disability has an agreement from which the opposite party cannot resile
    and that will become fully operational once approved by the court. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
      conclude from this analysis that immediately prior to Rebecca Wu’s death
      there was in law an agreement, which the respondents could not disavow,
      to settle her claim on the terms recorded in the minutes of settlement,
      but that the operation of that agreement was suspended pending “necessary” court
      approval. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      crucial issue for us to decide is what effect did Rebecca Wu’s death have
      on the status of the settlement agreement?  The respondents make two central
      submissions. First, they say that the obligation to pay the settlement
      never arose because the requirement for court approval was never met. They
      say that the application judge correctly found that the requirement for
      court approval is a “true condition precedent” upon which the existence
      of any contractual obligation to pay depends and, as the settlement was
      not approved, it died with Rebecca Wu.  Second, the respondents submit
      that it is an implicit term of the settlement that Rebecca Wu must be alive
      to permit the court to approve it.  As her death makes court approval impossible,
      the respondents submit that the agreement must be treated as being void <i>ab
      initio</i>. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For
      the following reasons, we are unable to accept the respondents’ submissions. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With
      respect to the respondent’s first submission, we do not agree that that
      the settlement died with Rebecca Wu.  Prior to her death, Rebecca Wu’s
      claim for accident benefits had, by virtue of the settlement, become a
      contractual right to the agreed amount, contingent upon obtaining the court’s
      approval of the settlement.  That contractual right was a chose in action
      that, by operation of law, devolved to Rebecca Wu’s estate upon her death:  <i>Estates
      Administration Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.E.22, s. 2.; Carmen S. Thériault
      ed, <i>Widdifield on Executors and Trusts</i>, looseleaf (Toronto: Carswell,
      2002) at p. 2-52:  “The general principle is that a right of action in
      common law survives death and is transmissible automatically to the personal
      representative.”  By their terms, the minutes of settlement speak of “necessary” court
      approval.  Once Rebecca Wu’s contractual right passed to the estate, there
      was no longer a party under disability. Court approval was no longer necessary
      to protect the interest of the party seeking to enforce the settlement.  As
      the need for court approval disappeared upon Rebecca Wu’s death, the minutes
      of settlement became operational and her estate could enforce the obligation
      to pay. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This
      analysis is supported by a purposive interpretation of the need for court
      approval.  The respondents’ argument that the settlement in Rebecca Wu’s
      favour should be nullified because it was not approved in her lifetime
      runs directly contrary to the protective purpose of <i>parens patriae</i> jurisdiction
      and of court approval of settlements involving parties under disability.  The
      risk created by the enforced gap in time to allow the court to review the
      settlement to ensure it meets the plaintiff’s interests should not be borne
      by the plaintiff and <i>parens patriae</i> jurisdiction should not be used
      to defeat the very interests it serves to protect.  In this regard, we
      find persuasive the reasoning in <i>Reed v. United States of America</i>,
      891 F. 2d 878 at 881 (11<sup>th</sup> Cir. 1990).  The claim of an infant
      plaintiff was settled days prior to his death and “all that remained for
      final judgment to obtain was for the court to approve the settlement and
      enter judgment.”  The court ruled that as “[t]he statute requiring court
      approval is designed for the protection of minors” and as the defendant
      had agreed to settle the case, the only legitimate basis for refusing enforcement
      would be the failure of the agreement to protect the minor’s interests.  See
      also <i>Blackhurst v. Transamerica Insurance Co.</i>, 699 P. 2d 688 (Sup.
      Ct. of Utah 1985).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In <i>Olive
        Clear v. Thermal (Ireland) Limited</i>, [1969] I.R. 133, the Supreme
        Court of Ireland considered the enforceability of an infant settlement
        where the infant had died prior to court approval.  O’Dalaigh C.J. analyzed
        the legal effect of the settlement in terms similar to those expressed
        in <i>Smallman v. Smallman</i>, <i>supra</i>, but ruled, at p. 139, that
        the requirement for court approval implied that the infant must be alive.
        We return to the issue of post-death court approval below, but for present
        purposes the significant point from this decision is that the other two
        members of the court suggested that the settlement contract survived
        and that the proper procedure was for the infant’s estate to sue upon
        the contract: per Walsh J. at p. 140 and per Budd J. at p. 141. Accordingly,
        although the court concluded that the settlement could not be approved
        after the death of the infant plaintiff, there is a majority view that
        the settlement contract could be enforced at the suit of the infant’s
        estate despite the fact that it had never been approved by the court. </span></p>

      do we agree with the submission that the issue before us should be resolved
      on the basis of <i>Turney v. Zilka</i>, [1959] S.C.R. 578 and so-called “true
      conditions precedent”.  <i>Turney v. Zilka</i> involved an agreement for
      the purchase and sale of land that made the contract conditional on the
      annexation of the subject property to another municipality.  The Supreme
      Court of Canada rejected the contention that the clause was for the benefit
      of the purchaser and could therefore be waived by the purchaser.  As the
      condition had not been met, neither party had any right to enforce performance.  Judson
      J. explained at pp. 583-84: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>T</span>he obligations under the contract, on both sides, depend upon
    a future uncertain event, the happening of which depends entirely on the
    will of a third party…This is a true condition precedent – an external condition
    upon which the existence of the obligation depends.  Until the event occurs
    there is no right to performance on either side.   </p>

        v. Zilka</span></i><span lang=EN-US> and other similar cases involving “true
        conditions precedent” typically involve the interpretation of agreements
        for the purchase and sale of real estate and terms negotiated by the
        parties to allocate the risk of uncertain future events, such as planning
        approval, that are beyond the control of the parties but that will affect
        the value of the property that is the subject of the contract.  That
        contractual setting is, in our view, distinguishable from the circumstances
        of the present case.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    determining whether a contractual term is to be considered a “true condition
    precedent,” the intentions of the parties must be considered: see <i>Kempling
    v. Hearthstone Manor Corp., </i>[1996] A.J. No. 654 at para. 32 (C.A.).  See
    also G. Davies,
    “Conditional Contracts of the Sale of Land in Canada” (1977), 55 Can. Bar
    Rev. 289 at 322: “a desirable approach to the interpretation of conditional
    contracts would be to recognize that the effect of a condition must depend
    upon the language in which it is expressed with the result that conditions
    must be subjected to individual scrutiny.”  <span
lang=EN-US>The requirement for court approval in the case at bar was not a negotiated
    term designed to allocate the risk of an uncertain future event that would
    affect the value of the bargain.  As reflected by the language of the minutes
    of settlement - “subject to <i>necessary</i> court approval” - the requirement
    for court approval was a term legally imposed upon the parties specifically
    to protect the interests of the party under disability.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It
      is significant that rule 7.08(1) provides that the agreement is not binding
      on the party under disability unless the court approves the agreement,
      but says nothing to limit the binding effect of the agreement on the other
      party.  This reflects the unilateral and protective purpose of court approval
      that is related to ensuring the fairness of the agreement itself, quite
      unlike the type of extraneous third-party decision at issue in <i>Turney
      v. Zilka</i>.  In our view, <i>Turney v. Zilka</i> does not apply to the
      contract at issue here.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With
      respect to the respondent’s second submission, even if we were to accept
      the respondents’ submission that court approval is a “condition precedent” that
      must be satisfied to make the agreement enforceable by the appellant, we
      see no reason why court approval cannot be granted despite Rebecca Wu’s
      death.  The purposive interpretation of the <i>parens patriae</i> jurisdiction
      and rule 7.8(1) that we have already outlined suggests that authority to
      approve the settlement should survive the death of the party under disability
      to the benefit of that party’s estate. There was an obvious risk that Rebecca
      Wu might die earlier than projected and the respondents must have taken
      into account her projected life expectancy as one of the many contingencies
      that influenced their assessment of the value of her claim:  <i>White (Litigation
      Guardian of) v. Godin, </i>[1997] O.J. No. 314 (C.A.) at para. 3: “In agreeing
      to the assessment of damages, the defendants knew that there was a risk
      that their evaluation of the life expectancy of the plaintiff…might be
      proved wrong by future events.”  Parties under disability cannot re-open
      settled claims when unfavourable contingencies materialize: see <i>Tsaoussis
      (Litigation Guardian of) v. Baetz, supra</i>.  Fairness requires similar
      treatment for insurers. The minutes of settlement could have provided that
      Rebecca Wu must be alive at the time of court approval but they do not.
      We do not agree that it would be just to imply a term that would, after
      the fact, materially alter the parties’ allocation of the risk related
      to her life expectancy.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      do not find persuasive the opinion to the contrary in <i>Olive Clear v.
      Thermal (Ireland) Limited</i>, <i>supra</i>. O’Dalaigh C.J., at pp. 138-39,
      gave the following example which corresponds to some degree to the case
      at bar:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>An example will illustrate the point.  A defendant, in a case
    of paraplegic injury to an infant plaintiff, agrees to pay to the next friend
    a large sum for damages, a great part of which is calculated to be in respect
    of full-time nursing care.  Before approval of the settlement the infant
    dies from extraneous causes.  The infant’s death, as it seems to me, prevents
    the exercise of the court’s function of pronouncing on the adequacy of the
    settlement.  A new situation has arisen; a situation which the parties have
    not contemplated.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The death of
    the infant alters the basis of the settlement, and its effect must, in my
    opinion, be to discharge the parties.  The foundation of their dealings,
    the continued existence of the infant, is withdrawn, and the parties are
    left to such rights as they had before the settlement was entered into and
    as survive the infant’s death.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      death of the plaintiff may eliminate the cost of future care and thereby
      diminish the value of the claim but, for the reasons already expressed,
      it does not create a new situation that should not have been contemplated
      by the parties. Life expectancy is but one of many contingencies that parties
      settling personal injury claims are bound to take into account when determining
      the worth of the claim, and the unexpected death of the plaintiff does
      not remove the entire foundation for the agreement. </span></p>

      and, in any event, was <i>obiter</i> as the court held that no contract
      had been formed prior to the infant plaintiff’s death. </span></p>

      to settle Rebecca Wu’s accident benefits claim.  When they decided to settle
      the claim for that amount, they were in possession of all the relevant
      facts respecting the claim and had ample opportunity to assess all contingencies.  There
