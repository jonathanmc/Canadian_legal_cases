  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from conviction by
      Justice J. Robert MacKinnon of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with
      a jury, dated March 10, 2005 and sentence imposed May 3, 2005.</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>APPEAL&nbsp;BOOK ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Of
    the various grounds of appeal raised by the appellant against conviction,
    we are not persuaded that the trial judge erred in refusing to order severance
    of the breach of probation charge. The trial judge felt that any possible
    prejudice could be dealt with by way of a limiting instruction and he was
    obviously concerned that the appellant might, at the end of the trial, go
    back on his undertaking, thereby necessitating a second trial on all of the
    same evidence. In the end, we are not persuaded that the trial judge erred
    in exercising his discretion as he did. This ground therefore fails. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Likewise,
    we think it was open to the trial judge, in the exercise of his discretion,
    to admit the “prior relationship” evidence concerning the appellant’s hostile
    relationship with his neighbours. The trial judge weighed the probative value
    of the evidence and measured it against its prejudicial effect. In the end,
    he concluded that the evidence was sufficiently probative to warrant its
    reception and that a strong limiting instruction would eliminate any concern
    about prejudice. We are not persuaded that he erred in exercising his discretion
    as he did. Accordingly, we would not give effect to this ground.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Finally,
    we reject the appellant’s “inconsistent verdicts” argument. In our view,
    it was open to the jury to find that the appellant tussled with the complainant
    over the shovel and that in doing so, he applied force either directly or
    indirectly to her person without her consent. It was also open to the jury,
    we believe, to find that in the course of the tussle, the appellant took
    possession of the shovel in circumstances where it was capable of, and intended
    by him, to be used as a weapon. This conclusion follows from the fact that
    the appellant was clearly not planning to use the shovel to remove snow and
    he did not rely upon self-defence. In that regard, even though there may
    have been some confusion on the record about the viability of that defence,
    in the end, we have great difficulty accepting that there was an error of
    reality to it in the circumstances. Accordingly, this ground of appeal also
    fails. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to sentence, we would not interfere with the eight-month sentence
    imposed for assault. We note in that regard that the trial judge gave the
    appellant credit for the equivalent of four months in pre-trial custody.
    In other words, he considered the assault to be worth twelve months. We think
    that range of sentence was fit in the circumstances. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would, however, interfere with the six-month consecutive sentence imposed
    for the breach of probation. The breach in question was inextricably linked
    to the assault. Because of that, we think that the total sentence was too
    high. That said, we are satisfied that a consecutive sentence was warranted.
    In our view, two months consecutive for the breach of probation charge would
    have been the proper sentence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    leave to appeal sentence is granted. The sentence for the breach of probation
    is reduced from six months consecutive to two months consecutive. In all
    other respects, we would not interfere with the sentence imposed.</p>
