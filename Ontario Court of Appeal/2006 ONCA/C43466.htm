  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the sentence imposed by
    Justice Eric R. Libman of the Ontario Court of Justice, dated April 27, 2005</span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>.</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant pled guilty to several fraud related offences
    and was sentenced by the trial judge to a term of incarceration of four months
    with terms of probation for a period of two years and ordered to make full
    restitution.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant abused his position of trust as an account
    supervisor to defraud his employer of over $70,000, over a one-year period, by
    means of a relatively sophisticated scheme.  The money was used by the appellant to finance his gambling activities
    and to play the stock market.  As a
    result of unrelated attempts to defraud the company an investigation uncovered
    the appellant’s crimes.  None of the
    proceeds of the fraud were recovered.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his notice of appeal, the appellant submits that the appeal
    be allowed, and a conditional sentence substituted on two bases: (1) the trial
    judge failed to give adequate reasons for the sentence of incarceration which
    was imposed; and, (2) the sentence of incarceration imposed was manifestly
    unfit.  The second ground of appeal was
    abandoned by the appellant during oral argument.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the adequacy of the reasons for sentence, we
    are all of the view that the trial judge adequately explained his decision to
    impose a sentence of incarceration, rather than a conditional sentence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reasons for sentence contained an exhaustive marshalling
    of pertinent aggravating and mitigating factors.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the trial judge indicated he was alive to the
    principles applicable to the imposition of conditional sentences as outlined by
    the Supreme Court of Canada in the seminal decision of <i>R. v. Proulx</i> (2000), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 449.  More
    particularly, the trial judge indicated that he appreciated that no type of
    case, including those involving breaches of trust and serious fraud, excludes
    the conditional sentence regime and that the conditional sentence regime itself
    provides for denunciation and deterrence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, the trial judge was of the view that in
    balancing and weighing the aggravating and mitigating factors and having regard
    to the jurisprudence of this court in such cases as <i>R. v. Dobis</i> (2002),
    58 O.R. (3d) 536 and <i>R. v. Suhr</i>, [2002] O.J. No. 4315, the principles of
    sentencing that were controlling were denunciation and general deterrence and
    accountability for one’s actions.  He
    concluded that the case law supported a sentence in the range of six to nine
    months but, in view of the remorse shown by the appellant and his early plea,
    leniency was appropriate, resulting in a sentence of four months.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, it cannot reasonably be said that the reasons for
    sentence are incomprehensible or that the reasoning of the trial judge is
    unavailable to the appellant, or that the reasons are impervious to appellate
    review.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, the appeal must be dismissed.  Leave to appeal sentence is granted, but the
    appeal is dismissed.  </p>
