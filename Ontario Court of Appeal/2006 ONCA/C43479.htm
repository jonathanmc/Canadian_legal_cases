  <p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>On appeal from the judgment

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    outcome of this appeal hinges on the proper construction of a policy of insurance
    known in the industry as a “Movers and Warehousemens’
    Insurance Policy”. The policy was issued by Lloyd’s of London (“Lloyd’s”)
    to Kennedy Moving and Storage Limited (“Kennedy”). It is a comprehensive
    policy that provides coverage for many risks, including loss of property
    entrusted to Kennedy by a customer for transportation or storage purposes.
    In the case of such losses, absent agreement between Kennedy and its customer,
    the policy caps the amount of coverage for any one occurrence. In the case
    of “Transportation Insurance”, the limit is $500,000; for “Warehouse Insurance”,
    the limit is $1,000,000. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the case at hand, the application judge was called upon to determine which
    of those limits applied to a claim exceeding $500,000, where the loss was
    sustained by  Kennedy’s customers, Stuart Solway and Gayle Akler (“the Solways”).
    Kennedy had contracted with the Solways to move their household belongings
    to a new home. Under the terms of the agreement, evidenced by a bill of lading,
    the Solways’ belongings were to be picked up by Kennedy on February 1, 1999
    and delivered to their new home on February 15, 1999. By way of separate
    agreement, arrived at orally by the parties, Kennedy assured the Solways
    that during the two-week hiatus period, their belongings would be safely
    stored in a trailer that was to be secured and parked at all times on the
    parking lot adjacent to Kennedy’s business premises.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Kennedy
    failed to live up to its end of the bargain and the trailer was stolen while
    it was parked one night on the street in front of Kennedy’s business location.
    The contents were never recovered. That precipitated an action by the Solways
    against Kennedy in which the Solways eventually obtained judgment for more
    than $500,000. Attempts to collect on that judgment proved unsuccessful and
    the Solways applied under s. 132 of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. I. 8 to recover the amount of the judgment from Lloyd’s.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the application, Lloyd’s took the position that the loss occurred while the
    goods were in storage incidental to transit. As such, Lloyd’s maintained
    that the extent of its liability was $500,000. Allianz Insurance Company
    of Canada (“Allianz”), with which Kennedy maintained an excess commercial
    umbrella policy, took a different view. According to Allianz, because the
    goods were stored when they were stolen, the warehouse provisions of the
    policy governed. Hence, Lloyd’s liability extended to $1,000,000. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge agreed with Allianz and ordered Lloyd’s to pay the sum
    of $756,005.93 to the Solways “in full satisfaction of the damages, costs,
    pre-judgment interest and post-judgment interest” owing to them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lloyd’s
    appeals from that order. It submits that the application judge erred in finding
    that its liability under the policy extended to $1,000,000 (the policy limit
    for Warehouse Insurance) instead of $500,000 (the policy limit for Transportation
    Insurance). Lloyd’s further contends that if its liability is limited to
    $500,000, it should not be required to pay beyond that limit for post-judgment
    interest accruing from the Solway/Kennedy action; nor should it be required
    to pay beyond that limit for any costs arising out of the Solway/Kennedy
    action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    reasons that follow, I agree with Lloyd’s that its liability under the policy
    should have been limited to $500,000. I disagree with Lloyd’s on the issue
    of post-judgment interest and costs.  To the extent that such interest and
    costs exceed the policy limit, Lloyd’s is responsible to pay the additional
    amounts. Accordingly, I would allow the appeal in part.</p>

    order to appreciate the reasons of the application judge and to see where,
    in my respectful view, he went wrong in his analysis, it is necessary to
    briefly review the reasons for judgment given by Himel J. in the action brought
    by the Solways against Kennedy [her reasons are reported at (2001), 57 O.R.
    (3d) 205]. This is particularly so given that the parties to the s. 132 application
    accepted the findings of fact made by Himel J. and those findings, along
    with the legal consequences flowing from them, formed the backdrop against
    which the application was argued.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>HIMEL
      J.’S REASONS FOR JUDGMENT</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    action before Himel J. involved a number of issues, several of which need
    not concern us. For present purposes, it is only necessary to understand
    the basis upon which she fixed Kennedy with liability for the loss sustained
    by the Solways and the basis upon which she determined the extent of Kennedy’s
    liability, (<i>i.e.</i>, how much Kennedy owed to the Solways).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue of the basis for Kennedy’s liability was non-contentious.  Kennedy
    accepted that it was liable to the Solways for failing to deliver their belongings
    in accordance with the terms of the bill of lading. That is made clear in
    paras. 91 and 92 of Himel J.’s reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>There is no
    question and the defence [Kennedy] admits that the plaintiffs’ [the Solways’]
    loss as a result of the theft was significant. Although it has not paid what
    it says it owes under the limitation of liability clause, the defence admits
    that it owes approximately $7,000 to the plaintiffs.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The contract
    between the parties was for carriage and storage of goods. That contract
    was partly written and partly oral consisting of the proposal, the oral arrangements
    and the bill of lading. <i>Under the terms of the contract, failure to deliver
    the goods is a breach and the defendant is liable</i> [emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    as Himel J. observed, Kennedy conceded that it was liable to the Solways
    for failing to deliver their goods. The only contentious issue was the amount
    Kennedy owed to the Solways. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    accordance with Kennedy’s admission, Himel J. found that Kennedy’s liability
    stemmed not from its failure to safely store the goods, but from its failure
    under the terms of the contract to deliver them. That finding is significant
    and I will return to it later when I come to analyze the application judge’s
    reasons. Suffice it to say that the only portion of the contract that Himel
    J. could have been referring to in regard to Kennedy’s liability was the
    written component consisting of the bill of lading.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    more difficult issue for Himel J. and the one on which Kennedy took its stand,
    was the extent of its liability to the Solways. In that regard, Kennedy relied
    on Condition 5 in the bill of lading, which provided as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>TERMS &amp;
    CONDITIONS</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The carrier
    is not responsible:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>                                                …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>5.  Unless value
    is declared and additional protection is requested, carrier’s liability is
    limited to $0.60 per pound per article including contents, whether such loss
    or damage is arising out of storage, transportation, packing, unpacking or
    handling. If additional protection is requested, the carrier’s liability
    is limited in the case of loss or damage of the entire shipment to the amount
    of the declared value. In the case of partial loss or damage, it will be
    limited to the portion of such loss and damage which such declared value
    bears to the true market value of the entire shipment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    is apparent from the bill of lading and as the parties acknowledge, the Solways
    did not declare the value of their belongings; nor did they request additional
    protection (additional insurance) from Kennedy. Rather, as Himel J. observed
    in her reasons at paragraph 89, the Solways “elected to obtain their own
    insurance for the difference in the value of the goods and what they would
    be owed under the limitation of liability clause.”  In view of that, Kennedy
    maintained that its liability should be limited to 60 cents per pound in
    accordance with Condition 5 of the bill of lading. The Solways disagreed.
    They maintained that Kennedy should be responsible for the replacement value
    of their goods. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    was the central issue dividing the parties. Himel J. recognized it as such
    at paras. 90 and 93 of her reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The central
    question in this case is whether the plaintiffs must bear the loss because
    of a limitation of liability clause in the contract or whether that clause
    does not apply and the defendant is responsible.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The issue is
    whether such liability is limited to 60 cents per pound under the clause
    contained in the bill of lading or whether the defence is precluded from
    relying on that clause. Under the legislative framework, the carrier is liable
    but the limitation of liability is at 60 cents per pound: see Regulation
    1088, <i>Truck Transportation Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, section 3.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    is by now obvious, Himel J. resolved that issue in favour of the Solways.
    In doing so, she rejected Ms. Acker’s evidence on behalf of the Solways that
    she had been told by Kennedy that pending delivery, their belongings would
    be stored at Kennedy’s “climate controlled and monitored”
    warehouse. Nonetheless, based on evidence that she did accept, Himel J. was
    satisfied that “trailer storage was a term of the contract” and that Kennedy
    had assured the Solways that in the two-week period pending delivery, their
    goods would be safely stored in a locked trailer that would at all times
    be parked on Kennedy’s parking lot. Himel J. further found that Kennedy did
    not live up to its end of the bargain and that the trailer was stolen while
    parked one night on the street in front of Kennedy’s business premises. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the circumstances, the question was – who should bear the loss? Himel J.
    decided that issue against Kennedy. Her reasons are found at paras. 99 and
    100 as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In cases where
    loss results because of the acts of a third party, the issue is which party
    should bear the loss? The plaintiffs argue that they entered the contract
    with Kennedy because they were assured of security of their belongings.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In my view,
    it is the defendants who should bear those losses which were attributable
    to the breach of the contract between the parties. They cannot rely on a
    limitation of liability clause where it would be unreasonable to enforce
    it in the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a result of Himel J.’s order, Kennedy ended up owing the Solways close to
    three-quarters of a million dollars.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a> Attempts
    by the Solways to collect on the judgment proved futile. Accordingly, the
    Solways resorted to s. 132 of the <i>Insurance Act, supra</i>, which provides
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>132. (1) Where
    a person incurs a liability for injury or damage to the person or property
    of another, and is insured against such liability, and fails to satisfy a
    judgment awarding damages against the person in respect of the person’s liability,
    and an execution against the person in respect thereof is returned unsatisfied,
    the person entitled to the damages may recover by action against the insurer
    the amount of the judgment up to the face value of the policy, but subject
    to the same equities as the insurer would have if the judgment had been satisfied.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>SECTION
      132 APPLICATION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted earlier, there were two insurers that the Solways could look to under
    s.&nbsp;132 – Lloyd’s, as the primary insurer and Allianz, as the excess
    insurer. Allianz’s potential exposure as the excess insurer depended on the
    extent of Lloyd’s exposure under its policy with Kennedy. If the Solways’ loss
    came within the transportation section of the policy, then Lloyd’s exposure
    was $500,000; if the Solways’ loss came within the warehouse section of the
    policy, Lloyd’s exposure was $1,000,000. The issue of which limit in the
    Lloyd’s policy applied to the Solways’ claim was thus the primary issue facing
    the application judge on the s. 132 hearing.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a>  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge, at paras. 30 and 31, neatly summed up the competing positions
    of the insurers and the task that he had to perform to resolve the dispute
    between them: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Lloyd’s position
    is that it was agreed as between insurer and insured (Kennedy) that any losses
    that occurred during a move, or during storage incidental to moving of up
    to ninety days’ duration, would be covered under the transportation section
    of the Lloyd’s’ Policy, with an applicable coverage limit of $500,000. The
    position of Allianz is that this claim does not fall under the transportation
    coverage provided in the policy, and thus the $500,000 limit does not apply.
    Instead, Allianz submits that the relevant policy limit is that specified
    under the policy’s warehouse and storage coverage, which is $1,000,000.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The task at
    hand, therefore, is to examine the Lloyd’s policy in order to determine which
    coverage responds to the Solways’ claim.</p>

      OF THE APPLICATION JUDGE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge first directed his attention to the clause of the policy
    entitled “SCOPE OF INSURANCE”. He did so with a view to determining whether
    the Solways’ claim fell within paragraphs 2A, 2B or 2C of that clause. In
    the end, he concluded that the claim and Kennedy’s rights to indemnity under
    the Lloyd’s policy arose under paragraph 2C. Given the centrality of this
    aspect of his reasons, both as to the outcome of the application and this
    appeal, I consider it necessary to reproduce in full the relevant passages
    from his reasons, commencing at para. 35 and concluding at para. 43:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Lloyd’s submits
    that the Solways' claim falls within Scope of Insurance 2A. It submits that
    the Solways' goods were property under a bill of lading and that the loss
    occurred while the goods were in storage incidental to transit for a period
    of less than 90 days. With respect to the limit of liability, Lloyd's submits
    that limit 4(a) is not applicable, because there was no amount of insurance
    or declared valuation agreed between Kennedy and the Solways. Rather, Lloyd’s
    submits that limit 4(b) applies, because it is a claim under Scope of Coverage
    2A. As a result, the policy limit applicable to Transportation Insurance
    ($500,000) governs.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
style='font-size:7.0pt'> </span>For its part, Allianz submits that the claim
    does not fall within paragraph 2A of the Scope of Insurance, because Kennedy
    did not agree to provide declared valuation protection. Similarly, Allianz
    submits, Coverage 2B is inapplicable, because Kennedy did not agree to provide
    insurance to protect the Solways' property while it was in storage. Instead,
    the argument continues, because it is outside 2A and 2B, the Solways' claim
    falls within Scope of Insurance 2C. The relevant policy limit is found in
    the General Conditions, paragraph 6, which references the limits of liability
    of the Transportation and Storage Sections. Since Kennedy's liability to
    the Solways was for breach of a storage agreement, the storage limit ($1,000,000)
    governs.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='
text-align:left'>The first point to determine, therefore, is whether Kennedy’s
    entitlement to payment under the Lloyd’s Policy falls within Scope of Insurance
    2A, 2B or 2C. As I noted early in these reasons, the Solways gave their goods
    to Kennedy pursuant to a bill of lading. That document contained the following
    provision (which was at the heart of the <i>Solway v. Kennedy </i>litigation):</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>Unless value
    is declared and additional protection is requested, carrier’s liability is
    limited to $0.60 per pound per article including contents. Whether such loss
    or damage is arising out of storage, transportation, packing, unpacking or
    handling. If additional protection is requested, the carrier’s liability
    is limited in the case of loss or damage of the entire shipment to the amount
    of the declared value. In the case of partial loss or damage, it will be
    limited to the portion of such loss and damage which such declared value
    bears to the true market value of the entire shipment.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>No declared
    valuation was inserted in the Solway bill of lading and the goods were released
    to Kennedy at a value of $0.60 per pound per article.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It may thus
    be seen that the Solway-Kennedy bill of lading did not include or provide
    for protection for the owner of the goods based upon a declared valuation.
    Lloyd’s submits, however, that the words “Declared Valuation Protection” in
    Scope of Insurance 2A apply only to the words “agreement under which the
    insured has agreed to provide Declared Valuation Protection” and do not apply
    to the words
    “Bill of Lading” in the opening phrase of that paragraph.  I disagree, for
    several reasons.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Firstly, the
    references to “Bill of Lading” and “Declared Valuation Protection” in Scope
    of Insurance 2A cannot be viewed in isolation. For example, in General Condition
    6
    – Valuation, the insurer's liability is limited to “the value declared in
    the applicable Bill of Lading”. This is consistent with the limit found in
    Limits of Liability paragraph 4(a), which is stated to be the “Declared Valuation
    agreed between the Insured and the Owner(s) of the Property Insured” for
    claims made under Scope of Insurance 2A. The scheme of the policy, therefore,
    contemplates that where the insured has agreed to provide declared valuation
    protection (which can be provided under a bill of lading, similar shipping
    document or other agreement) and a loss occurs, the insurer agrees to indemnify
    the insured for the amount of the declared valuation. To somehow isolate
    the opening phrase of paragraph 2A, as Lloyd’s submits, is illogical and
    inconsistent with the scheme of the policy. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Secondly, the
    interpretation for which Lloyd’s contends is a restrictive one. It conflicts
    with the principle that coverage provisions should be construed broadly,
    as well as the <i>contra proferentem</i> rule. From a grammatical point of
    view, the words “under which the Insured has agreed to provide Declared Valuation
    Protection” contained in paragraph 2A can fairly be read as referring to
    “property under a Bill of Lading, similar shipping document or agreement”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge concluded: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It follows that
    Coverage 2A is applicable to property under a bill of lading only where the
    insured has agreed to provide declared valuation protection. The Solway-Kennedy
    bill of lading did not provide for that protection. I therefore conclude
    Coverage 2A is inapplicable. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The coverage
    provided by Scope of Insurance 2B extends to “property under a Warehouse
    Receipt or similar document under which the Insured has agreed to provide
    insurance to protect the interest of the owner(s) of the Property Insured
    while in storage”. It is common ground that no warehouse receipt was provided
    nor did Kennedy agree to provide insurance to protect the Solways’ interest
    in their belongings. It follows that Coverage 2B is inapplicable. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Scope of Insurance
    paragraph 2C provided insurance to Kennedy for liability that might be imposed
    upon it by law as a private or common carrier or warehouseman, to the extent
    not provided under 2A or 2B. Liability has been imposed by the judgment of
    Himel J. Neither Coverage 2A nor Coverage 2B is applicable. It therefore
    follows that Kennedy's rights to indemnity under the Lloyd's Policy arise
    under Coverage 2C.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    found that Kennedy’s rights arose under paragraph 2C, the application judge
    next turned his attention to the issue of the applicable policy limit. He
    determined that there were two separate locations in the policy that addressed
    the insurance limits under “Coverage 3B – CUSTOMERS GOODS INSURANCE”:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I turn now to
    the policy limit issue. The insurance limits under Coverage 3B for Transportation
    and Storage are found in two locations. Firstly, paragraph 4 entitled “Limits
    of Liability” contains in separate sub-paragraphs limits for (a) “claims
    made under sub-paragraphs A and B of Scope of Insurance”; (b)
    “claims made under sub-paragraphs A and C combined&quot;; and (c) “claims
    made under sub-paragraphs B and C combined”.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Secondly, under
    General Condition 6 “Valuation” another limit of liability is expressed,
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
style='font-size:7.0pt'>&nbsp;</span>As respects claims made under paragraph
    C of Scope Of Insurance under this policy, the Insurer agrees to pay all
    sums for which the Insured is legally liable subject to the limits of liability
    of the Transportation and Storage Sections.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    identified two locations in the policy providing for the insurance limits
    under Coverage 3B for Transportation and Storage, the application judge considered
    the applicability of paragraphs 4(a), (b) and (c), found under the heading “LIMITS
    OF LIABILITY”, to determine if any of those paragraphs applied.  He concluded
    that none of them did, based on his earlier finding that Kennedy’s claim
    for indemnity for the Solways’ loss fell exclusively under paragraph 2C of
    the
    “SCOPE OF INSURANCE” provision:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='
text-align:left'>For the reasons previously expressed, Kennedy's claim for indemnity
    in respect of the Solway judgment does not fall within sub-paragraph 2A or
    sub-paragraph 2B of the Scope of Insurance; rather it falls exclusively under
    Coverage 2C. As such, limit of liability 4(a) is inapplicable. Since the
    Kennedy claim for indemnity is not combined with a claim under Coverage 2A
    or Coverage 2B, it is neither a claim made under sub-paragraphs 2A and 2C
    combined nor under sub-paragraphs 2B and 2C combined. As a result, the limits
    of liability expressed in paragraphs 4(b) and 4(c) have no application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    paragraphs 4(a), (b) and (c) off the table, the application judge found:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The only remaining
    limit of liability that could be applicable is the one contained in General
    Condition 6 and I conclude that it is.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regarding
    General Condition 6, the application judge stated that apart from situations “involving
    declared valuations or agreements by the insured to provide a specified amount
    of insurance” (neither of which existed here), the limits contemplated by
    the provision were “$500,000 for Transportation Insurance and $1,000,000
    for Warehouse Insurance.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge next posed the question whether a claim founded on a breach
    of a storage contract would be subject to the Warehouse Insurance limit.
    At para. 48, he answered that question in the affirmative:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Although the
    policy declarations specify $1,000,000 as the amount of “Warehouse Insurance”,
    Coverage 3B – “Customers Goods Insurance” is subtitled “Transportation &amp;
    Storage”. The term “storage” is also used in subparagraph 2B with reference
    to goods held by the insured under a warehouse receipt. It thus appears that
    the terms &quot;warehouse&quot; and “storage” are used in the policy interchangeably.
    I therefore conclude that a claim founded on a breach of a storage contract
    would be subject to the Warehouse Insurance limit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    his conclusion that a breach of a storage contract would be subject to the
    Warehouse Insurance limit, the application judge outlined what he viewed
    as the final determination to be made in deciding which of the two potential
    policy limits applied. He framed the issue as follows at para. 49:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The determination
    of which policy limit is applicable thus comes down to the proper characterization
    of the claim in respect of which Kennedy seeks indemnity under the policy,
    namely, the Solway Judgment. In turn, the Solway Judgment is founded upon
    the reasons for decision of Himel J.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge then quoted extensively from Himel&nbsp;J.’s reasons in
    the Solway/Kennedy action. In particular, he focused on her reasons for finding
    that Kennedy could not rely on Condition 5 in the bill of lading (the 60
    cents per pound limitation of liability clause) due to its failure to provide
    safe storage of the Solways’ goods as agreed upon. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge made the following critical findings at paras. 50 to 52
    of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=mainparagraph><i><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";'>It
        may thus be seen that the basis of the finding of liability imposed by
        Himel J. was a breach of the term of the contract between the Solways
        and Kennedy regarding the security to be provided while the goods were
        stored in the Kennedy trailer</span></i><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>. As such, liability was founded upon a breach of the parties' oral agreement
        concerning the storage of the Solways’ goods, and was not founded upon
        a breach of the contract for their transportation.</span></p>
  <p class=mainparagraph><i><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";'>In
        my opinion, by reason of the fact that liability was imposed upon Kennedy
        for breach of a contractual term relating to the storage of a customer's
        goods, the policy limit relating to claims arising from the transportation
        of customers’ goods is not applicable</span></i><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";'>.
        I am alert to the closing words in Scope of Insurance paragraph 2A, which
        refer to losses “while in storage incidental to transit for a period
        not exceeding 90 days”. Those words only come into play, however, for
        claims that fall within the scope of paragraph 2A. For reasons previously
        articulated paragraph 2A has no application to the present claim.</span></p>
  <p class=mainparagraph><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";'>I
      therefore conclude that the appropriate policy limit is that applicable
      to warehouse and storage claims. Pursuant to the policy declarations, the
      amount of Warehouse Insurance is $1,000,000. In my opinion that is the
      limit in the Lloyd's Policy that is applicable to the Solway claim  [emphasis
      added]. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    sum, the application judge concluded that the limit of $1,000,000 for warehouse
    insurance applied for two main reasons. First, he was satisfied that under
    the policy, the limits of liability were governed by General Condition 6
    (as argued by Allianz) and not paragraph 4(b) of the
    “LIMITS OF LIABILITY” provision (as argued by Lloyd’s).  That finding stemmed
    from his interpretation of the “SCOPE OF INSURANCE” clause and in particular,
    his conclusion that Kennedy’s claim for indemnity fell exclusively under
    paragraph 2C of that provision. Second, he was satisfied that Kennedy’s liability
    to the Solways stemmed from its failure to safely store their goods (<i>i.e., </i>for
    its breach of the safe storage contract as argued by Allianz) and not from
    its failure to deliver their goods (<i>i.e.,</i> for its breach of the transportation
    contract as argued by Lloyd’s).</p>

    with her reasons for refusing to permit Kennedy to rely on the limitation
    of liability clause in the bill of lading. As I pointed out earlier in these
    reasons, in the action before Himel J., Kennedy admitted liability for failing
    to deliver the Solways’ goods and Himel J. affirmed that concession at para.
    92 of her reasons where she stated:  “Under the terms of the contract, failure

    Kennedy with liability, but with what she characterized at para. 90 of her
    reasons as the central question: “whether the plaintiffs [Solways] must bear
    the loss because of a <i>limitation of liability clause in the contract</i> or
    whether the clause does not apply and the defendant [Kennedy] is responsible” [emphasis

    determining that issue against Kennedy, Himel J. was not fixing Kennedy with
    liability for having breached the terms of the “safe storage” contract (as

    for failing to deliver their goods (as Lloyd’s argued).</p>

    recognize that Himel J. concluded that there was an oral component to the
    contract, namely, that the Solways’ goods would be safely stored.  However,
    this aspect was incidental to the written terms of the contract for transporting
    the Solways’
    goods, as evidenced by the bill of lading. With respect, there can be no
    doubt about the basis of Himel J.’s finding of liability against Kennedy.
    Kennedy failed to deliver the goods in accordance with the terms of the bill
    of lading. That is a breach of a “transportation contract”, not a breach
    of the incidental oral term of the contract for safe storage.  Thus, even
    given the application judge’s conclusion that General Condition 6 governs
    the limits of liability, the breach that gave rise to liability was a transportation
    breach, not a storage breach. </p>

    begin my analysis with the observation that an insurance contract, like any
    other contract, should be construed in a manner that attempts to harmonize
    and make sense out of the various provisions contained in it, and does not
    strain them. Ambiguities are to be resolved in favour of the insured. But
    ambiguity does not exist whenever the policy contains wording that could
    be open to two or more reasonable interpretations. Before resorting to the <i>contra
    proferentem</i> principle, an effort should be made to interpret the policy
    in a commercially reasonable fashion and in a way that gives effect to the
    reasonable expectations of the parties. With respect, I believe that the
    application judge failed to apply those principles in his construction of
    the relevant provisions. (See John D. McCamus, <i>The Law of Contracts</i> (Toronto:  Irwin
    Law Inc., 2005) at pp. 717-24; <i>Consolidated - Bathurst Export Ltd. v.
    Mutual Boiler &amp; Machinery Insurance Co</i>., [1980] 1 S.C.R. 888 and <i>Reid

    seems to me that barring clear language to the contrary, it makes little
    commercial or practical sense to interpret paragraphs 2A, B and C, under
    the heading “SCOPE OF INSURANCE”, in a manner that fails to harmonize them
    with paragraphs 4(a), (b) and (c), under the heading “LIMITS OF LIABILITY”.   The
    application judge’s failure to harmonize the paragraphs of these two sections
    led to his reliance on General Condition 6, a condition that on its face
    has everything to do with valuation and nothing to do with limits of liability
    -- General Condition 6 appears under the heading “VALUATION”, not “LIMITS
    OF LIABILITY”. In my respectful view, by treating General Condition 6 as
    a limits of liability provision, the application judge effectively re-wrote
    the contract.  And he did so to fill in a gap of his own making.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is common ground that under the heading “SCOPE OF INSURANCE”, paragraph 2A
    relates to Transportation Insurance and paragraph 2B relates to Warehouse
    Insurance.  The question to be determined is how paragraph 2C fits into the
    scheme of things. Is it to be read in isolation from claims brought under
    paragraphs 2A and 2B, or is it to be incorporated into and read in conjunction
    with them?</p>

line-height:normal'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the answer lies in construing clause 2 in a manner that gives effect
    to the intention and reasonable expectations of the parties and that harmonizes
    this clause with the limitation of liability provisions in clause 4. When
    that is done, it seems apparent to me that paragraph 2C should be read in
    conjunction with paragraphs 2A and 2B, and not in isolation.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge saw the matter differently. He concluded that paragraph
    2A was not invoked in the instant case because in the bill of lading between
    Kennedy and the Solways, Kennedy did not agree to provide
    “Declared Valuation Protection” to the Solways.  In my view, he was correct
    in his interpretation of paragraph 2A to the extent that he concluded that
    the references to “Bill of Lading” and
    “Declared Valuation Protection” in 2A cannot be viewed in isolation.  In
    other words, contrary to Lloyd’s suggested interpretation of this paragraph,
    paragraph 2A does refer to property under a bill of lading under which the
    insured has agreed to provide declared valuation protection.</p>

    also found that paragraph 2B was not engaged because “no warehouse receipt

    in their belongings.”  Again, I agree with this part of his analysis. </p>

    application judge next turned his attention to the “policy limit issue” and
    in particular, to clause 4 under the heading “LIMITS OF LIABILITY”. He concluded
    that none of the three paragraphs in clause 4 applied because none of them
    referred to claims brought exclusively under paragraph 2C of the “Scope of
    Insurance” clause. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is here, in my respectful view, that the application judge fell into error.
    Clause 2 entitled “SCOPE OF INSURANCE” begins with the words,
    “The Insurer agrees to pay”. Those words modify each of paragraphs 2A, B
    and C.  Paragraphs 2A and B will apply where the amount for which the insurer
    agrees to indemnify the insured is specified: under paragraph 2A, it will
    be the amount of the “Declared Valuation Protection” that the insured has
    agreed to provide in respect of the property under a bill of lading, similar
    shipping document or agreement; under paragraph 2B, it will be the amount
    of insurance that the insured has agreed to provide under a warehouse receipt
    or a similar document, to protect the interest of the owner of the insured
    property while the property is in storage. Thus, when a claim is made exclusively
    under either of those paragraphs, the limit of Lloyd’s liability is known
    from the outset. It is the amount that Lloyd’s “has agreed to pay” and it
    dovetails with the limits of Lloyd’s liability under paragraph 4(a). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where,
    however, as in this case, the Insured has not agreed under the bill of lading
    to provide “Declared Valuation Protection”, paragraph 2C is engaged. The
    opening words of this paragraph read: “to the extent that <i>such</i> is
    not provided for under sub-paragraphs A or B above”
    [emphasis added].  In my view, the word
    “such” refers back to the opening words of clause 2 under the heading “SCOPE
    OF INSURANCE”:  “The Insurer agrees to pay”. And where “such” is not provided
    for in the bill of lading, it gets identified under paragraph 2C as “<i>all
    sums</i> which the Insured shall become obligated to pay by reason of the
    liability imposed by law upon, or assumed under agreement by, the Insured
    as a private or common carrier or warehouseman” [emphasis added].<i></i></p>

line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Viewed
    that way, for purposes of interpreting the limits of Lloyd’s liability under
    clause 4, I see no impediment to reading paragraph 2C in conjunction with
    paragraph 2A where the Insured has not agreed to provide “Declared Valuation
    Protection” under a bill of lading or other similar shipping document or
    agreement. Indeed, on the facts of this case, I believe that 2C and 2A fit
    comfortably together. <i></i></p>

    Solways contracted with Kennedy under a bill of lading to transport their
    goods to their new home. The goods were lost (stolen) while in storage incidental
    to transit for a period of less than 90 days, as contemplated in paragraph
    2A. Under the bill of lading, Kennedy did not agree to provide “Declared
    Valuation Protection”. Thus, the sum that Kennedy was obligated to pay fell
    to be determined under paragraph 2C. That is where the Kennedy/Solway action
    before Himel J. comes in.<i></i></p>

    battle before Himel J. was, in effect, to determine how much the sum under
    paragraph 2C would be. Kennedy argued that it should be 60 cents per pound
    according to the liability imposed on it by law (Reg. 1088, <i>Truck Transportation
    Act</i>, <i>supra</i>) or under its agreement with the Solways (60 cents
    per pound under Condition 5 of the bill of lading). The Solways maintained
    that it should be the replacement value of the goods. Himel J. agreed with
    the Solways.<i></i></p>

    application judge was called upon to determine the limits of Lloyd’s liability
    in those circumstances. In my view, paragraph 4(b) under the heading “LIMITS
    OF LIABILITY” was tailor-made for the situation. The Solways’ claim was a
    claim made under a combination of paragraphs 2A and 2C. As such, the extent
    of Lloyd’s liability is $500,000, which is the specified limit for Transportation
    Insurance in any one occurrence.<i></i></p>

    the paragraphs in clause 2 in this way harmonizes it with the “LIMITS OF
    LIABILITY” provision contained in clause 4. This construction also pays heed
    to the intentions and reasonable expectations of the parties. In that regard,
    surely Kennedy and Lloyd’s would have expected that the limit of Lloyd’s
    liability for occurrences identified in paragraphs 2A, B and C would be located
    in the “LIMITS OF LIABILITY” provision, especially when that provision is
    contained in the same section of the policy and specifically identifies claims
    under paragraphs 2A, B and C. What they would not reasonably expect, in my
    view, is that the limit of liability would be located in a general provision
    of the policy (General Condition 6) that was meant to deal with the value
    of a claim, not the limits of Lloyd’s liability. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    concluding that paragraph 4(b) is the operative limitation of liability clause
    in this case, I recognize that an argument could also be made that paragraph
    4(c) should apply<i> </i>and thus the Solways’
    claim should be viewed as a claim under paragraphs 2B and 2C combined.  The
    argument would be that the Solways’
    goods were stored when stolen, as contemplated in paragraph 2B, and the amount
    of Kennedy’s liability was to be determined under 2C. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    in my view, that argument is too great a stretch. There was no warehouse
    receipt here; rather, there was a bill of lading that called for Kennedy
    to deliver the Solways’ goods. Kennedy did not comply.  The Solways’ goods
    were stolen while in storage incidental to transit for a period of less than
    90 days. Kennedy was found liable to the Solways under the bill of lading
    for failure to deliver their goods, not for failing to store them safely.
    The failure to safely store the goods resulted in a judicial determination
    that Kennedy was not entitled to rely on the clause limiting its liability
    to 60 cents per pound, as found in the bill of lading. The enhanced sum was
    the sum that Kennedy became obligated by law to pay to the Solways for its
    failure to deliver their goods. The situation here is precisely the one envisaged
    by clause 4(b) under the heading “LIMITS OF LIABILITY”. <i></i></p>

    Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;43, post-judgment interest
    accrues automatically unless the court exercises its discretion under s.

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In the absence
    of any express contractual provision, I can see no good reason for post-judgment
    interest to be included within the policy limit. This can be illustrated
    by positing the situation where a judgment is granted against an insured
    for an amount equal to or greater than the policy limit. In such a situation,
    if post-judgment interest was included in the policy limit the insurer could
    (theoretically) delay payment with virtual impunity by, for example, prosecuting
    an unmeritorious appeal, since its exposure to its insured would be capped
    at the policy limit. Meanwhile, post-judgment interest would continue to
    accrue. In light of the insured's obligation to pay post-judgment interest
    once a claim has been crystallized into a judgment, it makes sense to impose
    a like obligation on the insurer, regardless of the policy limit.</p>

    provisions in the policy under the heading “GENERAL CONDITIONS”. They state:<u></u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <u>DEFENCE COSTS</u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The Insurer
    further agrees to defend in the name and on behalf of the Insured and at
    the cost of the Insurer any civil action which may at any time be brought
    against the Insured on account of such property damage, which costs shall
    be in addition to the applicable limit of liability stated elsewhere herein.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <u>ADMISSION OF LIABILITY AND ACTION</u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(a)&nbsp;The

    amount without prior reference to the Insurer.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The insured
    shall not otherwise admit any liability and as respects claims under C of
    Scope Of Insurance the Insurer hereby reserves the right to compromise or
    contest at its option, on behalf of and in the name of, but with no expense
    to the Insured, any and all claims made against the Insured in respect of
    liability covered by this Policy.</p>

line-height:normal'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    setting out the relevant provisions, the application judge noted that in
    the present case, Lloyd’s elected to defend the Solway action. As a result
    of that unsuccessful defence, on top of Kennedy’s liability to the Solways
    for damages and pre-judgment interest on that sum, Kennedy was exposed to
    an adverse costs award of more than $110,000. In rejecting the submission
    that those costs should be included in the policy limit, the application
    judge stated at paras. 61 to 63:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Applying the
    principles of broad construction of coverage provisions, narrow construction
    of exclusion clauses and the <i>contra proferentem</i> rule, I conclude that
    the correct interpretation of the words &quot;with no expense to the Insured&quot;
    in General Condition 3 is that the insured is not to be called upon to bear
    any expense arising from the defence of a claim, whether payable to its own
    solicitors or to the opposite party. It is well known that, almost invariably,
    one of the expenses involved in litigation is that incurred by an unsuccessful
    party who is ordered to pay costs to a successful adversary. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I acknowledge
    that in another portion of the policy [in the Commercial General Liability
    portion of the policy] the insurer chose to address this topic with more
    specific language. That provision, however, related to different coverage.
    In relation to the coverage that is responsive to the Solways' claim against
    Kennedy, however, the court must have regard to the language that the insurer
    chose to include as part of the general conditions applicable to this specific
    coverage. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Since I have
    concluded that the costs of defending the Solway Action, including any award
    of costs made by the court in favour of the Solways ought not be borne by
    Kennedy, it follows that it is my opinion that any costs awarded against
    Kennedy and in favour of the Solways should be excluded from the policy limit. </p>
