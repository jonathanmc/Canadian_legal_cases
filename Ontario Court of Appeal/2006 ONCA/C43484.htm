style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant seeks judicial review of the May 2, 2005 order of the Minister
    of Justice in which he ordered the surrender of the applicant to the United
    States of America on the allegation of two counts of interference with custody.  These
    charges arose from the applicant’s decision to remove two of her children
    from the United States contrary to a Tennessee court order that awarded custody
    of these two children to the applicant’s former husband and forbade her from
    taking the children out of the United States.  The applicant brought the
    children to Brantford, Ontario, her former home before her marriage.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    early March 2003, the applicant was indicted in the Limestone County Circuit
    Court for the 39<sup>th</sup> Judicial Circuit of the State of Alabama on
    two counts of interference with custody.  Thereafter, the United States
    sought her extradition to Alabama.</p>

    March&nbsp;17,&nbsp;2003, the applicant was arrested under a provisional
    warrant issued in accordance with the <i>Extradition Act</i>, S.C. 1999,
    c.&nbsp;18.  She was released on bail.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    June 9, 2003, the Minister of Justice authorized the Attorney General of
    Canada to seek an order for the committal of the applicant on the Canadian
    offences corresponding to the U.S. charges, namely, abduction of her two
    children in contravention of a custody order.  On June 7, 2004, the applicant
    consented to committal on these offences.  She was again released on bail
    pending the determination of the Minister.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her application for judicial review, the applicant attacks the Minister’s
    order on two broad grounds:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>(1)       the Minister erred by
    concluding that the requirement of double criminality was satisfied; and</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>(2)       the Minister erred in
    not exercising his discretion to refuse surrender because such an order would
    be unjust or oppressive or would offend the applicant’s rights under s.&nbsp;7
    of the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    way of preliminary comment, we observe that both the Supreme Court of Canada
    and this court have repeatedly held that ministerial decisions in the extradition
    domain are entitled to substantial deference in a judicial review context:  see <i>Schmidt
    v. The Queen</i> (1987), 33 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.); <i>Argentina (Republic)
    v. Mellino</i> (1987), 33 C.C.C. (3d) 334 (S.C.C.); and <i>United States
    of America v. Whitley</i> (1994), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 99 (Ont. C.A.)  <i>Whitley</i> was
    affirmed in a one line endorsement: [1996] 1 S.C.R. 467.  Recently, in <i>Canada
    (Minister of Justice) v. Thomson</i>, 2005 CanL II 5078 at para.&nbsp;10,
    this court summarized the restrictions on its review of a Minister’s surrender
    decision in this fashion:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The standard of review of the Minister's surrender
    order is found in s. 57 of the <i>Extradition Act</i>.  This has been repeatedly
    stated as being limited to cases of real substance; review must be exercised
    with the utmost circumspection; and judicial interference must be limited: <i>United
    States v. Whitley</i> (1994), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 99 (Ont. C.A.).  Deference is
    to be given to the factual analysis and decisions of the Minister.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the double criminality issue, the Minister stated in his decision:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The double criminality was determined to have been
    met when the extradition judge committed Ms.&nbsp;Staats on the offences
    listed in the Authority to Proceed, namely the Canadian offence of abduction
    in contravention of custody order, contrary to section&nbsp;282 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Double criminality is met when the alleged conduct
    that underlies the foreign charge constitutes any extradition crime under
    the law of Canada (<i>United States v. McVey</i>, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 475 and <i>United
    States v. Commisso</i> (2000), 47 O.R. (3d) 257 (C.A.)).  What Ms.&nbsp;Staats
    admitted before an extradition judge, is that the conduct alleged against
    her by the State of Alabama, namely removing her children Amy and Dustin
    from the United States of America in violation of the Alabama custody order,
    would support a committal for trial in Canada, had she been charged with
    the Canadian offence of abduction in contravention of a custody order, contrary
    to section 282 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Consequently, Ms.&nbsp;Staats
    would have to stand trial in Canada if accused of an offence under section&nbsp;282
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, even if she were able to raise section&nbsp;285
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i> as a defence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, the fact that section&nbsp;285 of the <i>Criminal
      Code </i>affords a codified defence of qualified necessity to an offence
      under section&nbsp;282 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>(<i>R. v. Adam</i> (1993),
      79 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (Ont. C.A.)), does not affect the double criminality
      of the conduct at issue.  It is the conduct underlying the foreign charge
      and not the defences to it that is relevant.  A successful defence of necessity
      does not mean that the acts were not wrongful, rather it excuses the accused’s
      conduct because of “moral or normative involuntariness” (<i>R. v. Perka</i> (1984),
      14 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.)).  The consideration of the codified defence
      of qualified necessity available to her under section&nbsp;285 of the <i>Criminal
      Code</i>, is not a relevant consideration in determining whether the conduct
      alleged against her constitutes an offence punishable by the laws of both
      the United States of America and Canada.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant asserts that there are two errors in the Minister’s analysis: (1)
    he improperly rubber&#8209;stamped the decision of the extradition judge
    on the double criminality issue; and (2) he was wrong in saying that potential
    defences are not relevant in assessing this issue.  We disagree.  In our
    view, the Minister’s analysis on both components of this issue is legally
    correct.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the first component, we see no reason why a Minister, having issued an Authority
    to Proceed in relation to the Canadian offences, cannot consider, and adopt,
    the extradition judge’s conclusion that the double criminality requirement
    for extradition has been established.  As was explained by Dambrot&nbsp;J.
    in <i>United States of America v. Drysdale</i> (2000), 71 C.R.R. (2d) 133
    (Ont. S.C.J.), it is the task of the Minister to determine compliance with
    s.&nbsp;3(1)(a) of the <i>Extradition Act, </i>and s.&nbsp;3(3) where applicable,
    and then to determine what offences under Canadian law correspond to the
    conduct alleged in the requesting state.  It is then the task of the extradition
    judge to assess the sufficiency of the evidence.  Once these two functions
    have been performed and the extradition judge has committed the person sought,
    the test for double criminality has been satisfied.  Accordingly, the Minister
    made no error in saying that double criminality was met when the extradition
    judge committed Ms.&nbsp;Staats on the offences listed in the Authority to
    Proceed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the second component of the double criminality issue, the Minister’s conclusion
    that “[i]t is the conduct underlying the foreign charge and not the defences
    to it that is relevant” is, in our view, entirely consistent with the case
    law: see <i>Canada v. Schmidt</i>, <i>supra</i>, and <i>United States of
    America v. Adam</i> (2001), 151 O.A.C. 70 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning
    to the applicant’s second issue, she contends that the surrender order is
    unjust and oppressive and violates her rights under s.&nbsp;7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  The
    foundations for this submission are the applicant’s evidence that she removed
    the children in order to protect them from their father and the existence
    in Canada of s.&nbsp;285 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, which provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>285. No one shall be found guilty of an offence
    under sections 280 to 283 if the court is satisfied that the taking, enticing
    away, concealing, detaining, receiving or harbouring of any young person
    was necessary to protect the young person from danger of imminent harm or
    if the person charged with the offence was escaping from danger of imminent
    harm.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>The applicant maintains that there
    is no equivalent to this defence in Alabama and, therefore, she should not
    be surrendered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Minister dealt with this submission in his decision.  He had before him information
    about Alabama law and determined that there were analogues to s.&nbsp;285
    in Alabama.  This conclusion was not unreasonable, let alone patently unreasonable.  The
    Minister concluded: “Ms.&nbsp;Staats may raise the Alabama excuse of necessity
    and defence of duress before the trial court in Alabama.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    in support of her <i>Charter</i> argument, the applicant argues that the
    Minister impermissibly fettered his discretion to decline to order her surrender
    by requiring that her surrender must “shock the conscience” in order to support
    a violation of her s.&nbsp;7 rights.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, this misconceives the Minister’s decision.  It is apparent from
    the Minister’s reasons, notwithstanding his single reference to the expression “shocks
    the conscience”, that he was aware that he was obliged to determine whether
    the applicant’s surrender would be contrary to the principles of natural
    justice.  We, therefore, reject this argument.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, we see nothing on the record in this case to warrant our interference
    with the Minister’s analysis or conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application is dismissed.</p>
