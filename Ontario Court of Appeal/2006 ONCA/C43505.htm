      of Justice J.A. Roy of the Superior Court of Justice dated April 13, 2005.</span></h4>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellants are the purchasers and the respondent is the vendor under a
      written agreement of purchase and sale of the vendor’s property.  The vendor
      refused to complete the transaction and the purchasers commenced an action
      for a declaration that the agreement was binding and for specific performance.   After
      a trial, Mr. Justice Roy dismissed the action on the basis that the parties
      were not <i>ad idem</i>, with costs in favour of the vendor.  For the reasons
      that follow, we would allow the appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      purchasers had indicated to the vendor that they were interested in buying
      the property.  Later they were invited by the vendor to come and visit
      the property.  Discussions and negotiations for the transaction took place
      between the parties over a period of two days.  The purchaser Ball prepared
      two copies of a hand written agreement of purchase and sale and the vendor
      Hardy participated in the preparation of the agreement by providing the
      necessary documents for the drafting of the agreement.  The parties signed
      the agreement and each retained a copy of the executed document.   A deposit
      was accepted by the vendor which was to be held in trust by a lawyer pending
      completion of the transaction.  The parties agreed to attend on the lawyer
      the next day to proceed with the transaction.  </span></p>

      the next day, the vendor advised the purchasers that she was not going
      to the lawyer and needed more time to think about the sale.  Later, she
      advised that she was not prepared to proceed to the transaction. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      trial judge found that the agreement contained all the essential terms
      for a valid agreement of purchase and sale and that the unique nature and
      quality of the property warranted the remedy of specific performance.  He
      found that all the parties were credible.  He also found that there was
      no undue influence or duress by the appellants on the vendor and that the
      agreement was not unconscionable.  He found that the sale price was reasonable.  </span></p>

      the trial judge arrived at the conclusion not to enforce the agreement.  In
      so doing, he appears to have relied upon a lack of <i>consensus ad idem</i> and
      the defences of mistake, <i>non est factum</i> and unconscionable conduct
      due to inequality of bargaining power.  </span></p>

      vendor is a literate and educated woman with no physical or mental condition
      that would interfere with her ability to enter into a valid agreement.  While
      the circumstance of negotiating and entering into a handwritten agreement
      of the sale of land without the involvement of a real estate agent or a
      lawyer is certainly unusual, there was no evidence that the vendor did
      not understand the nature of the document she was signing.  While there
      was some evidence given in her cross examination that the vendor may have
      thought that the agreement would not be binding until the parties had seen
      a lawyer, the evidence is clear that she knew that the purchasers thought
      that they had bought the property.  She did nothing at the time to suggest
      the contrary.    </span></p>

        v. Landstock Investments Ltd.</i>, [1976] 72 D.L.R. (3d) 195 (Ont. C.A.),
        Houlden J.A., speaking for this Court, in dealing with a contract of
        the sale of land, stated:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>                  </span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge found that the plaintiff did not accept the defendant’s counter-offer,
      and hence there was no binding contract between the parties.  With respect,
      I cannot agree with this finding.  On October 17<sup>th</sup>, when the
      plaintiff initialed the changes in the counter-offer, I think that a binding
      contract was entered into between the parties.  <i>Mutual assent is not
      required for the formation of a valid contract, only a manifestation of
      mutual assent: Restatement of the Law of Contract (1932), vol. 1, 20, p.25.  Whether
      or not there is a manifestation of mutual assent is to be determined from
      the overt acts of the parties: Williston, Treatise on the Law of Contracts,
      3<sup>rd</sup> ed. (1957), 22, p. 46 et seq., and Lindsey v. Heron &amp; Co.
      50 O.L.R. 1 at p. 8, 64 D.L.R. 92 at pp. 98-9, per Middleton J.  When the
      overt acts of the parties are examined, I think it is relevant that there
      was a manifestation of mutual assent in this case. </i>[Emphasis added.]<i> </i></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>These
      words are applicable to the present case.  Unquestionably, the written
      agreement was a manifestation of mutual assent for the sale of the property.  The
      trial judge’s conclusion not to enforce the agreement is contrary to his
      findings of fact and is not supported by the evidence.  None of the defences
      referred to above were available in the circumstances of this case.  Specifically,
      the facts of this case do not support a defence of mistake. The vendor
      did not communicate any reservation or misunderstanding that she may have
      had to the purchasers and it appears that she simply changed her mind after
      the execution of a valid and enforceable agreement of purchase and sale.  Although
      this is most unfortunate for the vendor, the purchasers are entitled to
      enforce the agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appeal is allowed.  The judgment is set aside and an order for specific
      performance of the Agreement of Purchase and Sale will issue.  We leave
      it to the parties to work out the mechanics of the sale.  Should there
      be a problem, we may be spoken to Costs of the trial and of this appeal
      to the appellants in the amount of $10,000 all inclusive.</span></p>
