      a hearing before this panel on December 1, 2005, the appellants were successful
      in setting aside three orders that (1) did not allow the appellant Cavalieri,
      as the sole shareholder of the plaintiff numbered company, to represent
      the company in the litigation; (2) ordered security for costs against Cavalieri;
      and (3) dismissed the application. When the court read its endorsement,
      counsel for the appellants asked for costs of the appeal. Counsel for the
      respondent objected on the basis that counsel for the appellant was acting <i>pro
      bono</i>, through the auspices of the Advocates’ Society <i>pro bono</i> program.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>      The
      costs issue raised is whether, in a private action that does not involve
      public law, the <i>Charter</i> or similar issues of general public importance,
      the court can or should make costs orders in favour of a party represented
      by counsel acting <i>pro bono</i>. Because of the significance of the issue
      to the legal profession and the public, the court adjourned the costs issue
      and invited representatives of the profession to act as <i>amici curiae</i>.
      These <i>amici</i> submitted briefs and made oral submissions advising
      the court on the policy considerations that inform the issue, as well as
      the positions taken by the profession.</span></p>

  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span
lang=EN-US>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>      Is <i>pro

'><span
lang=EN-US>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>      Is

'><span
lang=EN-US>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>      Is

  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>POSITIONS

line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>      Mr.
      Rosenstein of Pape Barristers acted <i>pro bono</i> on the appeal on behalf
      of the appellants, and was successful in setting aside the default judgment
      and order for security for costs, the breach of which led to the dismissal
      of the application. He also obtained an order allowing Mr.&nbsp;Cavalieri,
      the sole shareholder of the numbered company, to represent his company
      in the litigation. He asked for costs of the appeal fixed in the amount
      of $4,500. Based on his bill of costs, that amount represents a substantial
      reduction from a partial indemnity award. His position is that there is
      no reason why <i>pro bono</i> counsel should be denied their costs, and
      that recent case law and the principles in s. 131 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>,
      R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;C.43 and Rule 57 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>,
      R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194 support this submission.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>      Mr.
      Dallal on behalf of the respondents opposed the request for costs. He provided
      detailed written submissions following the original hearing for the purpose
      of allowing the court to consider all sides of the issue. He also presented
      a practical compromise submission if costs were to be awarded in this case. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>      His
      first position is that where lawyers agree to act <i>pro bono</i>, they
      have no expectation of payment. They are making a contribution to the administration
      of justice as part of their professional obligation as lawyers, again in
      the best tradition of the bar. Therefore, the potential for a costs award
      is contrary to the concept of acting <i>pro bono</i>. I add at this point
      the question whether, if costs are available, counsel considering a <i>pro
      bono</i> retainer may factor into their decision the potential for the
      recovery of costs.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>      Mr.
      Dallal also submits that in the “loser pay” costs regime, a party represented
      by <i>pro bono</i> counsel needs no indemnification from the losing party
      for legal fees incurred because that party is not paying counsel. This
      case, an ordinary commercial dispute, can be distinguished from recent
      case law that has allowed costs in favour of <i>pro bono</i> counsel acting
      in <i>Charter</i> cases, where there is a significant public interest component
      to the subject of the litigation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>      Although
      there are other purposes to an award of costs besides indemnification,
      specifically to encourage settlement, prevent frivolous or vexatious litigation
      and to discourage unnecessary steps, in cases such as this one, the playing
      field is not level. The impecunious party has an effective immunity from
      paying costs ordered in interlocutory matters and at the conclusion of
      the case.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A
      further argument is that if costs are to be awarded, then the financial
      terms of the retainer of the <i>pro bono</i> lawyer should be disclosed,
      including whether there is indemnity from another source or any contingency
      fee arrangement. An anomalous situation is created if the only parties
      with an interest in litigating the issue of costs are the <i>pro bono</i> lawyer
      and the losing party.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally,
      Mr. Dallal submits in the alternative, that the court should make all costs
      of interlocutory proceedings payable only at the end of the litigation
      rather than forthwith, because only the non-<i>pro bono </i>party would
      be able to pay forthwith. He suggests that this resolution will have two
      advantages. First, it will discourage interlocutory motions and create
      a more level playing field for the balance of the litigation. Second, it
      will prevent the problematic situation in which costs are awarded forthwith
      against a <i>pro bono</i> litigant who is unable to pay, entitling the
      opposing party to seek security for costs and ultimately, when such security
      cannot be paid, dismissal of the application.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      the alternative submission, Mr. Rosenstein responded in his written reply
      submission that the proper way to deal with a party unable to satisfy interlocutory
      costs orders is under rule 56.01(1)(c), security for costs.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i><span lang=EN-US>Amicus
        curiae</span></i><span lang=EN-US> briefs were filed and oral representations
        made on behalf of three legal organizations with a special interest in
        advocacy issues: the Ontario Trial Lawyers Association, <i>Pro Bono</i> Law
        Ontario and The Advocates’ Society. In response to the issues raised,
        all three refer to the noble tradition of the bar to take on cases without
        remuneration when the need of a potential litigant comes to its attention.
        This tradition was discussed by Major J. in a speech titled “Lawyers’ Obligation
        to Provide Legal Services” delivered to the National Conference on the
        Legal Profession and Professional Ethics at the University of Calgary
        in 1994 (33 Alta. L. Rev. 719) where he said:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>It has long been part of the duty and tradition of the legal profession
      to provide services gratuitously for those who require them but cannot
      afford them. The profession, recognizing its commitment to the larger principle
      of justice, has traditionally not let such cases go unanswered merely because
      the individual is impecunious. Instead, the profession has collectively
      accepted the burden of such cases, thereby championing the cause of justice
      while at the same time, sharing the cost that such cases entail. This is
      a tradition which dates to the very inception of the profession in medieval
      Europe in the thirteenth century.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>All <i>amici</i> submit,
      however, that it is not inappropriate for counsel who volunteer to act<i> pro
      bono</i> to be able to be reimbursed for their services to some extent
      by costs awards. They also agree that the potential for such awards would
      encourage more lawyers to take on <i>pro bono</i> cases and thereby increase
      access to justice for many people in Ontario.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Ontario Trial Lawyers Association also adopts the view that the purposes
      of costs awards in litigation other than indemnity apply equally to cases
      where a party is represented by <i>pro bono</i> counsel. It is therefore
      inappropriate to remove from the process the potential sanction of a costs
      order to promote settlement, to prevent litigants from causing needless
      delays and to allow the court to control its process.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i><span lang=EN-US>Pro
        Bono</span></i><span
lang=EN-US> Law Ontario (“PBLO”) takes a somewhat more radical position. Established
        in 2002, its mission statement is:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>To improve access
    to justice by providing strategic guidance, training and tailored technical
    assistance to law firms, law associations, legal departments and other groups
    that are dedicated to addressing the legal needs of low income and disadvantaged
    individuals as well as the communities and charitable organizations that
    serve them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>PBLO
    works to promote a <i>pro bono</i> culture within the legal profession by
    developing and enhancing the <i>pro bono</i> capacity of the bar. Lawyers
    have an obligation to ensure that everyone who needs it has access to justice,
    and acting “<i>pro bono publico</i>”, in the public good, helps to fulfill
    that objective. <i>Pro bono</i> legal services are offered without the expectation
    of payment to people who cannot afford a lawyer, in order to increase access
    to justice. The underlying charitable motivation distinguishes <i>pro bono </i>work
    from contingency fee or class action arrangements. However, because some
    lawyers are not in a position to absorb the financial obligations attached
    to <i>pro bono</i> work easily, the court’s recognition of the potential
    for costs awards may allow or encourage more lawyers to offer their services.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    position of PBLO is that there should be no special rule either for or against
    costs where parties are represented by <i>pro bono</i> counsel. In some cases, <i>pro
    bono</i> counsel may choose not to seek costs or may elect to donate any
    costs received to charity. However, because costs serve several normative
    functions within the litigation process, it is important that the court retain
    its discretion to make costs orders to control its own process and ensure
    that the system works fairly. To that end, the court should recognize access
    to justice as a fifth purpose underlying an award of costs that will be particularly
    relevant in <i>pro bono</i> cases. In that context, other costs remedies
    such as security for costs orders should be equally available to defendants
    with <i>pro bono</i> counsel who are sued, for example, by an impecunious
    plaintiff. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    where a party represented by <i>pro bono</i> counsel is unsuccessful, PBLO
    suggests that access to justice considerations may weigh against making a
    costs award against that party. The fear of such an adverse costs award may
    deter parties with limited means from litigating issues that are legitimately
    important to them. On the other hand, PBLO recognizes that other considerations
    in the specific litigation may lead the court to conclude that an adverse
    costs award is appropriate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the issue before the court involves private litigation, PBLO also refers
    to cases such as <i>Charter</i> litigation, which seek to advance the public
    interest.  In public interest cases, there is more reason for a court to
    avoid penalizing the <i>pro bono</i> litigant. It may even be appropriate
    for the court to grant costs, or at least disbursements, to an unsuccessful <i>pro
    bono</i> party. In England, for example, there is a limited practice of granting “pre-emptive
    costs orders” or “protective costs orders” (“PCO”s) in public interest cases
    where the applicant has no private interest in the case. In <i>R (on the
    application of Corner House Research) v. Secretary of State for Trade and
    Industry,</i> [2005] All E.R. 1<i>,</i> the English Court of Appeal explained
    these orders as follows at para.&nbsp;6:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The general
    purpose of a PCO is to allow a claimant of limited means access to the court
    in order to advance his case without the fear of an order for substantial
    costs being made against him, a fear which would inhibit him from continuing
    with the case at all.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>PBLO
    concludes its submissions by suggesting that the court should develop criteria
    for awarding or denying costs in <i>pro bono</i> cases on a case-by-case
    basis that will serve the traditional purposes of costs awards, but also
    reflect an overriding concern for access to justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I mentioned earlier, The Advocates’ Society’s position is that it is not
    inconsistent with the charitable objective of taking on <i>pro bono</i> work
    that counsel be able to request and accept an award of costs, if successful.
    The Society points out that it would be a windfall in the context of our “loser
    pay” system, for an unsuccessful party to avoid paying costs just because
    the opposite party is represented by <i>pro bono</i> counsel. Or, looking
    at the issue another way, in some cases, it will be appropriate for the unsuccessful

    the other hand, there could be cases where a costs order ought not to be
    made. One such case may be where the <i>pro bono</i> party would not have
    been able to pay costs if unsuccessful, and would not have expected to do
    so. The Society’s view is that this may be a relevant consideration for the

    the purpose of an award of costs within our
    “loser pay” system was to partially or, in some limited circumstances, wholly
    indemnify the winning party for the legal costs it incurred. However, costs
    have more recently come to be recognized as an important tool in the hands
    of the court to influence the way the parties conduct themselves and to prevent
    abuse of the court’s process. Specifically, the three other recognized purposes
    of costs awards are to encourage settlement, to deter frivolous actions and
    defences, and to discourage unnecessary steps that unduly prolong the litigation.

      Columbia (Minister of Forests) v. Okanagan Indian Band</i>, [2003] 3 S.C.R.
      371 at paras. 25 and 26, LeBel J. discussed the natural evolution of the
      law in recognizing these policy objectives:<i></i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>As the <i>Fellowes</i> and <i>Skidmore</i> [<i>infra</i>]
    cases illustrate, modern costs rules accomplish various purposes in addition
    to the traditional objective of indemnification. An order as to costs may
    be designed to penalize a party who has refused a reasonable settlement offer[.] … Costs
    can also be used to sanction behaviour that increases the duration and expense
    of litigation, or is otherwise unreasonable or vexatious. In short, it has
    become a routine matter for courts to employ the power to order costs as
    a tool in the furtherance of the efficient and orderly administration of
    justice.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Indeed, the
    traditional approach to costs can also be viewed as being animated by the
    broad concern to ensure that the justice system works fairly and efficiently.
    Because costs awards transfer some of the winner’s litigation expenses to
    the loser rather than leaving each party’s expenses where they fall (as is
    done in jurisdictions without costs rules), they act as a disincentive to
    those who might be tempted to harass others with meritless claims. And because
    they offset to some extent the outlays incurred by the winner, they make
    the legal system more accessible to litigants who seek to vindicate a legally
    sound position. These effects of the traditional rules can be connected to
    the court’s concern with overseeing its own process and ensuring that litigation
    is conducted in an efficient and just manner. In this sense it is a natural
    evolution in the law to recognize the related policy objectives that are
    served by the modern approach to costs.</p>

line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    part of the recognition that costs serve a purpose beyond indemnification,
    the courts began to award costs in favour of litigants who were traditionally
    viewed as disentitled to costs.  For example, costs have been awarded in
    cases where the litigant was self-represented (<i>Skidmore v. Blackmore</i> (1995),
    2 B.C.L.R. (3d) 201 (C.A.) and <i>Fong v. Chan</i> (1999), 46 O.R. (3d) 330
    (C.A.)); where the winning party was a law firm represented by one of its
    partners who was not charging fees (<i>Fellowes, McNeil supra</i>); where
    counsel was salaried (<i>Solicitors Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.15, s. 36);
    and, where the responsibility for a party’s legal fees was undertaken by
    a third party (<i>Re Lavigne and Ontario Public Service Employees Union et
    al (No.2)</i> (1987), 60 O.R. (2d) 486 (H.C.J.)).</p>

line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs
    have also been awarded to counsel acting <i>pro bono</i> in <i>Charter</i> or
    public interest cases such as <i>Rogers v. Sudbury (Administrator of Ontario
    Works)</i> (2001), 57 O.R. (3d) 467 (S.C.J.). In that case, Epstein J. awarded
    costs payable forthwith on an injunction application. She stated at para.
    21:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Through granting,
    when appropriate, cost awards payable forthwith during the course of what
    is frequently protracted litigation, the financial burden assumed by the
    lawyers doing <i>pro bono</i> work is reduced. Orders of this nature would
    allow more lawyers to accept this kind of retainer thereby increasing the
    opportunity for people, such as Ms. Rogers, to have access to justice. As
    well, applicants who may suffer irreparable harm as a result of the application
    of a law that is the subject of a legitimate <i>Charter</i> challenge have
    increased opportunity to seek interlocutory relief since counsel acting for
    them have a chance of being paid promptly for the often very expensive process
    of preparing for and arguing a motion for an interlocutory injunction.</p>

    appropriate litigation strategies. However, an award of costs in favour of
    a successful <i>pro bono</i> party will not always be appropriate. For example,

    on an award of costs in favour of <i>pro bono </i>counsel in appropriate
    cases. Although the original concept of acting on a <i>pro bono</i> basis
    meant that the lawyer was volunteering his or her time with no expectation
    of any reimbursement, the law now recognizes that costs awards may serve
    purposes other than indemnity. To be clear, it is neither inappropriate,
    nor does it derogate from the charitable purpose of volunteerism, for counsel
    who have agreed to act <i>pro bono</i> to receive some reimbursement for

    (1) it ensures that both the non-<i>pro bono</i> party and the <i>pro bono</i> party
    know that they are not free to abuse the system without fear of the sanction
    of an award of costs; and (2) it promotes access to justice by enabling and
    encouraging more lawyers to volunteer to work <i>pro bono</i> in deserving
    cases. Because the potential merit of the case will already factor into whether
    a lawyer agrees to act <i>pro bono</i>, there is no anticipation that the
    potential for costs awards will cause lawyers to agree to act only in cases
    where they anticipate a costs award. </p>

    issue of the costs obligations of impecunious parties represented by <i>pro

    profession, as its members not only have a collective obligation to provide
    services <i>pro bono</i> in appropriate cases, but they also, of course,
    act for clients who may be litigating against a <i>pro bono </i>party. In
    that context, the <i>amici</i> have been careful to encourage the court to
    maintain flexibility and to develop the principles on a case-by-case basis.
    I agree with that approach. As Mr. Dallal, counsel for the respondent, points
    out, the situation may become somewhat anomalous if the <i>pro bono</i> party
    has nothing at stake regarding the costs, and the real adversaries on that
    issue are the non-<i>pro bono</i> party and the <i>pro bono</i> lawyer.</p>

    concern for levelling the playing field for <i>pro bono </i>and non-<i>pro
    bono </i>litigants does not require, however, that the parties be placed
    in equal positions in every case. As the approaches adopted in some foreign
    jurisdictions illustrate, the policy objective of facilitating access to
    justice may be of sufficient importance to warrant placing the <i>pro bono </i>litigant
    in a more favourable position in some cases.  For example, although s. 18
    of the English <i>Legal Aid Act 1988</i> (U.K.), 1988, c. 34 permits courts
    to make a costs award in favour of successful litigants represented by Legal
    Aid, these litigants are normally not required to pay costs when unsuccessful.
    See John Peysner, “A Revolution By Degrees: From Costs to Financing and the
    End of the Indemnity Principle” [2001] 1 Web JCLI. Similarly, in Australia
    the rules of the Federal Magistrates and New South Wales courts permit litigants
    represented by <i>pro bono</i> counsel to seek costs awards. See <i>Federal
    Magistrates Court Rules 2001</i> (Cth.),<i> </i>rule 12.07(3) and <i>Supreme
    Court Rules 1970</i> (N.S.W.), rule 66A.9.<i> </i>Although there is no comparable
    statutory context in Ontario, these provisions support the principle that
    litigants represented by <i>pro bono</i> counsel should not be denied access

    are provisions in the rules that can be used to level the playing field when
    costs are awarded to a <i>pro bono</i> party. For example, rule 57.03(2)
    allows the court to dismiss a party’s proceeding, strike the party’s defence
    or “make such other order as is just” where that party fails to pay the costs
    of a motion as ordered. Rule 57.01(4)(b) allows the court to award only a
    percentage of assessed costs. These two rules can be used by the court to
    reduce an award of costs to a <i>pro bono</i> party who wins an interlocutory
    motion, where that party has failed to pay costs previously ordered against
    it.</p>

line-height:normal'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    correct approach, then, is for the judge in each case to be apprised of the
    status of outstanding costs orders, and then weigh the access to justice
    issues together with the particular circumstances of the interlocutory matter,
    including the conduct of the parties and the relative importance of the motion
    within the context of the litigation. The judge will have the discretion
    to make the order that fits the circumstances, including ordering costs payable
    to the <i>pro bono</i> party, reducing the quantum of those costs or limiting
    the order to disbursements, making the costs payable only at the end of the
    case, or making no order.</p>

    issue by the court. The principles that will be applied in this type of litigation
    will also develop as the cases arise.</p>

    legal profession in Ontario has a history of commitment to ensuring access
    to justice and providing <i>pro bono </i>services through its members. That
    history is reflected in today’s litigation environment where it is both appropriate
    and necessary that costs awards be available to successful <i>pro bono </i>litigants
    in ordinary private law cases both at the end of the case and on interlocutory
    motions. The principles that will guide the exercise of the court’s discretion
    in deciding when such costs will be awarded should be developed over time
    on a case-by-case basis.</p>

    matter came before the Court of Appeal primarily as an appeal from an order
    dismissing the appellants’ application without a determination on the merits.
    Because the appellant was successful in having that order set aside, the
    issue of the availability of an arbitration clause in a franchise agreement
    may now be able to be heard on the merits. In the ordinary course, costs
    would follow the event of a successful appeal and would be ordered payable
    by the respondents on the partial indemnity scale. The appellants were represented
    by <i>pro bono</i> counsel on the appeal only. Is there any reason in this
    case why the ordinary order should not be made?</p>

line-height:normal'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents point to the fact that the appellants are impecunious and that
    it was because they were unable to pay a costs order that the case was dismissed.
    However, that costs order has also been set aside. In my view, there is no
    reason why the losing party should not be ordered to pay costs of this appeal
    forthwith. If an issue with respect to future costs orders arises as the
    litigation progresses, either with <i>pro bono</i> counsel or with an in-person
    litigant, it can be addressed by the judge who hears the issue. I do not
    find it appropriate at this stage not to make the costs order payable forthwith.</p>

      bono</i> counsel has asked for $4,500 on the partial indemnity scale. The
      respondent suggests $2,000. Costs of $1,500 were fixed on a motion to extend
      the time for bringing this appeal to be payable in accordance with the
      order of the panel. In the circumstances, I would order total costs to
      the appellants in the amount of $4,500, inclusive of disbursements and
      G.S.T.</p>

    this important issue.</p>
