style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants are plaintiffs in two actions commenced under
    the <i>Class Proceedings Act, 1992</i>, S.O. 1992, c. 6 (the “Act”) against the
    respondent, The Loyalist College of Applied Arts &amp; Technology
    (“Loyalist”).  Ms. Hickey-Button sued on
    her own behalf and on behalf of all the persons who entered the nursing program
    at Loyalist in the fall of 1997.  Ms.
    Potter sued on her own behalf and on behalf of those students who entered the
    same course in the fall of 1998.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In essence, the appellants claim that when they entered the
    nursing program at Loyalist in 1997 and 1998, Loyalist offered what was
    referred to as the “Queen’s” option.  This option allowed persons who entered the nursing program at Loyalist
    to obtain a degree in nursing from Queen’s University after four years.  The appellant contend that no such option
    was available.  Their claims against
    Loyalist sound in breach of contract and alternatively in negligent
    misrepresentation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants sought certification under s. 5 of the Act<i>. </i> They asked the court to certify the actions
    as a single class action with two sub-classes, one representing students who
    entered the nursing program at Loyalist in the fall of 1997 and the other
    representing students who entered the nursing program in the fall of 1998.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge dismissed the motion to certify the actions
    in February 2003.  By order dated
    November 2, 2004, the Divisional Court unanimously dismissed the appellants’
    appeal from the order of the motion judge.  This court granted leave to appeal the order of the Divisional Court in
    May 2005.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court is reluctant to interfere with decisions made on
    motions to certify under s. 5 of the Act:  see <i>e.g. Anderson v. Wilson</i> (1999), 175 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>)
    409 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [1999] S.C.C.A. No.
    476.  Certification decisions often
    involve a careful balancing of competing interests and delicate judgment calls
    by judges who have developed an expertise in class action proceedings.  The deference owed to decisions made on
    motions under s. 5 of the Act must only grow where the decision is upheld at
    the first level of appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the present appeal, however, I am satisfied that both the
    motion judge and the Divisional Court fell into legal error on matters central
    to a proper application of s. 5 of the Act.  Those errors displace the deference usually paid to decisions on
    certification motions.  On a proper
    application of s. 5, both actions should be certified.   </p>

line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These proceedings have just passed the pleadings stage.  In addition to the pleadings, the parties
    filed affidavits on the certification motion and have cross-examined on some of
    those affidavits.  It is important to
    bear in mind that at this stage of the litigation, none of the allegations have
    been proven.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the spring of 1997, Ms. Hickey-Button submitted an
    application for admission to the three-year nursing diploma course offered by
    Loyalist.  Her application was made
    through a centralized process that receives applications for admission to
    community colleges throughout Ontario.  The application was forwarded through this centralized process to
    Loyalist.  Loyalist sent Ms.
    Hickey-Button a bundle of material describing the nursing diploma course
    offered at Loyalist.  The material made
    reference to what is known in these proceedings as the “Queen’s” option.  That option was described in at least one of
    the documents forwarded to Ms. Hickey-Button by Loyalist in this way:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In the fall of
    1997, we plan to offer a program which has been developed in collaboration with
    Queen’s University, Kingston.  The
    program will give you the unique opportunity of enrolling in a College for two
    years and at the end of that time taking a career path which leads to a degree
    or to a diploma.  The degree route will
    require two more years of study, and the diploma one year.  The plan is to offer all theory courses at
    Loyalist College and to use local health-related agencies for clinical
    practice.  Graduates of both career
    paths are eligible to write the nurse registration examination in Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In essence, the “Queen’s” option offered students who
    successfully completed two years of the three-year diploma course at Loyalist
    the option of obtaining a degree in nursing from Queen’s University by
    completing two additional years of the Queen’s nursing program.  Those two years could be completed on-site
    at Loyalist.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart from the “Queen’s” option, students who wished to obtain
    a degree in nursing from Queen’s University had two choices.  First, rather than attend Loyalist, they
    could apply directly to Queen’s University for admission to its nursing degree
    program.  If they could meet the
    entrance requirements, which were higher than those required for entrance to
    the nursing program at Loyalist, and if they could afford to go to University
    for four years, these students could obtain a degree in nursing from Queen’s upon
    a successful completion of the four year program.  Second, students could apply to the diploma course at Loyalist,
    successfully complete all three years of that course and then attend Queen’s
    University for an additional two years after which they would obtain a degree
    in nursing from Queen’s University. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the affidavit material filed in support of the
    certification application, the advantages of the “Queen’s” option over the
    other two possible ways of obtaining a nursing degree were described in this
    way:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[I]t [the
    Queen’s option] was preferable to the two traditionally available alternatives,
    being a four year university program, with higher admission requirements and
    higher costs, or three years of college study followed by two additional years
    of university, obviously involving higher costs and a longer delay before
    workforce entry.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After receiving the material from Loyalist, that included
    reference to the “Queen’s” option, Ms. Hickey-Button wrote directly to Loyalist
    confirming her application for admission to the nursing diploma course.  Her application was accepted by Loyalist and
    she entered the nursing program in the fall of 1997.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some time after Ms. Hickey-Button enrolled in the nursing
    program in the fall of 1997, she learned that the “Queen’s” option did not
    exist.  Instead, she was informed that
    negotiations were ongoing between Loyalist and Queen’s to establish that
    option.  She was assured that it would
    be in place by the fall of 1999 when she would be in a position to take
    advantage of it.  In February 1999, Ms.
    Hickey-Button learned that the negotiations had broken down and that the
    “Queen’s” option would not be available.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Hickey-Button alleges that the written material, including
    the representation as to the “Queen’s” option, provided by Loyalist to those
    who applied to the nursing program through the centralized application process
    constituted representations made by Loyalist.  Those representations were to the effect that Loyalist would consider
    offers by students to enter into a contract with Loyalist whereby Loyalist
    would provide the nursing program as represented in the material in exchange
    for payment of the tuition fee described in the material.  Ms. Hickey-Button further contended that the
    applications submitted by her and the other students after they received the
    material from Loyalist constituted offers by the students to enter into
    contracts with Loyalist on the terms described in the material sent to the
    students.  Ms. Hickey-Button next
    maintained that Loyalist’s acceptance of the applications made by her and the
    other students created a contract, the terms of which included the
    representations made in the material provided to the students by Loyalist.  One of these representations was that the
    “Queen’s” option would be available to students who completed two years of the
    diploma course.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short, Ms. Hickey-Button argued that, in exchange for the
    payment of tuition to Loyalist by the students, Loyalist promised to provide to
    the students a nursing diploma program complete with the “Queen’s” option.  When Loyalist failed to provide that option,
    it breached its contract with Ms. Hickey-Button and her classmates.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Alternatively, Ms. Hickey-Button alleged that the material
    sent to her included a representation by Loyalist that the “Queen’s” option
    would be available to students who enrolled in the Loyalist nursing program in
    the fall of 1997.  She contended that
    Loyalist owed her and the other students a duty of care with respect to that
    representation.  She further alleged
    that the representation was false, was negligently made, and that she and other
    students relied on it to their detriment when enrolling in the nursing program
    at Loyalist.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Hickey-Button contended that her damages included extra
    costs incurred by virtue of the need to spend an additional year in the
    educational system, extra costs involved in having to attend a university
    rather than remain at Loyalist for the entire educational experience, and loss
    of income resulting from a one year delay in entry into the nursing
    workforce.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The action commenced by Ms. Potter on behalf of herself and
    her classmates who applied for admission to the nursing program at Loyalist
    beginning in the fall of 1998 is virtually identical to Ms. Hickey-Button’s
    claim with the exception that Ms. Potter contends that the material concerning
    the “Queen’s” option was provided to her and her classmates in the spring of
    1998.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In its defence, Loyalist denied that it provided any false,
    misleading, or inaccurate information concerning the “Queen’s” option in the
    material supplied to persons who had applied for admission to its nursing
    program in 1997 or 1998.  Loyalist
    contended that the material made it clear that the “Queen’s” option was in the
    developmental stage only.  According to
    Loyalist, it had a reasonable expectation that the option would be developed
    until January 1999 when Queen’s University unilaterally withdrew from the
    negotiations to finalize the terms of the option.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Loyalist alleged that it had made clear to all prospective
    Loyalist students that, in any event, the “Queen’s” option would be available
    only to students who had completed certain university level courses and had
    achieved a high minimum grade point average while at Loyalist.  Loyalist maintained that, even if the
    “Queen’s” option had been successfully negotiated between Loyalist and Queen’s,
    the option would have been available only to a select few students who could
    meet the stringent admission requirements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Loyalist contended that the material provided by it to
    prospective students, including information about the “Queen’s” option, could
    not in law constitute a contract between Loyalist and its students.  Furthermore, Loyalist maintained that even
    if the material containing the “Queen’s” option could provide the basis for a
    contractual relationship between Loyalist and its students, the nature and
    terms of the contract depended on the entirety of the representations made to
    individual students by Loyalist.  These
    representations included not only representations in the written material
    provided to students, especially the course calendar, but also oral
    representations made to students in various informational sessions and attended
    by some, but not all, of the students who entered the nursing program in 1997 and
    1998.  Loyalist maintained that the
    terms of the contract between Loyalist and each of the students could vary from
    student to student.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Loyalist acknowledged that the contents of the material it
    provided to prospective students could constitute representations for the
    purposes of a negligent misrepresentation claim, but asserted that the
    viability of a negligent misrepresentation claim could be determined only on a
    student-by-student basis.  Individual
    inquiries were necessary to determine the content of the representations made
    to each student, and the reliance, if any, placed on those representations by
    each student.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Loyalist also took the position that neither the appellants
    nor any members of the prospective class had suffered any damage in that they had
    not shown that they would have been eligible for entry into Queen’s under the
    terms of the “Queen’s” option had it come to fruition.  Finally, Loyalist contended that neither of
    the appellants nor any other members of the proposed class had taken advantage
    of an alternative program available to them through Athabasca University.  That program would have placed the students
    in the same position as the “Queen’s” option.</p>

    “verbal” contract would vary from student to student depending on the
    information provided to each student by Loyalist prior to the student enrolling
    in the nursing diploma course.  The
    motion judge held that the merits of the negligent misrepresentation claim
    could also be determined only a student-by-student basis.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    motion judge mischaracterized the appellants’ contract claim.  The appellants maintained that the terms of
    the contract were to be found in the written material supplied to all students
    in response to their applications.  The
    appellants did not rely on any oral or “verbal” contract.  This mischaracterization of the contract
    claim may well have influenced the motion judge’s finding that a class action
    proceeding was not appropriate.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    motion judge did not relate his conclusion that the actions should not be
    certified to the specific subsections of s. 5.  His findings, however, clearly speak to a lack of common issues (s.
    5(1)(c)) and implicitly support the conclusion that a class proceeding would
    not be the preferable procedure (s. 5(1)(d)).  The Divisional Court came to the same conclusion on both issues, and I
    will address the merits of that conclusion when considering the Divisional Court’s
    decision.  </span></p>

    motion judge did specifically consider s. 5(1)(b).  He concluded that there was no identifiable class that would be
    represented by the appellants.  In
    coming to that conclusion, he said:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>One must be able
    to determine with ease who is and who is not a member of the class.  If the merits in the individual
    circumstances of a person’s claim must be looked at in order to determine
    whether that person is within the class, then the class is not identifiable.  <u>In this case, in order to find out if a
    student falls within the class, each student would have to be examined under
    oath because only those students who intended to participate in the Queen’s
    option who would not have attended Loyalist had the Queen’s option not been
    offered and who would have qualified to do so, would potentially have a cause
    of action.</u>  The class is not to

    evident from this passage, the motion judge was satisfied that each student would
    have a cause of action only if he or she could demonstrate, first an intention
    to participate in the “Queen’s” option upon entering Loyalist, second, that he
    or she would not have attended Loyalist “but for” the “Queen’s” option, and,
    third, that the student would have qualified for that option after two years at
    Loyalist.</span></p>

    of the three prerequisites identified by the motion judge are as a matter of
    law, prerequisites to a successful claim by the students in contract or
    negligence.  If the appellants could
    demonstrate that a contract existed between Loyalist and the students entering
    the nursing program in 1997 and 1998, and that the contract included the
    availability of the “Queen’s” option, the students all had a claim for breach
    of contract if that option was not available as promised.  The three factors identified by the motion
    judge could at the most have some impact on the damages available to individual
    students for the breach of the contract.  The appellants have never contended that the quantification of damages
    raises a common issue in these proceedings.</span></p>

    three factors identified by the motion judge are also not prerequisites to the
    appellants’ success on the negligent misrepresentation claim.  A misrepresentation can be material without
    being a “but for” cause of a student’s decision to attend Loyalist.  There can also be sufficient reliance on a
    representation to found a negligent misrepresentation claim even if a student
    had not made a firm decision to take advantage of the “Queen’s” option when
    that student enrolled at Loyalist.  Finally, an inability to qualify for the “Queen’s” option two years
    after entry to Loyalist would be relevant to the assessment of an individual
    student’s damages, but would not necessarily foreclose any award of damages
    based on negligent misrepresentation.</span></p>

    dismissing the appeals from the refusal of the motion judge to certify the
    action as a class action, the Divisional Court noted that the motion judge had
    mischaracterized the plaintiffs’ allegations when he said they alleged a
    “verbal” contract.  The Divisional Court
    also doubted whether the motion judge had correctly held that the appellants
    had not properly identified a class of persons for the purposes of s.

    Divisional Court went on to dismiss the appeal.  The court agreed with the motion judge that the allegations made
    in the claims could only be determined on a student-by-student basis.  The court observed that issues such as
    reliance could only be determined by examining the circumstances “pertinent to
    the contractual relationship between each student and the College”.  The Divisional Court also noted that the
    measure of damages would vary substantially from student to student.  This view of the allegations led the
    Divisional Court to hold:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>We prefer
    instead to rest our disposition on our conclusion that a class proceeding would
    not be the preferable procedure for the resolution of the common issues as
    required by section 5(1)(d) of the <i>Class Proceedings Act</i>.  We come to this <u>conclusion because we
    cannot identify any common issue raised in these actions and, as well, on our
    view that it would be preferable for each claim to be determined in an ordinary
    action in which each student wishing to assert a claim would be a named
    plaintiff in either one action or in separate actions to be tried together.</u>  We see no advantage in allowing this action
    to proceed as a class action in order to effect a fair, just, expedient and

    proceeding was the “preferable procedure” would normally be accorded
    substantial deference.  In this case,
    however, that conclusion was premised on the Divisional Court’s finding that
    there were no identifiable common issues.  The court erred in making that finding.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In their pleadings and affidavits filed on the motion, the
    appellants claim that all of the students who entered in the nursing program at
    Loyalist in 1997 and 1998 did so under the terms of a contract that included
    the “Queen’s” option.  With respect to
    the contract allegation, at least the following common issues are raised:</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>¨<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Was the relationship between Loyalist and those
    students who entered the nursing program in 1997 and 1998 a contractual
    relationship?</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>¨<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If there was a contractual relationship, did the
    contract include the “Queen’s” option and, if so, what were the terms of that
    option?</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>¨<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If there was a contractual relationship, and if the

    breach that contract?</p>

'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>¨<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If there was a contract and if there was a breach, do
    any of the general defences advanced by Loyalist (<i>e.g.</i> the availability
    of the “Athabasca University” alternative) provide a complete defence to the
    claims?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These common issues are central to the appellants’
    contract-based claim.  If they are
    unsuccessful in any of the first three issues, the contract claim will
    fail.  If, however, the appellants are
    successful on the first three issues, it would seem that the assessment of
    damages for breach of contract is all that would be left for individual
    assessments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In holding that there were no common issues raised, the
    Divisional court observed that reliance on the existence of the “Queen’s”
    option would have to be established on a student-by-student basis.  In my view, reliance is not a prerequisite
    to recovery in the breach of contract claim, although it is a precondition to
    recovery in the negligent misrepresentation claim and may have to be determined
    on a student-by-student basis.  It is,
    however, no answer to a contention that common issues exist to demonstrate that
    there are some issues that are not common to all parties of the class.  In most actions where certification is
    sought, there will be both common and individual issues:  <i>Cloud</i>, <i>supra</i>, at paras.

  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>¨<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Did Loyalist owe a duty of care when making

    that the terms of a contractual relationship between a student and his or her
    college or university must be found only in the document described as the

    proceeding is the preferable procedure for the resolution of the common
    issues.  Bearing in mind the potential
    advantages of a class action in terms of judicial economy, access to justice
    and behavioural modification, the court must determine whether the class action
    provides a fair, efficient and manageable method of advancing the claims made
    that is superior to other reasonably available means of resolving those claims.  In the circumstances of this case,
    individual actions by the various students provide the only alternative to a
    class proceedings.  </span></p>

    examination of the common issues and, in particular, the significance of those
    issues to the overall action will play a key role in deciding whether a class
    proceeding is a preferable procedure.  The more numerous the common issues in the litigation, and the more
    central those issues are to the outcome of the litigation, the stronger will be
    the argument for a class proceeding:  <i>Inco</i>, <i>supra</i>, paras. 69-74.  I have
    already outlined the numerous common issues raised in these proceedings.  I have also indicated that in my view those
    common issues are central to the outcome of this litigation.  If the appellants cannot succeed on those
    common issues, the action will fail.  It
    is only if the appellants are successful on those issues that various
    individual issues specific to each student, such as damage-related issues, will
    have to be determined.  </span></p>

    number of common issues raised by the appellants and their significance to the
    litigation makes this a case where it can be said that a class proceeding is a
    “preferable” procedure.  The interests
    of judicial economy would be well served by addressing the common issues in a
    single class proceeding rather than in a number of individual actions.  </span></p>

    to justice concerns also favour a class proceeding.  On the uncontradicted evidence, some of the students who would be
    members of the two sub-classes proposed by the appellants cannot afford to
    pursue their claims on an individual basis.  Some, if not many, of the individual students will be entitled, if
    successful, to relatively modest damages.  Considering the costs of litigation, it is understandable that many
    individual students could not afford that cost or could not justify expending
    the necessary funds given the relatively modest potential gain.  </span></p>

    modification of the wrongdoers whose conduct may cause widespread harm, even
    though the quantum of harm done to any particular individual may be modest, is
    a further benefit flowing from a class proceeding:  <i>Inco</i>, <i>supra</i>, at paras. 87-88.  The appellants’ claims can be generically
    described as consumer protection claims.  Class action proceedings can call to account those who in the course of selling
    their product to the public cause widespread, but individually modest, economic
    harm to consumers.  Accountability is an
    important first step toward behaviour modification:  <i>Inco</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 87.  There is also merit in the contention that behaviour modification
    has added value when directed at public institutions like Loyalist. </span></p>

    what I regard as a strong case for certification, Loyalist points to many
    individual issues that could possibly arise in the course of these
    proceedings.  On the material that is
    presently before the court, the possibility of many of these issues actually
    arising is somewhat remote.  In any
    event, the possibility that individual issues may arise in the course of the
    class proceeding is no reason to deny certification if it is otherwise the
    preferable mode of proceeding.  The
    certification process is sufficiently flexible to react to changes in the
    litigation landscape that occur in the course of the class proceeding. </span></p>

    the motion judge nor the Divisional Court dealt with this requirement.  Counsel did not address any oral argument to

    no reason to doubt that the appellants will fairly and adequately represent the
    interests of the two sub-classes.  There
    is also no suggestion that either appellant has any conflict of interest with
    other class members.  I think questions
    relating to any deficiencies in the litigation plan submitted by the appellants
    are best addressed by permitting Loyalist to raise such complaints by a motion
    under s. 5 of the Act to settle the details of the certification order.  </span></p>

    would allow the appeal, set aside the orders of the Divisional Court and the
    motion judge, and substitute an order granting the motion for certification on
    terms that are consistent with these reasons.  The case should be remitted to the supervision of the Regional Senior
    Justice or such judge as he or she directs to manage the action.  That judge can determine the specifics of
    the certification order including the description of the common issues.</span></p>

    should receive $27,000 on the motion, $15,000 for the appeal in the Divisional
