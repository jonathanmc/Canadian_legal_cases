      the oral hearing, counsel advanced two arguments to this court on behalf
      of Prudenza and Dalglish.  One argument alleged that the extradition judge
      erred in refusing to stay the extradition proceedings as an abuse of process.  The
      second argument alleged that the Minister of Justice violated Prudenza’s
      and Dalglish’s constitutional rights under s. 6(1) of the <i>Canadian Charter
      of Rights and Freedoms</i> (the
    “<i>Charter</i>”) when he ordered them surrendered to the United States.  The
    court did not call on the Crown to respond to either submission.  Following
    oral arguments, the appeals and applications for judicial review of Prudenza
    and Dalglish were dismissed with reasons to follow.  </span></p>

      Anderson raised an argument that did not apply to Prudenza and Dalglish.  He
      submitted that the extradition judge erred in law when she refused to allow
      his counsel to call a person named Mark Lennox as a witness at the extradition
      hearing.  Mr. Lennox is an alleged co-conspirator and a former co-accused
      of Mr. Anderson and the other applicants/appellants.  He was intimately
      involved in the events giving rise to the charges underlying the extradition
      request.  A statement given by Mr. Lennox to American investigators as
      well as his Grand Jury testimony in the United States are heavily relied
      on by the authorities in support of the extradition request.  Without Mr.
      Lennox’s statement and testimony, it is arguable that there was not enough
      evidence to justify Mr. Anderson’s committal for extradition.  </span></p>

      States of America v. Ferras</i> (2006), 209 C.C.C. (3d) 353 (S.C.C.).  The
      extradition judge did not have the benefit of the reasons in <i>Ferras</i> when

      between September 2001 and the end of December 2002.  The appellants hired
      telemarketers to contact people in the United States who had poor credit
      records.  These individuals were told that the company represented by the
      telemarketers could obtain pre-approved MasterCard and Visa credit cards
      for them in exchange for an advance fee.  The amount of the advance fee
      varied, but was usually around $200.</span></p>

      is alleged that the operation never provided pre-approved credit cards
      to any of the individuals who paid the advance fee.  According to Mr. Lennox,
      the operation was “a complete and total scam”.  At its peak, there were
      250 telemarketers making calls from six to eight different locations in
      Toronto.  The calls were made exclusively to residents of the United States.  Victims
      of the scheme were defrauded of more than $7,000,000.  </span></p>

      joint investigation by Canadian and American authorities into the telemarketing
      operation began in the fall of 2002.  In October 2002, the appellants were
      arrested by Canadian authorities and charged with a number of fraud counts
      and with making false representations contrary to the <i>Competition Act</i>,
      R.S.C. 1985, c. C-34.  The charges were prosecuted by counsel on behalf
      of the Attorney General of Canada.  The appellants were released on bail.</span></p>

      July 15, 2003, the Minister of Justice for Canada received an extradition
      request from the United States.  The request related to the same charges
      that were being prosecuted in Canada.  A “<i>Cotroni</i> assessment” was
      completed for the Minister of Justice in November 2003.  On December 3,
      2003, the Minister of Justice issued an authority to proceed with the extradition
      request.  The appellants were arrested on an extradition warrant and released
      on bail.  The Canadian charges were stayed about two weeks later. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      the course of the extradition proceedings, the appellants brought a disclosure
      application in the Superior Court seeking the production of documentation
      in the possession of Canadian and American authorities that the appellants
      argued could support their argument that the extradition proceedings amounted
      to an abuse of process.  The appellants contended that the Canadian authorities
      never intended to proceed with the Canadian criminal charges, but had used
      them as a means of keeping the appellants on bail until the extradition
      request was made and approved.  The disclosure motion was denied in June
      2004.  An appeal to this court was quashed on the basis that the court
      had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal.  </span></p>

      motion on the same grounds as those advanced on the disclosure motion.  The
      appellants also sought an order requiring the Crown to disclose the material
      that the appellants had sought in the earlier motion.  The extradition
      judge allowed the appellants to call evidence in support of their disclosure
      request and their claim that the extradition proceedings amounted to an

      for the appellants renewed their abuse of process claim in this court.  In
      oral argument, counsel narrowed their positions somewhat from those advanced
      in their facta.  They argued that the abuse of process lay in the misuse
      of the Canadian criminal proceedings.  Counsel submitted that from at least
      July 2003, when the American authorities requested extradition, the Crown
      had no intention to proceed with the criminal proceedings in Canada.  Counsel
      described these proceedings as a “sham” continued only to maintain a bail
      order on the appellants pending a final decision on the extradition request.  Counsel
      submit that this misuse of the Canadian criminal process is sufficiently
      offensive to warrant a stay of the extradition proceedings. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Counsel
      for the appellants point to two facts to support their claim that the Canadian
      authorities had no intention of proceeding with the Canadian prosecution
      after July 2003.  First, counsel refer to the Canadian prosecutor’s “refusal” to
      negotiate a guilty plea with Prudenza.  Second, counsel submit that the
      record filed on the abuse of process motion reveals that disclosure on
      the Canadian charges
    “dried up” in late July 2003, at almost the exact same time that the extradition
    request was made.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
      indicated above, on the abuse of process motion the appellants sought production
      of materials in the possession of the Canadian and American authorities
      which the appellants alleged could assist them in establishing an abuse
      of process.  After the production motion failed, the appellants argued
      the merits of the abuse of process motion based on the motion record and
      Mr. Goldman’s evidence.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      burden on the appellants on the production motion is significantly lower
      than the burden placed on the appellants to justify a stay of proceedings.  I
      will address the abuse of process claim in the context of the motion for
      production.  As I am satisfied that the production request was properly
      rejected, it follows that there is no merit to the claim that the proceedings
      should have been stayed as an abuse of process.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>An
      extradition judge has the power to stay extradition proceedings as an abuse
      of the court’s process: see <i>United States of America v. Cobb</i> (2001),
      152 C.C.C. (3d) 270 at paras. 36-39 (S.C.C.).  The power to stay proceedings
      as an abuse of process can arise where fairness of the hearing itself has
      been compromised, or where the conduct of the prosecutorial authorities
      has brought the administration of justice into sufficient disrepute to
      require that the proceedings be stayed to maintain the integrity of the
      judicial process: <i>R. v. Larosa</i> (2002), 166 C.C.C. (3d) 449 at paras.
      48-52 (Ont. C.A.).  The appellants rely on their claim of prosecutorial
      misconduct to establish the second form of an abuse of process.  The fairness
      of the extradition hearing is not an issue.</span></p>

      225 at paras. 99-100 (S.C.C.).  Extradition proceedings are not, however,
      trials or even preliminary inquiries into charges that may be tried in
      Canada.  Relevance to the ultimate charges is no basis for ordering production
      in an extradition hearing.  Requests for production must be clearly linked
      to issues properly raised in the extradition context.  Otherwise, the extradition
      process will become, at best, unwieldy and, at worst, unworkable.</span></p>

      of process motion with a waiver of the client/solicitor privilege from
      Prudenza limited to issues relating to the possible negotiation of a guilty
      plea.  Mr. Goldman did not have his trial file with him when he testified

      Goldman testified that he spoke informally on various occasions with counsel
      from the office of the Attorney General of Canada who had carriage of the
      criminal prosecution about the possibility of a negotiated guilty plea
      by Prudenza to the Canadian charges.  Mr. Goldman regarded the case against
      Prudenza as overwhelming.  Mr. Goldman testified that the first time he
      spoke with the Crown, Crown counsel suggested a jail term that Mr. Goldman
      thought was excessive.  On subsequent occasions when Mr. Goldman raised
      the possibility of a guilty plea with a negotiated sentence, Crown counsel
      indicated that he was not prepared to negotiate a guilty plea with Prudenza
      unless all of the accused were prepared to plead guilty.  It would appear
      that Crown counsel took this position well before July 2003.  As I read
      Mr. Goldman’s evidence, he never discussed the possibility of pleas by
      all the accused with the other counsel.  There is also no evidence that
      Prudenza raised it with any of the other accused.  </span></p>

      Goldman testified that Prudenza was very aware of the possibility of extradition
      to the United States from the moment the criminal charges were laid in
      Canada.  Prudenza had previously been convicted of telemarketing fraud
      in the United States and knew that he faced far more serious penalties
      if extradited to the United States and prosecuted for fraud in that country.  According
      to Mr. Goldman,  Prudenza was anxious to avoid extradition, but also wanted
      to get the best deal he could from the Canadian authorities.  </span></p>

      never instructed Mr. Goldman to enter a guilty plea on his behalf.  </span></p>

      the disclosure problems that had developed in the Canadian prosecution
      and that these problems could enure to his benefit.  Mr. Goldman indicated
      that Prudenza was of two minds insofar as delays in the Canadian proceedings
      were concerned.  He worried that the delay in disclosure could open the
      door for extradition to the United States, but he also thought that the
      delay could result in him getting a better deal on a guilty plea in the
      Canadian criminal proceedings.  </span></p>

      Goldman’s evidence gives no air of reality to the allegation that the Crown
      refused to negotiate a plea with Prudenza as part of a strategy to keep
      the Canadian charges alive until the extradition request was forthcoming.  There
      is nothing wrong with a Crown taking the position that it would negotiate
      guilty pleas only if all persons charged were prepared to plead guilty.  Negotiated
      settlements are often justified at least in part because they save time
      and judicial resources.  Those savings are significant in a case like this
      only if all accused plead guilty.  </span></p>

      took this position very early in the Canadian criminal proceedings.  </span></p>

      Goldman’s evidence also confirms that Prudenza was aware of the risk of
      extradition and the possibility of avoiding that risk by pleading guilty
      to the fraud charges in Canada.  The Crown did nothing to prevent Prudenza
      from pleading guilty had he chosen to do so.  Prudenza did not testify
      on the motion, and I certainly will not assume that he did not understand
      that he could plead guilty in the criminal proceedings without the Crown’s
      permission.  Mr. Goldman’s evidence describing Prudenza’s state of mind
      makes sense only if Prudenza was aware of the option of pleading guilty
      to the Canadian charges when and if he desired to do so.  </span></p>

      the plea in Canada could assist him in the Canadian proceedings if he eventually

      of extradition to the United States.  As Crown counsel suggested to Mr.

      take his chances.”  Mr. Goldman agreed with this suggestion.  </span></p>

      in December 2002 through July 2003.  Crown counsel provided some twenty
      volumes of disclosure in addition to a copy of a computer hard disk drive
      containing the contents of the various computer disks seized from the appellants
      during searches.  In July 2003, and again in September 2003, counsel for
      two of the accused in the Canadian criminal proceedings wrote to Crown
      counsel demanding further and far reaching disclosure.  In a letter dated
      December 3, 2003, Crown counsel with carriage of the Canadian criminal
      prosecution advised counsel for the accused that he was aware of the outstanding
      disclosure requests and that it was taking some time to formulate his response.  On
      the same day, the Minister of Justice authorized the extradition proceedings. </span></p>

      record lends no air of reality to the contention that the Crown stopped
      providing disclosure in July because it had decided in July that it would
      not proceed with the Canadian prosecution.  The Crown had obviously spent
      a great deal of time and money providing disclosure up to July 2003.  That
      disclosure was sufficient to demonstrate an overwhelming case against,
      at least, Prudenza involving a fraud of around $6,000,000.  Despite the
      extensive disclosure, Crown counsel was met with wide ranging requests
      for further disclosure.  It does not seem unreasonable to me that these
      requests would not necessarily attract the highest priority by the Crown,
      and would take some time to consider and to respond on behalf of the Crown.  </span></p>

      did not call any evidence to contradict what Crown counsel said.  It also
      makes no sense that Crown counsel would deliberately mislead defence counsel
      on the disclosure issue as of December 3, 2003.  On that date, the authority
      to extradite was given and the extradition proceedings were underway.  Clearly,
      the Canadian charges were not going to proceed.  There was no point in
      misleading anybody about the Canadian criminal proceedings on December
      3, 2003.</span></p>

      would add a further observation.  The appellants’
    submissions seem to assume that it is improper for a Canadian prosecutor
    to maintain a Canadian criminal prosecution while a request for extradition
    is being considered by the Minister of Justice.  I see nothing wrong with
    maintaining the Canadian criminal charges, assuming that they were brought <i>bona
    fide</i>, until the Minister decides whether to authorize extradition proceedings.  As
    indicated in <i>Larosa</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 60, it is only after the
    Minister of Justice has authorized extradition proceedings that the Canadian
    charges on the same offences cannot remain outstanding.  </span></p>

      also would not fault the Crown prosecuting the Canadian charges if he or
      she delayed expending substantial time and resources on the Canadian prosecution
      until the Minister of Justice had decided whether to authorize proceeding
      with the extradition.  This approach seems to be a common sense use of
      limited resources.  It goes without saying that once criminal charges are
      before the court, it is ultimately the court and not the Crown that will
      determine the pace at which the charges proceed.  However, if the Canadian
      charges ultimately do proceed and delay becomes an issue, the prosecution
      may be held accountable under the analysis required by s. 11(b) of the <i>Charter</i> for
      delays caused by its response to disclosure requests.  </span></p>
