style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant pled guilty to three counts of breach of recognizance and was convicted,
    following a trial, of sexual assault and sexual touching, the first of which
    was stayed following <i>Kienapple</i>. The appellant was sentenced to three
    months each consecutive on the three breaches and to three years over and
    above time served of three months and four days for a total sentence of four
    years and four days, giving one for one credit only for pre-trial custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    facts of the offences for which the appellant was convicted involved touching
    a young boy over his clothes on the thigh. However, at the time, the appellant
    had been recently convicted of sexual interference with his daughter for
    which he received a five-month sentence and he was subject to an order prohibiting
    him from being alone with children. As well, the trial judge was informed
    of the existence of a report of a Dr. Dion which was not made an exhibit,
    but which apparently indicated that the appellant had been treated for paedophilia
    between 1994 and 1996, that he could not verbalize gaining from the treatment
    and there was a likelihood he would sexually abuse children in the future.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree that although the facts of the offence were at the low end of gravity
    for this type of offence, it was appropriate for the trial judge to take
    all of the appellant’s circumstances into account and to impose a significant
    sentence for the protection of the public. However, in our view, given the
    nature of the particular offence together with the fact that the doctor’s
    report was not filed as an exhibit and the full scope of his opinion is not
    available for review by this court, the total sentence imposed is excessive. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    therefore grant leave to appeal sentence and reduce the sentence on the sexual
    touching to two years. All other terms of the sentence are to remain the
    same.</p>
