style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals from his convictions for robbery with a firearm and aggravated
    assault. He also seeks leave to appeal the global sentence imposed of three
    years of imprisonment in addition to credit for five years of pre-sentence

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    charges arose out of the shooting of 17-year-old J.D. on the evening of September
    28, 2002. As he was approaching his car after leaving a house party, J.D.
    was accosted by a group of men who wanted to rob him. One of the men pulled
    a gun and pointed it at J.D. J.D. fought back and struggled with the gunman
    for control of the gun. During the struggle, the other men attacked J.D.
    causing him to stumble. The gun was fired several times. Following the initial
    set of shots, the rest of the group fled leaving J.D. and the gunman struggling
    for the gun. Two more shots were fired, one of which injured J.D.’s finger.
    J.D. pulled away and ran to his car. The gunman followed him, shot him in
    the back paralyzing him instantly and robbed him of a set of gold and diamond
    studded teeth.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her reasons, the trial judge said she was not satisfied beyond a reasonable
    doubt that the appellant was the shooter, but she was satisfied that he was
    a member of the group who attacked J.D. She found that the purpose of the
    group was to rob J.D. She concluded that as soon as the gun was passed from
    one member of the group to the shooter, the member of the group who passed
    the gun said, “just pop him”, and the gun was pointed at J.D., each member
    of the group had to know that a firearm was being used during the course
    of the robbery. She noted that although J.D. did not recall whether other
    members of the group had their hands on the gun, he did testify that the
    gun was fired several times while other members of the group were close at
    hand.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raises three issues on his appeal against conviction. First, the
    appellant claims that the trial judge erred in her assessment of the significance
    of the evidence concerning a bullet wound to the appellant’s finger and that
    her conclusion that the appellant was involved in the robbery on the basis
    of the bullet wound was not available on the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree. Read fairly, the trial judge’s reasons indicate that she concluded
    the appellant was involved in the robbery based on an accumulation of evidence
    that included the following:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>a
    photo line-up identification of the appellant as the shooter by J.D.;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>(b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>a
    second photo line-up identification of the appellant as the shooter;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>(c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>circumstantial
    evidence that satisfied the trial judge that Mr. Taylor was at the scene
    when the offences occurred; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>(d)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>evidence
    of the bullet wound to the appellant’s finger.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the trial judge acknowledged that there were frailties in the identification
    evidence that caused her to have a reasonable doubt about whether Mr. Taylor
    was the man who shot J.D., she was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
    he was a member of the group that robbed and attacked J.D. The trial judge
    said: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view these pieces of evidence taken cumulatively
    do establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Taylor was a member of the
    group that attacked and robbed [J.D.]. To find otherwise would be to conclude
    that Mr. Taylor was the unlucky victim of a completely improbable series
    of coincidences. He was there, he was shot in a manner consistent with being
    involved in a struggle for a gun and he was identified by two people as the
    main perpetrator.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, contrary to the appellant’s submissions, the trial judge did not
    place undue weight on the bullet wound evidence nor rely on it for impermissible
    inferences. Rather, she simply relied on that evidence as one piece of an
    accumulation of evidence that she concluded established the appellant’s guilt
    beyond a reasonable doubt. In our view, this conclusion was available on
    the accumulation of evidence the trial judge identified and the appellant
    has not demonstrated any palpable and overriding error in her findings. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellant claims that, in convicting him, the trial judge erred in law
    by relying on an out-of-court statement made by the appellant’s co-accused
    as evidence against the appellant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree that near the end of her reasons, the trial judge improperly included
    the evidence of this statement in her recitation of the evidence that placed
    the appellant in the vicinity of the robbery. However, we accept the Crown’s
    submission that the other evidence placing the appellant in the vicinity
    of the robbery was compelling and that there is no reasonable possibility
    that the verdict would have been different had this error not been made.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in finding that the appellant
    must have known that a firearm, as opposed to an imitation firearm, was being
    used in the robbery. We disagree. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the appellant was acting in concert with a group that
    set out to rob the victim; that during the course of the robbery, the weapon
    was passed from one member of the group to another; and that prior to any
    shots being fired one member of the group said: “just pop him”. On the basis
    of this evidence and the evidence that the group members were in close proximity
    to the weapon during the course of the struggle, we are satisfied that the
    trial judge’s finding was available on the evidence. Moreover, in light of
    these circumstances, in our view, the trial judge made no error in failing
    to advert to the victim’s evidence that he thought that the weapon looked
    like a B.B. gun.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the issue of sentence, the appellant submits that taking into account his
    limited role in the shooting, his youth, and the fact that he had never previously
    served a lengthy term of incarceration, the sentence is unfit. Further, he
    asserts that the trial judge erred by failing to allude to the sentencing
    principle that a first penitentiary sentence for a youthful offender should
    be the minimum sentence possible to satisfy the requirements of denunciation
    and deterrence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree. In our view, the following factors justify the sentence that was
    imposed:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> the
    offence involved a planned and vicious attack on an entirely innocent victim
    in order to rob him;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> a
    loaded gun was used during the attack;  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> during
    the struggle for control of the gun, five to seven shots were fired in the
    middle of a suburban neighbourhood with dozens of people standing around.
    This conduct demonstrates a callous disregard for the lives and safety of
    not only the victim but innocent bystanders and people living in the neighbourhood;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  the

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  when
    the victim reacted to the gun that was pointed at his chest the group, which
    had surrounded him, punched and kicked him to ensure that the gunman maintained
    control of the gun;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> after
    the victim managed to escape and was running to his car, he was shot in the
    back, almost killing him, and rendering him paralyzed from the waist down;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> the

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  the
    appellant had a significant prior youth record, including a robbery during

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  the
    appellant was on probation for that robbery at the time he committed the
    instant offences and his probation order included a curfew from 11:00 p.m.
    to 6:00 a.m. indicating that he should not have been at the house party at
    the time of these offences;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> the
    offence of aggravated assault carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment
    while robbery with a firearm carries a minimum sentence of four years imprisonment
    and a maximum sentence of life imprisonment; and the need to deter and denounce
    the illegal use of firearms.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on the foregoing reasons, the conviction appeal is dismissed. While leave
    to appeal sentence is granted, the sentence appeal is also dismissed.</p>
