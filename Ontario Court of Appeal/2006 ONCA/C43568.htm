style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    January 24, 1997, William Johannes, murdered his sister, Roslyn Knipe.  Johannes
    had been an involuntary patient pursuant to the <i>Mental Health Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. M.7 at Humber Memorial Hospital in Toronto.  He was released
    from Humber Memorial Hospital (prior to the murder) on December 5, 1996.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Knipe’s husband, Kalid Ahmed, commenced an action on his own behalf and on
    behalf of his two daughters (the “respondents”) against Dr. Rodica Stefaniu
    (the “appellant”) for medical malpractice.  The appellant, a psychiatrist,
    was responsible for the care of Johannes at Humber Memorial Hospital and
    made the decision to change his status from an involuntary patient to a voluntary
    patient on December 5, 1996.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    a jury trial presided over by Justice Harvey Spiegel of the Superior Court
    of Justice in Toronto, the appellant was found to be negligent in that she
    failed to meet the standard of care of a psychiatrist practising in a general
    in-patient psychiatric unit in a community hospital, when she made the decision
    to change Johannes’ status under the <i>Mental Health Act</i> to that of
    a voluntary patient.  The respondents were awarded damages in the amount
    of $160,000 and additional damages of some $12,000 which had been agreed
    upon between the parties before trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals the finding of negligence made against her.  For the reasons
    which follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    October 1995, Johannes was admitted to the Scarborough General Hospital as
    an involuntary patient.  He was said to have threatened his landlord and
    engaged in aggressive behaviour.  He was prescribed medication to treat a
    psychotic disorder.  After his release from Scarborough General Hospital,
    he was readmitted as a voluntary patient with a diagnosis of acute psychosis.  After
    his second hospital stay, he lived with his sister and her two daughters
    where he functioned reasonably well.  He returned to work.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the summer of 1996, the condition of Johannes deteriorated.  He exhibited
    bizarre, aggressive and paranoid behaviour.  On September 25, 1996, his sister
    contacted Johannes’ family doctor and expressed concern about her brother.  She
    told the family doctor that Johannes had threatened to hurt her if she did
    not prove that she was “on his side” within two weeks.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    following day, September 26, Johannes was forcibly taken by the police to
    the emergency department of the Humber Memorial Hospital.  On September 27,
    1996, the appellant assessed Johannes and concluded that he was lacking insight,
    with severe paranoia, and that he had a potential for violence.  On September
    28, 1996, Johannes was admitted to the Humber Memorial Hospital as an involuntary
    patient pursuant to a Form 3 under the <i>Mental Health Act</i>.  The attending
    physician on September 28, 1996, found that Johannes was likely to cause
    serious bodily harm to another person.  He was also declared not mentally
    fit to consent to treatment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Johannes
    appealed his involuntary hospital admission to the Consent and Capacity Review
    Board.  A hearing was held on October 8, 1996.  In its decision, the Board
    concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he Board is of the opinion that at this time,
    without treatment, there is a likelihood that the patient if he left hospital
    would continue to deteriorate to the point where there is a likelihood that
    he will cause serious bodily harm to another person.  He would simply lose
    control due to anger and frustration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    mid-October, the appellant recorded the following in a progress note concerning
    Johannes: “further deterioration of his mental state with potential for self
    harm and/or harassing others”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    October 24, 1996, Johannes struck another patient.  He had to be placed in
    two-point restraints due to his level of agitation.  On October 31, 1996,
    Johannes threatened the Department Chief and a staff psychiatrist.  Following
    the latter episode, Johannes was involved in a fight with two staff porters.  Two
    security guards were required to subdue him and place him in four-point restraints.  While
    in Humber Memorial Hospital, physical restraints were used on Johannes on
    25 different occasions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    mid-November, the hospital security records disclose that Johannes attempted
    to assault two patients.  On December 2, 1996, the appellant did an assessment
    of Johannes.  Her progress note refers to Johannes as remaining delusional
    and paranoid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    nurses’ notes of December 3, 1996, describe Johannes as very angry, loud
    and intrusive, with threatening body language and a rigid posture.  He is
    further described as
    “extremely hostile”.  On the following day, December 4, 1996, Johannes threatened
    a nurse.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to the above, there was also evidence before the court that over
    the course of his hospital stay, Johannes became less threatening in his
    manner, facial expression and interactions with the hospital staff.  Although
    not a model patient, there was observed a general trend of improvement in
    his behaviour.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the early evening of December 4, 1996, the appellant carried out an assessment
    of Johannes.  In her progress notes, she described Johannes as having no
    signs or symptoms of paranoia or psychosis.  She found him very appropriate,
    co-operative and with a great sense of humour.  During this assessment, he
    told the appellant that he had no intention of harming himself or anybody
    else, including his sister.  He also told the appellant that all of his behaviour
    at the hospital had been “staged and planned”.  She understood him to tell
    her that he had faked his psychosis.  She testified that she took this information
    with a grain of salt.  The appellant concluded on December 4 that Johannes
    probably did not meet the criteria for an involuntary patient at that time.  She
    decided to meet with Johannes the next day for further discussion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant met Johannes on December 5.  Her progress note presents a some-what
    mixed picture of the patient:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Patient seen again today.  Pleased he is finally
    released.  Good mood, pleasant, co-operative, but inappropriately flirtatious
    (jokingly insists we go for dinner).  Has plans about job, picking up his
    car, and restarting life.  No signs of delusions, paranoid thinking or psychosis.  Denies
    any suicidal or/and homicidal ideas…(illegible) or plans.  Alert and oriented – however
    remains provocative, macho and in [<i>sic</i>] the same time angry and fragile.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant concluded on December 5, 1996 that Johannes no longer met the criteria
    to be detained in the hospital as an involuntary patient.  She changed his
    status from involuntary to voluntary under the <i>Mental Health Act</i>.  In
    doing so, she considered a number of factors including: the patient’s general
    trend of improvement, his stated intention that he did not plan to harm himself
    or others, his response to medications, the decision of the Consent and Capacity
    Review Board, his previous admission to Scarborough General Hospital, consultations
    with other psychiatrists and conversations with his employer.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the appellant changed Johannes’ status to voluntary, she suggested that he
    remain in the hospital on a voluntary basis but he refused to do so.  He
    also declined to follow the appellant’s suggestion that he continue with
    a psychiatrist whom he had been seeing prior to his admission to Humber Memorial
    Hospital.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    Johannes left the hospital he moved back into his sister’s apartment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Johannes
    returned to Humber Memorial Hospital on more than one occasion to visit a
    female patient.  Such visits were disruptive and he was asked to leave the
    premises.  On one occasion, he was escorted off the premises by the police
    and spent the night in jail.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    January 21, 1997, Johannes attended at the North York General Hospital emergency
    department.  He was assessed by Dr. Weinstein, a psychiatrist.  Dr. Weinstein
    noted that Johannes was depressed.  He was also noted as being well dressed
    and articulate.  In response to questions from Dr. Weinstein, Johannes said
    that he was not capable of hurting himself or others.  Dr. Weinstein saw
    no indication of violence or potential for violence from Johannes on January
    21, 1997.  Dr. Weinstein concluded that Johannes did not meet the criteria
    for involuntary admission.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    January 22, 1997, Johannes attended at the Toronto General Hospital emergency
    department where he was seen by Dr. Lee, a Toronto General Hospital resident.  Dr.
    Lee reviewed his medical history, including his involuntary admission at
    Humber Memorial Hospital.  Johannes requested an immediate psychiatric consultation.  Dr.
    Lee declined to order a consultation because at that time she did not regard
    Johannes as a danger to himself or to others.  Dr. Lee assessed Johannes
    to be stable and opted to go with out-patient care.  Dr. Lee concluded, in
    consultation with her supervisor, Dr. Caravaggio, that Johannes did not meet
    the criteria for involuntary admission under the <i>Mental Health Act</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    January 24, 1997, Johannes murdered his sister at her apartment.  At the
    time that he murdered his sister, he was in a floridly psychotic, acutely
    delusional rage in which he believed that his sister was possessed by the
    devil.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE EXPERT EVIDENCE AT TRIAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to the appellant, a number of physicians were called as witnesses
    at the trial.  The respondents called two experts, Dr. Hector and Dr. Glumac.  Dr.
    Hector testified that the appellant failed to meet the standard of care expected
    of a psychiatrist in the circumstances of this case by completing a Form
    5 on December 5, 1996, and changing Johannes’ status to that of a voluntary
    patient.  Dr. Glumac offered a similar opinion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Shugar and Dr. Max testified on behalf of the appellant.  They testified
    that the appellant acted in an honest and intelligent manner and that she
    met the standard required of her in respect of her approach to Johannes.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is apparent that the jury accepted the evidence of Dr. Hector and Dr. Glumac
    in reaching its verdict.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raises three grounds of appeal:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i) The trial judge failed to instruct the jury
    properly on the law regarding the “honest and intelligent” exercise of judgment
    by a physician and failed to characterize properly certain admissions made
    by Dr. Hector in his evidence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii) The trial judge failed to instruct the jury
    properly on the law regarding clinical judgment that is supported by a
    “reputable body of opinion within the profession” and failed to characterize
    properly certain admissions made by Dr. Glumac in his evidence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii) The trial judge failed to instruct the jury
    properly on the issue of causation.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>It perhaps should be noted that
    “duty of care” was not raised as an issue in this appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(i)            The Honest and
      Intelligent Exercise of Judgment      </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the appellant submits that his client considered the appropriate factors
    in formulating her judgment as to whether Johannes met the criteria under
    the <i>Mental Health Act</i> for an involuntary patient on December 5, 1996.  He
    further submits that while the respondents’ expert witness, Dr. Hector, felt
    that the appellant put insufficient weight on some of the factors or different
    weight than Dr. Hector would have applied, he agreed that she exercised her
    judgment in an honest and intelligent fashion.  Counsel for the appellant
    relies upon the following statement from <i>Wilson v. Swanson,</i> [1956]
    S.C.R. 804 (S.C.C.) at 812: <i></i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>An error in judgment has long been distinguished
    from an act of unskillfulness or carelessness or due to lack of knowledge.  Although
    universally-accepted procedures must be observed, they furnish little or
    no assistance in resolving such a predicament as faced the surgeon here.  In
    such a situation a decision must be made without delay based on limited known
    and unknown factors; and the honest and intelligent exercise of judgment
    has long been recognized as satisfying the professional obligation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
    the above, counsel argues that the trial judge should have clearly instructed
    the jury that if they accepted that the evidence of Dr. Hector constituted
    an admission that the appellant exercised her medical judgment in an honest
    and intelligent fashion, she could not be found negligent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant relies upon the following evidence of Dr. Hector on cross-examination:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
    what I’m going to suggest, Dr. Hector, is that albeit you disagree with the
    weight or emphasis that she put on certain factors and therefore disagree
    with her judgment on December 5th to change Mr. Johannes’
    status to voluntary she did, to your knowledge, at least take into account
    all of the appropriate factors for her consideration.  Right?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Right.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
    she clearly made an attempt to kind of weigh all of those factors as a clinician
    must do to come to a proper determination in Mr. Johannes’ case?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
    albeit that you disagree with her ultimate decision, I take it you’d be prepared
    to concede that she did exercise her judgment in an honest and intelligent
    fashion?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
    certainly made her observations, and recorded those observations in the file.  And
    she states the purpose of her examination of the patient and does, as you
    suggest, conduct an examination one evening and again the following day.  And

    perhaps should be noted that in re-examination Dr. Hector said, in response
    to an obviously leading question by respondents’ counsel, that the appellant’s
    judgment did not meet the standard that he, Dr. Hector, would expect of an
    experienced psychiatrist and clinician in a psychiatric unit in Ontario.  </p>

    Hector, in arriving at his opinion that the appellant failed to meet the

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    described the expressed concern of a potential dangerousness in respect to
    this man and his family.  Such a description should have stood at the forefront
    of the appellant’s determination.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant should have recognized that the sexually inappropriate behaviour
    of the appellant which was documented through the course of his hospital

    December 4 and December 5 was fairly clear evidence of a continuing psychotic
    illness.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Hector also testified in cross-examination that the decision to decertify
    Johannes and allow him to take his own discharge was well outside what he,
    Dr. Hector, “would regard as her responsibilities as a psychiatrist’s responsibilities
    at that moment.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the issue of honest and intelligent exercise of judgment, the trial judge
    instructed the jury as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my opinion there is not a great deal of difference
    between this concept [of honest and intelligent exercise of judgment] and
    the concept of error in judgment.  Obviously, intelligent people can make
    mistakes.  And you can go about something in an intelligent way, but you
    got the wrong answer and you made a mistake, and you forgot something but
    you’re doing it intelligently – what’s the opposite of intelligent – well,
    I’m going to leave that to you.  Because someone is acting in an intelligent
    way does that mean they are exercising reasonable skill and care and diligence
    that’s required of them?  It doesn’t necessarily mean that unless in the
    evidence that that is shown as well.  If a medical practitioner exercises
    her judgment in an honest and intelligent fashion without lack of skill,
    without lack of skill or knowledge, and with a reasonable degree of care
    she should not be held liable merely because the judgment turned out to be
    wrong.  Another way, in my opinion, of – and certainly for you to understand,
    that’s the way I would explain it to you.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Now, you heard that exchange.  And my view, I’m
    not certain that he [Dr. Hector], in fact, went quite that far.  He certainly
    said that she conducted the treatment of Mr. Johannes in an excellent way,
    and that she did consider many factors.  Although she didn’t give weight
    to a lot of the factors – too much weight to other factors, but even assuming
    that he did go that far, in my view, he didn’t back down from the opinion
    that he gave that she should have given more weight to some factors and gave
    too much weight to others.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Now Mr. Black says to you: Once he said it was
    honest and intelligent that amounts to his opinion about breaching the standard
    of care being nullified.  Because if it’s honest and intelligent it’s mere
    error in judgment and therefore it can’t be a breach of the standard.  That’s
    for you to decide.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I thought Dr. Hector was very fair in his evidence.  He
    didn’t try to weasel, and when he was faced with questions on cross-examination
    I think he acknowledged when the situation was – when the circumstances dictated
    it that he may have changed his opinion on some things.  But I think he didn’t
    change his opinion on the key things that – that the best predictor of violence
    is past violent episodes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is my view that when Dr. Hector’s evidence is considered as a whole, there
    does not appear to be a straightforward admission that the appellant, in
    deciding to change Johannes’ status to that of a voluntary patient, was engaged
    in the honest and intelligent exercise of medical judgment.  What emerges
    from Dr. Hector’s testimony is that the appellant considered the appropriate
    factors but failed to appreciate, not just their weight but the clear message
    that should be taken from them, i.e. this patient should not be permitted
    to leave the hospital because of continuing psychotic illness and the opinion
    of the Consent and Capacity Review Board that he was likely to cause serious
    bodily harm to another person.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the trial judge’s instruction to the jury on this point may be somewhat confusing,
    I am not persuaded that it constitutes reversible error.  He outlined the
    evidence of Dr. Hector in respect of the exercise of honest and intelligent
    judgment and did so in the context of all his evidence.  On this record,
    I do not think he was required, nor was it open to him, to tell the jury
    that there was in fact an admission from Dr. Hector which, if accepted, would
    nullify a finding of negligence.  I appreciate that there is often a fine
    line between a mere error in judgment and a failure to meet the professional
    standard of care.  In my view, the jury could find that the line was crossed
    on the evidence in this case.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Right.  So
    the point is, then, that you’d expect there is a portion of the psychiatric

    for discharge as at December 5, 1996.  Right?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
    different psychiatrists have different opinions in these difficult judgments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge in his charge to the jury failed to
    instruct the jury on the significance of the evidence of Dr. Glumac.  Counsel
    further submits that the trial judge left with the jury the question of whether
    there was evidence of a reputable body of opinion which supported the approach
    taken by the appellant when he should have told them that there was such
    evidence.  In particular, the appellant argues that these errors are exhibited
    in the following excerpts from the judge’s charge:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>You heard Mr. Horowitz’s response to Mr. Black’s
    submission.  He says that the admission was based upon hypotheticals that
    were not borne out in the evidence of Dr. Stefaniu, and that there was no
    evidence called by the defendant that the opinions of Dr. Shugar and Dr.
    Max represented those of a reputable body of medical opinion.  Now, that’s
    going to be a matter for you to decide.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In conclusion, Dr. Glumac while recognizing that
    a mere error of judgment does not constitute a breach of the standard of
    care was of the opinion that Dr. Stefaniu was guilty of a series of cumulative
    errors in judgment which fell below the standard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the trial judge had said no more on this issue than is set out above, I would
    have no difficulty in concluding that his charge was insufficient.  However,
    the trial judge also gave the following instructions on this issue:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Now, we come to the respectable body of professional
    opinion.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The law in recognition of the fact that there are,
    in many instances, more than one right way of approaching a problem, has
    laid down that a doctor may not be found liable if the course that he or
    she followed was in conformity with a reputable body of medical opinion,
    even if it conflicts with the preponderant, the weightier body of medical
    opinion.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>So if you follow in your decision-making process,
    the judgment that would be exercised by a reputable body of professional
    opinion, there is always more than one way of skinning a cat and that’s acceptable.  Again,
    Mr. Black says that he extracted from Dr. Glumac a concession on cross-examination
    that Dr. Max and Dr. Shugar represented their opinion – that the opinion
    expressed by Dr. Max and Dr. Shugar represented the opinion of a reputable
    body within the psychiatric community.  He read to you the extract from his
    cross-examination of Dr. Glumac,…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>You will recall that I told you you are free to
    decide some or to accept some, all or none of a witness’ testimony.  It’s
    not an all or nothing affair.  If you come to the conclusion that Dr. Glumac’s
    evidence taken as a whole supported the proposition that there was a reputable
    body of opinion within the psychiatric community, which taking into consideration
    all the information available to and considered by Dr. Stefaniu would have
    made the same decision as she did, then you should find that according to
    Dr. Glumac Dr. Stefaniu did not breach the standard of care.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was no objection to the trial judge’s charge on this issue.  While failure
    to object at trial is not fatal to the success of the argument on appeal,
    it nevertheless is some indication that the judge’s charge was adequate.  In
    my view, the trial judge did not fail in his obligation to instruct the jury
    properly on this matter.</p>

    for the appellant submits that the trial judge failed to instruct the jury
    properly on the issue of causation.  Counsel’s position at the trial was
    that the respondents failed to show that the murder would not have occurred
    but for the alleged negligence of the appellant.  The argument is summarized
    as follows in the appellant’s factum:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Even if Johannes had met the criteria for involuntary
    status on December 5, 1996, and the Appellant’s decision to change his status
    to voluntary had fallen below the standard of care, by January 21 and 22,
    1997, nearly seven weeks later, Johannes did not meet the criteria for involuntary
    status.  Accordingly, his status would have been changed in any event prior
    to the date of the murder on January 24, 1997.  Therefore, even if the Appellant
    was found to have fallen below the standard required, her decision could
    not have been the cause of the plaintiffs’ damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the appellant argues that the trial judge paid very little time and attention
    to the issue of causation and treated it as being of secondary importance.  Counsel
    takes issue with the following observation of the trial judge as misleading:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There was, obviously, a causal connection between
    his being released and the actual murder, in the sense that if he was still
    in the hospital on January 24, 1997, he, obviously, wouldn’t have murdered
    Roslyn [Knipe].</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>However, the above excerpt should
    be considered with what followed from it:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There was, obviously, a causal connection between
    his being released and the actual murder, in the sense that if he was still
    in the hospital on January 24, 1997 he, obviously, wouldn’t have murdered
    Roslyn.  But the defendant (s) say, and I read it to you, they say another
    thing – they say: That even if the answer to question number 1 is “no”, I’m
    summarizing it, by January 21st and January 22nd, 1997 Mr. Johannes did not
    meet the criterion for involuntary status and his status would have to be
    changed, in any event, so he would have to be let go from the hospital by
    January 21st – let’s say January 22nd, and then he could have been free to
    kill his sister.  So they say the negligence of letting him go on December
    5th wasn’t the cause of the plaintiffs’ damages.  And, of course, in that
    respect, Mr. Black relies heavily on the evidence of Dr. Weinstein and I
    think Dr. Lee is her name, and you’ve heard that how he presented in the
    hospital on those occasions.  And you’ll read those discharge notes and the
    treatment notes; how he presented on the one occasion I think he said his
    life was falling apart, he’s having a breakdown; and the other how he felt
    it looked like depression.  It’s admitted that both of those doctors exercised
    due care and attention in carrying out his assessment, and they concluded
    that he wasn’t –
    or that he didn’t meet the criterion of involuntary admission.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>In my view, the above instruction
    fairly puts the appellant’s defence on the causation issue to the jury.  I
    also observe that counsel did not take objection to the trial judge’s charge
    on causation at trial.</p>

    respect of the causation issue, counsel for the appellant also objected to
    the trial judge’s characterization of the term,
    “foreseeable”.  There was a recharge on this issue.  The trial judge clarified
    what he meant by the use of the term, “foreseeable”.  In my view, there was
    no reversible error.  </p>

    oral argument, counsel for the appellant submitted that the jury’s verdict
    in respect of causation was unreasonable because there was no evidence to
    support such a finding.  I do not agree.  In my view, it was open to the
    jury to find on the basis of the evidence that but for the change in Johannes’ status
    to a voluntary patient on December 5, the murder of his sister would not
    have occurred.  The jury was entitled to reject the submission of counsel
    for the appellant, based on the evidence of the emergency room physicians,
    that Johannes’ status would have changed in any event prior to the date of
    the murder on January 25, 1997.  </p>

    respondents have submitted a bill of costs on a partial indemnity scale in
    the amount of $41,365 for fees, $1,767.67 for disbursements and $3,019.31
    for GST for a total of $46,151.98.  Three lawyers worked on this appeal.  Their
    total docketed hours are 144.7.  While I accept that those hours were expended,
    I am not persuaded that the respondents should recover their costs for all
    of them.  This was an appeal in which there were no complex legal issues.  The
    grounds of appeal were clearly defined.  The amount in issue in the appeal
    was $172,000.  In the circumstances, I do not agree that a total bill of
    $46,000 is fair and reasonable.</p>
