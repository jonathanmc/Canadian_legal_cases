    extraordinary, however, is his ability to organize his business affairs in a

    found that there is no distinction in law between the appellant corporations

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    London,
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region>
    ,
    to live together and have a family.  In
    exchange for her loss of income, he agreed to pay her the sum of $100,000 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
    ) plus $7,300 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">

    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Bahamas</st1:country-region>

    Bastedo referred to as the “extraordinary lengths [to which Mr. Segal went] to
    set up legal formulations which would have the effect of distancing himself in
    every possible way from any assets, corporations or trusts which could be
    connected to him”.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  Mr. Segal’s carefully honed practice is to
    set up intermediary vehicles in order to screen himself from creditors,
    including his spouses, and to use various aliases and pseudonyms to that end.  Substantial assets were held outside of
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    and those located in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    were held by nominees or nominee
    corporations that made it very difficult to trace them directly back to
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    and to
    Mr. Segal.  The trial judge noted that
    the documents created by Mr. Segal were just pieces of paper and did not prove
    what they appeared to create.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Lynch was not unaware of these practices on the
    part of Mr. Segal during their relationship.  In fact, he boasted about them.  At one point he informed Ms. Lynch that he wished to change a trustee in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Switzerland</st1:country-region>
    for another trustee who would obtain a witness for him to claim ownership in
    his assets, in court, if needed.  In
    1994, he took her to the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Channel Islands and
    introduced her to an English solicitor, Roger Dadd, who, he said, was involved
    in asset protection for him at the time.  Mr. Dadd is the person to whom the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario solicitor who incorporated the
    appellant corporations reported.  Mr.
    Segal also explained his <i>modus operandi</i> to Ms. Lynch.  It involved incorporating
    companies with only the bare necessities and formalities in place in order to
    make the incorporation valid.  Directors
    would be named, but shares would not be issued and blank shares would be held
    by the incorporator and trustee.  If a
    structure were ever challenged, the shares could be issued to create the
    impression that someone else owned the corporation and, thus, the asset in
    question.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found this was precisely the scheme
    utilised with respect to the appellant corporations, as well as with respect to
    certain other transactions in which Mr. Segal engaged to “whisk away” assets
    from Ms. Lynch.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants were incorporated by an
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario solicitor, Mr.
    Dolson, shortly before the acquisition of the respective tracts of land they
    hold, on instructions from Mr. Segal, who said he was representing a group of
    investors.  They were incorporated on
    behalf of unnamed beneficial owners, with no reporting letter, little
    correspondence and no notes in the file.  Mr. Dolson was instructed to appoint himself to be the sole shareholder,
    president and director of the corporations; to prepare and execute blank
    Nominee Agreements providing that the corporations held the Lands in trust for
    an undisclosed beneficial owner; to endorse the Share Certificates and Share Transfers
    in blank; and to execute resignations in respect of his positions as officer
    and director.  He was then instructed to
    send the incorporating documents, the Share Certificates, Share Transfers and
    Nominee Agreements, completed in blank form, together with the signed
    resignations, to the same Mr. Dadd, of the Isle of Guernsey, to whom Ms. Lynch
    had been introduced in 1994, as the man in charge of Mr. Segal’s protection
    scheme.  Shares of the appellants were
    issued in blank and held by unnamed nominees supposedly fronting for mysterious
    high-end foreign investors operating through the medium of international
    trusts.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This was the same ploy utilised by Mr. Segal in respect
    of the corporation holding title to the parties’ matrimonial mansion on Warren
    Road, and in respect of a further corporation (Sondol Wireless Connectivity
    Inc.) holding title to a third development tract of land in the Milton
    area.  In both of these cases, he was
    able to have the corporate structure of the companies altered quickly to make
    himself the president and controlling officer; he then effected the sale of the
    assets and transferred the sale proceeds into untouchable overseas
    accounts.  The sale of the matrimonial
    home ($2,700,000) took place shortly after the separation of the parties.  The Sondor sale ($2,500,000) took place
    later, in October 2003, and was in direct defiance of an order of Mesbur J.
    dated July 31, 2003 restraining Mr. Segal from depleting his assets.  That order had been served on Mr. Dolson
    prior to the Sondor sale.</p>

    nominee shareholder of the appellant corporations and that he represented the
    beneficial owners.  He said he knew who the
    beneficial owners were, and that Mr. Segal was not one of them, but that he
    could not reveal their identity without breaching his duty of confidentiality

    Anstock to testify as to other matters purportedly relating to the beneficial
    ownership of the shares of the appellants, when he refused to testify regarding
    the issues outlined above.  Although he
    found Mr. Anstock to be a person of integrity, he concluded that Mr. Anstock
    had been deceived by Mr. Segal, and gave no weight to his evidence.  At the conclusion of the appellants’ oral
    argument we saw no reason to interfere with the trial judge’s ruling and
    conclusion in this regard, and did not call upon the respondent to address this
    issue.  We agree with the trial judge’s
    observation that “to fail to indicate who the owner is when you give your
    opinion as to who the owner isn’t, is neither logical or fair”.  To permit such testimony would result in a
    situation where a witness could testify about half the story without telling
    the whole story.  This would potentially
    sanction a witness limiting his or her evidence to what is helpful to the case
    of the party calling the witness without exposing him or her to providing
    relevant evidence to the contrary that may be within the witness’
    knowledge.  See <i>Weslock v. Weslock</i>, 2003 CarswellOnt 4206 at para. 11(S.C.J.).</p>

    not-to-be-named high net worth individuals and families operating through
    international trust vehicles out of the Isle of Guernsey.  At most, they contended, the vesting order

    completion of oral argument and the reservation of our decision, however –
    after it had become apparent that the appeal with respect to the beneficial
    ownership interests had been lost – she unexpectedly appeared and sought leave

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>The vesting order
    itself is a creature of statute, although it has its origins in equitable
    concepts regarding the enforcement of remedies granted by the Court of
    Chancery.  Vesting orders were discussed
    by this court in <i>Chippewas of Sarnia Band v. Canada</i> (2000), 195 D.L.R.
    (4<span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New Roman"'>th</span>)
    135 at 227, where it was observed that:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>Vesting
    orders are equitable in origin and discretionary in nature.  The Court of Chancery made <i>in personam</i> orders, directing parties to deal with property in accordance with the judgment
    of the court.  Judgments of the Court of
    Chancery were enforced on proceedings for contempt, followed by imprisonment or
    sequestration.  <i>The statutory power to
    make a vesting order supplemented the contempt power by allowing the Court to
    effect the change of title directly</i>:  see McGhee, <i>Snell’s Equity</i> 30<span style='font-family:&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;

    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A vesting order,
    then, has a dual character.  It is on the
    one hand a court order (“allowing the court to effect the change of title
    directly”), and on the other hand a conveyance of title (vesting “an interest
    in real or personal property” in the party entitled thereto under the order)….</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The rationale for the vesting power, therefore, is to
    permit the court to direct the parties to deal with property in accordance with
    the judgment of the court.  The
    jurisdiction is quite elastic.  Nothing
    in the language of either section 100 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> or section 34(1)(c) of the <i>Family Law Act</i> operates to constrain the
    flexible discretionary nature of the power.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not think any useful purpose is served by
    attempting to categorize the types of circumstances in which a vesting order
    may issue in family law proceedings.  The
    court has a broad discretion, and whether such an order will or will not be
    granted will depend upon the circumstances of the particular case.  I agree with the appellants that the onus is
    on the person seeking such an order to establish that it is appropriate.  As a vesting order – in the family law
    context, at least – is in the nature of an enforcement order, the court will
    need to be satisfied (as the trial judge was here) that the previous conduct of
    the person obliged to pay, and his or her reasonably anticipated future behaviour,
    indicate that the payment order will not likely be complied with in the absence
    of more intrusive provisions: see <i>Kennedy
    v. Sinclair</i> (2001), 18 R.F.L. (5th) 91 (S.C.J.), affirmed (2003), 42 R.F.L.
    (5th) 46 (C.A.).  Thus, the spouse
    seeking the vesting order will have already established a payment liability on
    the part of the other spouse and the amount of that liability, and will need to
    persuade the court that the vesting order is necessary to ensure compliance
    with the obligation.</p>

line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, the court should be satisfied that there
    is some reasonable relationship between the value of the asset to be
    transferred and the amount of the targeted spouse’s liability and, of course,
    that the interests of any competing execution creditors or encumbrancers with
    exigible claims against the specific property in question are not an impediment
    to the granting of a vesting order.  However, I would not go so far as to say – as argued by the appellants –
    that the onus to satisfy the court on these matters is at all times on the
    person seeking the order.  I shall return
    to these issues later in these reasons.</p>

    law context, particularly where – as here – the corporations in question are
    completely controlled by one spouse, for that spouse’s benefit, and no third
    parties are involved.  The same situation
    arose in <i>Wildman, supra</i>.  In that case, Mr. Wildman operated a
    successful high-end landscaping business through a corporation and several sole
    proprietorships.  There were no
    third-party investors in the companies and Mr. Wildman controlled them
    completely.  In order to enforce the
    other parts of his order requiring Mr. Wildman to pay large sums of money for
    spousal and child support, the trial judge in that case directed that the
    amounts owing were to be secured by way of a charge not only against the
    appellant personally, but also against his companies. </p>

    the end, although a business person is entitled to create corporate structures
    and relationships for valid business, tax and other reasons, <i>the law must be vigilant to ensure that
    permissible corporate arrangements do not work an injustice in the realm of
    family law.  In appropriate cases,
    piercing the corporate veil of one spouse’s business enterprises may be an
    essential mechanism for ensuring that the other spouse and children of the

    this case is one in which it is appropriate to pierce the corporate veil.  During argument he observed that Mr. Segal
    was not using the appellant corporations for permissible corporate
    arrangements, but rather “was using the corporate structure for one sole
    purpose, to disguise his property so that his spouse and children would have no
    claim against him should he ever have to defend against a claim.”  In his reasons for judgment he referred to
    Mr. Segal’s scheme “to conceal his assets”, “to disguise [them] through every
    means possible”, and to create the impression that “someone other than he owned
    his property.”  The record supported these
    observations and findings.  In the circumstances,
    piercing the corporate veil, and finding that both the corporate shares and the
    Lands are beneficially owned by Mr. Segal, was – to adopt the language of
    MacPherson J.A. above – “an essential mechanism for ensuring that [Ms. Lynch]
    and [the] children of the marriage receive the financial support to which, by
    law, they are entitled.” </p>

    because they provide the foundation upon which the trial judge was able to make
    the vesting order that is challenged on appeal.  It is not because Mr. Segal was found to be the beneficial owner of the
    shares of Idyllic and Ashoe that the order may stand; it is because the trial
    judge found Mr. Segal to be the beneficial owner<i> of the Lands</i>.  Once it is
    accepted that <i>the Lands</i> belong to Mr.
    Segal, they become a fair target for a vesting order under section 34(1)(c) of
    the <i>Family Law Act</i> or section 100 of

    have touched on some of them earlier.  First, they attack the premise that the trial judge in fact made a
    finding that Mr. Segal is the owner of the Lands.  It follows from this, in their view, that the
    judgment should have provided for the vesting of <i>the shares</i> of the corporations in Ms. Lynch, if any vesting order
    were made, rather than stripping the underlying assets out of the corporations
    and transferring them directly to Ms. Lynch (without the liabilities – e.g.,
    capital gains tax – attending them within the corporations).  Secondly, they submit that the vesting order
    ought not to have been made without any valuation of the Lands in order to
    ensure that their value was sufficient to satisfy and protect the interests of
    the children in terms of their lump sum support awards.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    should have issued without Mr. Segal’s first wife, Leonor Segal, being made a
    party in order to protect her

    charging order against the shares or the Lands in lieu of the vesting order.</p>

line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree, respectfully, that the trial judge was not as
    clear as he might have been in articulating his finding that Mr. Segal is the
    beneficial owner of the Lands.  On
    reviewing his reasons as a whole, however, I have no doubt that he made such a
    finding – particularly when the reasons are read in conjunction with the oral
    argument of counsel that immediately preceded the rendering of oral
    judgment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In at least two places during the submissions of
    counsel for the appellants at trial the trial judge commented that “Mr. Segal
    is the beneficial owner of the lands and any intermediaries that he is using
    are puppets” and that “ the owner of the land – the owner of the company, is
    Moses, a.k.a. Moey Segal”.  Although he
    noted at one point in his reasons that the only significant issue to be tried
    in the action was whether the companies are owned by Mr. Segal or by some other
    unknown parties, the trial judge did not limit his findings to the
    determination that the appellants are beneficially and entirely owned by Mr.
    Segal.  He was alive to the central issue
    underlying the question of ownership of the corporations, namely, the use of
    the hidden ownership scheme to camouflage <i>Mr.
    Segal’s</i> ownership of the assets.  In
    the context of making the vesting order, the trial judge noted that “[t]he only
    evidence that somebody other than Mr. Segal <i>owns
    the land</i> is the self-serving statement made to Mr. Dolson” (which he did
    not accept).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, the trial judge made the following
    findings, which were amply supported on the evidence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In
    my view the limited companies and Mr. Segal are one and the same.  He is the beneficial owner <i>of the property</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I reject the submission that the trial judge made no
    finding that Mr. Segal was the beneficial owner of the underlying assets.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants also submit that it was inappropriate
    for the trial judge “to strip” the Lands out of the corporations and vest them
    directly in Ms. Lynch without regard for any capital gains tax obligations that
    may be attributable to appreciation in the value of the properties.  No doubt, a person taking title by way of a
    vesting order must take the property subject to any existing executions against
    it: <i>Re Maroukis and Maroukis</i> (1984),
    12 D.L.R. (4<span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New Roman"'>th</span>) 321 at 323 (S.C.C.).  Capital gains tax, however, is not an execution
    or encumbrance against the Lands.  The
    obligation to pay capital gains tax falls on the taxpayer owner of the property
    in question<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[4]</span></span></span></a> –
    in this case, technically, the appellant corporations.  Vesting the Lands – which the trial judge
    held to be beneficially owned by Mr. Segal – is no different than vesting any
    other asset belonging to him.  If the
    property vested is subject to pre-existing registered executions or
    encumbrances, the person taking title through the vesting order takes subject
    to those executions or encumbrances.  The
    person in whom the title vests, however, does not take subject to other
    personal obligations to which the previous owner may be subject.  Capital gains tax obligations fall into this
    latter category.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the trial judge was made aware of the appellants’
    “capital gains” submission.  Appellants’
    counsel at trial specifically brought it to the trial judge’s attention during
    argument, which was completed immediately prior to the judge’s delivery of his
    oral reasons.  Although he did not say so
    specifically, it is a fair inference from the trial judge’s reasons, and from
    his comments during argument that he concluded Mr. Segal (or the appellant
    corporations, which he equated with Mr. Segal) is in a position to defray
    whatever personal tax obligations might arise from the transfer in other
    ways.  I see no error in that approach.</p>

line-height:normal;page-break-after:avoid'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants next argued that no order should have
    been made vesting the Lands in Ms. Lynch because she led no evidence to
    establish the value of the Lands nor any evidence indicating some relative
    equivalence between the money judgments the Lands were to satisfy and the value
    of the Lands.  If the Lands are worth
    significantly more than the money judgments, Ms. Lynch will receive an undeserved
    windfall as a consequence of the vesting order.  If they are worth significantly less, then the court must, given its
    jurisdiction to protect children, ensure that it does not exchange a
    significant award for an empty recovery.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is the appellants, however, who were advancing the
    contention that the value of the Lands did not justify their exchange in
    satisfaction of the money judgment imposed by the trial judge.  They were in as good a position as Ms. Lynch –
    and arguably, a better position – to present evidence of the value of the
    Lands.  I do not think it is open to them
    to complain that there was no evidence of value in the circumstances of this
    case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, the trial judge had some evidence of
    value.  Working from the purchase prices
    of the two properties – $2.6 million, in the case of the Idyllic tract, and
    $1.636 million in the case of the Ashoe farm property – he concluded that there
    was “no rational risk … that the lump sum payment claimed would be exceeded by
    the value of the lands which are sought to be vested in satisfaction of that
    sum.”  Based on the record, he was
    entitled to draw that conclusion, and I would not interfere with it.  That disposes of the “windfall” concern.  It was also clearly open to the trial judge
    to conclude, as he did, that the only realistic way of ensuring the children
    would receive <i>any</i> recovery on the
    support order made in their favour – given Mr. Segal’s determination to avoid
    his obligations and, indeed, his outright defiance of earlier court orders – was
    to satisfy the money portion of the judgment out of the Lands.  In my view he was correct in doing so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I cannot help but make one further observation at this
    point.  While it is commendable of the
    appellants to address the concern that the best interests of the children be
    protected, the submission is somewhat disingenuous in the circumstances.  Given the trial judge’s finding that the
    appellants and Mr. Segal are “one and the same”, and given Mr. Segal’s complete
    abandonment of his children and his evident determination to avoid meeting any
    of his support obligations, the argument seems more directed towards saving the
    assets in his corporation than to providing for the best interests of the
    children.</p>

    days after oral argument on the appeal, when Ms. Segal suddenly entered the fray,
    registered her foreign judgments pursuant to the Act, and sought leave to
    intervene in the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As indicated earlier, we dismissed her motion for leave
    to intervene for separate reasons, <i>supra</i>,
    released on December 5, 2006.  In those
    reasons we canvassed the circumstances underlying the motion to intervene and
    concluded that it would not be fair or just to permit Ms. Segal to inject
    herself into the proceedings – of which she has been aware since 2003 – at this
    stage because any advantage that might be gained from her participation would
    be outweighed by the prejudice to Ms. Lynch in causing further delay.  Suffice it to say that we had no doubt it was
    Moses Segal who had instigated Ms. Segal’s initiative to become involved,
    notwithstanding his apparent absence from the proceedings and his professed
    lack of any connection to or control over the appellant corporations.  Nor did we have any doubt that Mr. Segal was
    animated by his avowed intention to practice a “scorched earth policy” and to
    ensure that anybody but Ms. Lynch take value from his properties.  This attitude was confirmed in an e-mail to
    Ms. Lynch, dated December 19, 2005, in which Mr. Segal said: “I think it is now
    time to invite U-NO-WHO from
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Montreal
    to the picnic.  She is not needy, but is
    very hungry, will eat a lot, and will never go away.”  On July 18, 2006 – one day after Leonor
    Segal’s motion for leave to intervene was filed – Mr. Segal sent another e-mail
    to Ms. Lynch.  This one said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>While

    with Ms. Segal’s
    <st1:State w:st="on">

    counsel (at Ms. Segal’s suggestion), that Ms. Segal was not going to pursue

    wealthier than Mr. Segal.  She and her

    creditor of Mr. Segal and that she is a necessary party to the determination of
    the vesting issue.  This is particularly
    so, they say, because both Ms. Lynch and Ms. Segal are judgment creditors with
    claims for spousal and child support.  They are therefore claimants entitled to equal priority over other
    judgment creditors – a right now entrenched in statute law in order to protect
    spouses and children and to ensure that their claims are satisfied in priority
    to those of other non-secured claimants: see the <i>Creditors’ Relief Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.45, s. 4.  Not to take
    into account Ms. Segal’s interests as a spousal judgment creditor when vesting
    the Lands in Ms. Lynch, the appellants submit, is to ignore the broad
    interjurisdictional statutory scheme that has been put in place by legislators
    across the continent to protect spouses and children.</p>

    Ontario at
    any relevant time in these proceedings.  Although she was well aware of Ms. Lynch’s lawsuit against her former
    husband, she had no enforceable encumbrance against any of his assets in this
    province.  Had she registered her Nevada
    judgments in Ontario prior to the trial and applied for intervention status at
    that stage, it may well be she would have succeeded, at least with respect to
    the issues concerning the ownership of the appellant corporations and their
    properties, and the matter of the vesting order.  As a registered spousal judgment creditor
    entitled to equal priority with Ms. Lynch over Mr. Segal’s property, she could
    be said to have an interest in those subject matters and to be a person who may
    be adversely affected by a judgment in relation to them.  However, she chose not to take any of these
    steps.</p>

    notice should be given in a particular case is a matter for a judge to
    determine.  However, I am not aware of
    any other statutory or legal prerequisite requiring Ms. Lynch to give notice of
    the details of her claim to Ms. Segal, an unregistered foreign judgment
    creditor; nor were we referred to any such authority by counsel.  Clearly, Ms. Segal’s interests would have been
    protected had she been a registered execution creditor.  Either she would have been entitled to
    receive notice and to participate in the proceedings or, at worst, Ms. Lynch
    would have taken the vested title in the Lands subject to her interest as an execution
    creditor.  Unfortunately for Ms. Segal,

    from vesting these particular Lands in Ms. Lynch in order to ensure payment of
    the particular orders for spousal and child support that he had made in the
    circumstances of this particular case.  For the reasons outlined above, I do not think he erred in that
    assessment.</p>

    in declining to vest the shares of the appellant corporations, rather than the
    Lands, in Ms. Lynch, or in refusing to make a charging order or grant some
    other remedy in lieu of a vesting order.  Once the finding was made that Mr. Segal is the beneficial owner of the
    shares <i>and</i> of the Lands, the decision
    whether to grant a vesting order pursuant to the <i>Family Law Act</i> or the <i>Courts

    party investors or shareholders – “no secret offshore investor whose identity
    needs to be protected” – whose interests in the appellant corporations might be
    affected by treating Mr. Segal and the corporations as “one and the same”, and
    by the finding Mr. Segal to be the beneficial owner of the Lands.  Any valid encumbrancers or registered
    execution creditors with an interest in the Lands at the time the vesting order
    was made are protected because Ms. Lynch takes title subject to such
    interests.  The trial judge was very
    alert to the reality that “[t]here is simply no possibility that Mr. Segal
    would ever pay child or spousal support willingly.”  He concluded Mr. Segal’s failure to comply
    with the interim support order of Justice Kitely in the proceedings and his
    deliberate evasion of Justice Mesbur’s order prohibiting him from dissipating
    his assets (the Sondor sale) were sufficient proof of that actuality.  He was also aware of the need to provide
    finality to the litigation, to the extent possible.</p>

    trial judge to reject alternative solutions and to opt, as he did, for a remedy
    that would in effect swap the monetary spousal and child support parts of the
    claim against Mr. Segal for the Lands.  This would ensure that at least a significant portion of Mr. Segal’s
    support obligations would be satisfied (on the evidence the trial judge was
    satisfied the value of the Lands would not be sufficient to meet those
    obligations fully).  He was convinced
    that without the vesting order Ms. Lynch and the children would likely receive
    nothing.  He concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In
    my view the claim for vesting of those lands, in lieu of any excess claim for

    range of reasonable options at his disposal.</p>

    shares or the Lands, instead of a vesting order, would have left control of the
    appellant corporations in the hands of Mr. Segal, who is a self-confessed
    master at manoeuvring and manipulating his corporate vehicles in order to
    frustrate and defeat the interests of his former spouses, his children, and his
    creditors generally.  At worst, he could
    devise a means of stripping the assets out of the corporations and spiriting
    them away for his personal benefit, as he did in the Sondor transaction.  At best, he could take steps to delay Ms.
    Lynch’s ability to recover on the charging order and put her to further expense
    in pursuance of his “scorched earth policy”.  The trial judge was right in rejecting such a proposal. </p>

    appellant corporations in Ms. Lynch would ultimately put control of the
    corporations in her hands, a series of corporate steps would have to be taken
    before that control would become a reality and, in any event, such a remedy
    might not be as effective in satisfying Mr. Segal’s support obligations because
    of the capital gains tax implications referred to above.  As long as there are corporate steps that
    have to be taken, there are opportunities for Mr. Segal and the appellant
    corporations to be mischievous and to attempt to put obstacles in the way of
    Ms. Lynch’s attempts to enforce her spousal and child support orders.  As to the tax considerations, Mr. Segal is
    obviously in a position to cope with any personal or corporate tax liabilities
    that he may be compelled to pay, whereas he will not willingly satisfy his
    support obligations.  The choice of an
    order vesting the Lands, which he beneficially owns, instead of the shares, is

    allowable capital losses for the year from dispositions of property other than
    listed personal property exceed the taxpayer’s allowable business investment
    losses for the year.  A taxpayer includes
    a corporation: s. 248(1).  Section 38(a)
    defines a taxpayer’s taxable capital gain for a taxation year from the
    disposition of any property as one-half of the taxpayer’s capital gain from the
    year from the disposition of property.  As these provisions illustrate, the obligation to pay capital gains tax
    is taxpayer-focused, rather than property-focused.</span><span
