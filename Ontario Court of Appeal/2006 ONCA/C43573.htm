    appeal invites this court to consider the scope and application of s. 38(2)(f)
    of the <i>Public Transportation and Highway Improvement Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. P.50 (the <i>P.T.H.I.A.</i>).</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    March 2005, Essex 143 Joint Venture Ltd. (the developer) applied for an order
    determining its rights under s. 38(2)(f) of the <i>P.T.H.I.A.</i>  In particular,
    it asked whether it had to obtain a permit from the Minister of Transportation
    before it could proceed with a proposed residential subdivision located within
    800 metres of a controlled-access highway.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    order dated April 28, 2005, the application judge granted declarations that
    a residential development is not a use of land that is subject to the Minister’s
    approval pursuant to s.&nbsp;38(2)(f)<span
style='font-size:12.5pt;'> of the </span><i>P.T.H.I.A.</i> and that the developer
    was permitted to proceed with its residential development without a permit
    from the Minister under s. 38(2)(f).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    province appeals the order on several bases, including that the application
    judge erred by incorrectly characterizing the development as being residential
    when the uncontradicted evidence established that it was the residential
    phase of a mixed-use (residential/commercial) development.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    reasons that follow, I would grant the appeal, set aside the application
    judge’s order and substitute in its stead, a declaration that the respondent
    requires a permit under s. 38(2)(f) of the <i>P.T.H.I.A.</i> prior to proceeding
    with the proposed residential subdivision.  In my view, the application judge
    framed the issue too narrowly.  The facts of this case required him to consider
    the context in which the residential development was proceeding.  This context
    included the fact that the residential development was a part of a mixed-use
    development that had already received a permit allowing the first commercial
    phase of the development to proceed.</p>

line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    part of the ongoing communication between the developer and the Ministry
    of Transportation, the developer advised that it wished to proceed with the
    development of the property in phases.  Phase 1 concerned a commercial use
    portion of the development, consisting of a grocery store, a Canadian Tire
    store and an automobile dealership, as well as the associated parking.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    response to the developer’s application for a permit under s.&nbsp;38(2)
    of the <i>P.T.H.I.A.</i> to proceed with phase 1, the Ministry of Transportation
    advised that, prior to issuing a permit for the phase 1 portion of the development,
    certain improvements to an intersection had to be carried out.  The Ministry
    indicated to the developer that once an agreement was reached on the required
    improvements, the Ministry preferred entering into an agreement with the
    Town of Essex for funding and implementing the improvements and the Town
    could then recover these costs from the developer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Agreement
    was then reached on the needed improvements and, as proposed by the Ministry,
    it entered into a June 30, 2004 agreement with the Town of Essex to fund
    and implement the improvements to the intersection required to allow phase
    1 to proceed.  Significantly, a recital in that agreement stipulated that
    the development, defined as the entire parcel, came within the permit provisions
    of the <i>P.T.H.I.A.</i>  The agreement also provided that the permit that
    was to be issued authorizing phase 1 would have annotated to it the stipulation
    that the permit was subject to the terms of the June 30, 2004 agreement.  On
    the record before us, it does not appear that the developer challenged the
    Ministry’s inclusion of this condition to the issuance of the permit for
    phase 1.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    proceeding with the commercial phase of the mixed-use development, the developer
    determined to proceed with the residential phase.  The residential phase
    involves approximately 400 residential units on eighty-three acres of the
    site.  Rather than applying for the issuance of a permit pursuant to s.&nbsp;38(2)(f)
    of the <i>P.T.H.I.A.,</i> the developer brought the present application.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Position

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      the application, the developer took the position that s.&nbsp;38(2)(f)
      of the </span><i>P.T.H.I.A.</i> has no application to residential uses
      and that it applies only to land located within 800 metres of a controlled
      access highway where the land was to be used as “a shopping centre, stadium,
      fairground, racetrack, drive-in theatre or any other purpose that causes
      persons to congregate in large numbers”.  It argued that the phrase “any
      other purpose that causes persons to congregate in large numbers” should
      be read in the context of the listed purposes.  According to the developer,
      the common theme of the listed purposes was that they would all cause large
      numbers of people to exit the premises at the same time, thereby causing
      traffic congestion.  The proposal to build residences on eighty-three acres
      of the site was therefore outside of the scope of the Act.</p>

line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    province submitted that the general purpose of the <i>P.T.H.I.A.</i> is to
    control traffic and that the Minister’s discretion to refuse or grant a permit
    must be exercised having regard to traffic planning requirements (see: <i>Re
    Multi-Malls Inc. v. Ontario (Minister of Transportation and Communications)</i> (1977),
    14 O.R. (2d) 49 (C.A.)).  It then took the position that:</p>
  <p align=left style='

'>(a)  under s. 38(2)(f) of the <i>P.T.H.I.A.</i>, the entire 140 acre mixed-use

  <p align=left style='

'><span lang=EN-US>(b)</span><span lang=EN-US>  in any event, the proposed residential

      is not required within the provisions of s. 38(2)(f)” of the <i>P.T.H.I.A.</i>,
      the application judge, in my view, framed the issue too narrowly.  The
      issue before him was not whether s.&nbsp;38(2)(f) of the <i>P.T.H.I.A.</i> contemplated
      that a residential development in the nature of the developer’s proposed
      residential phase, as a stand alone project, would require a permit from
      the Minister of Transportation.  Rather, the issue was whether, on the
      facts of this case, the residential phase of the mixed-use development
      required a permit before the developer could proceed.  The residential
      phase of the project could not be dealt with in isolation.  I say this
      for two reasons.</span></p>

      was contemplated from the outset that the residential portion of the development
      would be part of one single mixed commercial/residential project.  The
      conduct of both the developer and the Ministry of Transportation was consistent
      with this approach.</span></p>

      developer represented the project as a mixed-use development in the original
      contact made with the Ministry by its transportation planning consultant
      in March 2000.  The developer continued to take this position throughout
      the process of amendment to the official plan and in the application for
      the phase 1 permit. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Ministry also considered the whole of the development as one project.  It
    is apparent that, from the Ministry’s perspective, phase 1 approval was granted
    on the understanding that the developer would prepare a traffic impact study
    and apply for permits before proceeding with any further phase of the development.  The
    Ministry did indicate that the actual traffic volumes experienced at the
    intersection as a result of having proceeded with phase 1 may well impact
    on the need for additional highway improvements to support further phases.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further,
      the Ministry of Transportation consistently responded to the developer
      on the basis that the whole of the development was subjected to the permit
      requirements of the </span><i>P.T.H.I.A.</i>  This position is reflected
      in the agreement entered into between the Minister and the Town of Essex
      that allowed phase 1 to proceed.  As I noted previously, this agreement
      specified that the permit issued to the developer for phase 1 would be
      made subject to the terms of the agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    making the phase 1 permit subject to the terms of the agreement between the
    Town of Essex and the Ministry served to confirm that the permit requirements
    of s. 38(2)(f) of the <i>P.T.H.I.A.</i> extended to all phases of the mixed-use
    development.  The imposition of terms and conditions on the issuance of a
    permit is authorized by s. 38(11) of the <i>P.T.H.I.A.</i>  In my view, by
    making the permit subject to the terms of the agreement between the Town
    of Essex and the Ministry, these terms became “terms and conditions” of the
    permit as contemplated by s. 38(11).  The imposition of those terms and conditions
    was not challenged by the developer and they must therefore be complied with.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Specifically,
    the recital in the agreement that the
    “development [meaning the full 140 acres] comes within the scope of the permit
    provisions of sections 2, 38(2)(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and 38(11), of
    the [<i>P.T.H.I.A.</i>]”, when considered in the light of the Ministry’s
    and developer’s consistent position to that point that it was a mixed-use
    project, clearly indicates that the approval of the permit for phase 1 was
    given on the understanding and condition that the developer obtain permits
    for all future phases of that mixed-use development.  The developer cannot
    now seek to disaggregate the mixed development and proceed with each portion
    of the development as a separate stand-alone project.</p>

    reached this conclusion, it is not necessary for me to determine whether,
    standing alone, a residential development of the type proposed by the developer
    would fall within the terms of s. 38(2)(f) of the <i>P.T.H.I.A.</i> or whether,
    when one phase of a development requires a permit, the Act allows the Minister
    to require that all phases of the development be subject to permits.</p>
