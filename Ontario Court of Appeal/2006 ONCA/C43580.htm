style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    July 16, 2004, the appellant pleaded guilty to robbery, kidnapping, sexual
    assault and arson. The appellant was 17 years old at the time these offences
    were committed. However, following a transfer hearing under the <i>Youth
    Criminal Justice Act</i>, the charges were moved to adult court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    August 31, 2004, after giving the appellant two and one-half years credit
    for 18 months presentence custody, Mitchell J. sentenced the appellant to
    four years imprisonment for kidnapping, four years imprisonment concurrent
    for robbery, one year imprisonment concurrent for arson and two and one-half
    years imprisonment consecutive for sexual assault. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the purpose of this sentence appeal, the underlying facts of the offences
    are important. On February 4, 2003, the appellant and his 16-year-old co-accused
    were drinking  rum at a mall in Hamilton when they decided to commit a robbery
    to obtain bus money. At about 9:00 p.m. on that date the appellant approached
    the victim as she was opening her car door in the parking lot of the mall
    and asked the time. The victim was a 66-year-old women on her way home from
    work at one of the stores in the mall. Once the victim had entered her car
    the appellant punched her in the eye, shoved her into the passenger seat
    and then entered the vehicle with the co-accused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant told the victim that he had a gun and threatened to harm her if
    he could not get the car started. Over the next two to three hours he and
    the co-accused confined the victim to her car and drove from ATM machine
    to ATM machine in Hamilton and Burlington in an effort to rob the victim
    of her money. In order to obtain the victim’s PIN number, the perpetrators
    told her they would shoot her son. Ultimately, they obtained over $1,300
    in cash. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    each occasion that the perpetrators approached an ATM machine it was the
    co-accused who left the vehicle and attempted to obtain the cash. While the
    co-accused was absent from the vehicle, the appellant sexually assaulted
    the victim on several occasions. During the first assault, the appellant
    demanded that the victim give him a blow job, threatened to rape her if she
    did not do so and at one point forced her head onto his penis. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the second assault the appellant forcibly removed the victim’s clothing and
    attempted to rape her. Subsequently, after moving the vehicle, the appellant
    forced the victim to commit fellatio on him and ejaculated into her mouth
    and onto her coat. The perpetrators then drove the victim into the countryside,
    stole her purse and identification, forced her into a ditch and left her
    to fend for herself in minus 16 degrees Celsius weather.  In accordance with
    a plan made with the appellant, the co-accused later poured gasoline into
    the victim’s vehicle and destroyed it by setting it on fire. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time these offences were committed, the appellant had a prior record
    for assault, robbery and two counts of failing to comply with a recognizance
    and was subject to two probation orders in relation to those offences. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on submissions that the sentence imposed was harsh and excessive, and that
    the sentencing judge failed to give adequate weight to various mitigating
    factors and erred in the application of certain sentencing principles, the
    appellant seeks leave to appeal sentence and asks that the sentence be reduced
    to time served or at least to a substantially shorter period of incarceration. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    our review of the record, the trial judge gave careful consideration to the
    circumstances of this offence, the circumstances of this offender and the
    relevant sentencing principles. While the trial judge imposed a sentence
    that we consider to be at the high end of the range for a youthful offender,
    taking account of all of the circumstances of this case, and having reviewed
    all of the fresh evidence submitted, including the evidence filed today,
    we do not consider the sentence imposed to be outside the range or manifestly
    unfit or that it failed to give adequate weight to the appellant’s rehabilitation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    in our view, on the facts of this case it was open to the sentencing judge
    to impose consecutive sentences. Moreover, the sentencing judge did not err
    in imposing a sentence that significantly exceeded that received by the co-accused
    who was sentenced to the maximum available term under the <i>Youth Criminal
    Justice Act</i> and which the sentencing judge in that case described as
    lenient. Importantly, the co-accused did not participate in the sexual assault. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the credit given for pre-sentence custody was within the trial
    judge’s discretion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    all of the circumstances, while leave to appeal sentence is granted, the
    sentence appeal is dismissed.</p>
