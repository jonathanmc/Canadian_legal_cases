  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>GILLESE J.A.:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Does
    s.&nbsp;66(1) of the <i>Pension Benefits Act </i>preclude the appointment
    of an equitable receiver to collect pension benefits in satisfaction of a
    civil judgment?  Can an equitable receiver be appointed to collect death
    benefits?  This appeal addresses both questions.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Lettroy began working for the Workers Compensation Board<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a> (the “Board”) in 1968.  He continued
    to work for the Board until 1992.  In 1991, he conspired with the other named
    defendants and exploited his position with the Board to issue Board cheques,
    totalling over $1.1 million, to three illegitimate recipients.  The cheques
    were cashed and monies wrongfully retained by the recipients of the cheques
    and the other defendants.  Mr. Lettroy was dismissed, for cause, in April
    1992 and later convicted of and incarcerated for fraud.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Board brought an action against the defendants and, ultimately, obtained
    default judgment against Mr. Lettroy for the full sum.  After determining
    that Mr. Lettroy’s only realisable asset was his employment pension, the
    Board obtained an order from Hawkins J., dated October 12, 1994, (“the original
    order”) authorizing the appointment of a private equitable receiver to collect
    funds held by the Worker’s Compensation Board Employees’ Superannuation Fund
    (“the pension plan”) in trust for Mr. Lettroy and to pay those funds to the
    Board in satisfaction of its judgment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    original order does not make the appointment of the equitable receiver immediate.  Rather,
    it provides that the receiver is to be appointed to collect Mr. Lettroy’s
    pension either in 2007, when he was entitled to begin receiving normal pension
    benefits, or, if Mr. Lettroy exercised his option to receive early retirement
    benefits, at the early retirement date.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants are Mr. Lettroy’s three children and his spouse.  None were given
    notice of the original motion; no one opposed it.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time of his death, Mr. Lettroy was living separate and apart from his
    spouse and had been for several years.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a>    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Lettroy died before he was entitled to begin receiving his pension.  Consequently,
    the pension to which he was entitled became payable as a death benefit in
    the lump sum of $445,738.33.  Because the original order did not cover this
    situation, the trustee of the pension plan was hesitant to pay out the lump
    sum to the private equitable receiver.  So, the Board moved to have the original
    order amended to provide for payment to the receiver of any funds that became
    due and payable as a result of Mr.&nbsp;Lettroy’s death (the “motion”).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants intervened to oppose the motion and lay claim to the funds.  Their
    claim was based on a beneficiary designation that Mr. Lettroy executed in
    1988 in which he designated his three children and his mother, Beatrice Lettroy
    Stephen, as beneficiaries of the death benefits payable under the pension
    plan.  The fourth beneficiary, Beatrice Lettroy Stephen, was deceased at
    the time of the motion.  I will refer to the three children, who are both
    appellants and the surviving designated beneficiaries, as the “designated
    beneficiaries”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants learned of the original order only when served with the materials
    for the motion, heard by Day J., in August of 2004.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge saw the pivotal issue in the motion as who had ownership of
    Mr. Lettroy’s pension benefits at the time of the original motion.  He considered
    whether, at the time of the original order, the designated beneficiaries
    had an interest in the pension plan.  In para. 17 of his reasons, he concluded
    they did not and, consequently, that Mr. Lettroy’s interest in the pension
    benefits was subject to equitable execution, saying:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[A]t the time of the original motion before Hawkins
    J., all interest in the pension plan belonged to Lettroy and to no one else;
    the claimants had no ownership interest in the benefits when dealt with in
    1994.  This being the case, the pension benefits could be subjected to equitable
    execution as Justice Hawkins ordered in the first instance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge then considered whether it was appropriate to appoint an equitable
    receiver under s. 101 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;C.43,
    the relevant part of which provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the Superior Court of Justice, … a receiver …
    may be appointed … where it appears to a judge of the court to be just or
    convenient to do so. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge recognized that, had an equitable receiver not been appointed
    in the original order, the designated beneficiaries “would most certainly
    be entitled to the benefits”.  However, having found that Mr. Lettroy was
    solely entitled to the pension benefits at the time of the original order
    and, as he was of the view that the designated beneficiaries claimed only
    through Mr. Lettroy, he concluded that the designated beneficiaries could
    not avoid the appointment of the equitable receiver.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    order dated April 21, 2005, the motion judge granted the Board’s motion and
    extended the original order to apply to the death benefits.  The appellants
    appeal that order (the “order under appeal”).       </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    primary issue to be addressed on this appeal is whether the motion judge
    erred in varying the terms of the original order so as to authorize the equitable
    receiver to collect Mr. Lettroy’s death benefits and pay them to the Board.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    secondary issue is whether the motion judge erred in failing to set aside
    or vary the original order.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants maintain that it was not open to the motion judge to make the
    order under appeal.  Their position rests on two main arguments.       </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first argument is based on s. 66(1) of the <i>Pension Benefits Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. P.8, which exempts pension benefits from execution.  Section 66(1)
    reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>66(1) Money payable under a pension plan is exempt
    from execution, seizure and attachment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    virtue of s. 66(4) of the <i>Pension Benefits Act</i>, support orders enforceable
    in Ontario are specifically excepted from the operation of s. 66(1) to a
    maximum of one-half of the money payable.  However, that exception has no
    application in the instant case as the Board is attempting to enforce a civil
    judgment.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants say that the appointment of an equitable receiver is a type of
    execution and, therefore, is precluded by virtue of s. 66(1).  Although the
    motion judge purported to rely on s. 101 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> when
    amending the original order, the appellants say that was not open to him
    because it cannot be just or convenient to appoint an equitable receiver
    to achieve a result that is in conflict with the applicable legislation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellants say that the pension plan dictates how death benefits are
    to be distributed and the court cannot interfere with that scheme of distribution
    through the interposition of an equitable receiver.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    accept both of these contentions.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Appointment of an Equitable
      Receiver over Pension Benefits</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In
    my view, this court’s decision in <i>Hooper v. Hooper</i> (2002), 59 O.R.
    (3d) 787, is a full answer to whether an equitable receiver could be appointed
    to collect Mr. Lettroy’s pension benefits.  In <i>Hooper v. Hooper</i>, a
    husband failed to make support or equalization payments.  His only source
    of income was his pension plan.  The motion judge found that the husband
    had “shown a callous disregard” both for the court orders and his former
    wife.  He appointed an equitable receiver to receive the husband’s pension
    benefits and pay them to the wife.  Fifty per cent of the benefits were to
    discharge the husband’s equalization obligations and fifty per cent were
    to discharge his support obligations.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice
    Goudge, speaking for the Court, set aside the order.  The breadth of the
    language used in the reasons makes it clear that his reasoning is not restricted
    to matrimonial matters.  At paras. 44 and 51, he states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Thus, in general, this legislation [the<i> Pension
      Benefits Act, </i>s.&nbsp;66(1)] makes pension payments immune from execution
      and assignment.  The only exceptions relate to certain orders made against
      the pensioner pursuant to the <i>Family Law</i> <i>Act</i>&nbsp;…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The order appointing the respondent as equitable
    receiver is not an example of the court using its equitable jurisdiction
    to circumvent a common law obstacle of its own making.  Rather, that order
    would effect a result which, for clear policy reasons, the legislation prohibits,
    namely the enforcing of the equalization order of Fedak J. against the appellant’s
    pension payments.  In my view, however strong the equities might otherwise
    be, it is not just or convenient in these circumstances to appoint an equitable
    receiver to achieve a result which is in direct conflict with the applicable
    legislation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later
    in the reasons in <i>Hooper</i>, Goudge J.A. refers with approval to <i>Beattie
    v. Ladouceur</i> (1995), 23 O.R. (3d) 225 (Gen. Div.).  In <i>Beattie</i>,
    Rutherford J. reviewed an order appointing an equitable receiver over the
    defendant’s pension benefits in order to enforce spousal support.  He set
    aside the order on the basis that the relief was beyond the court’s jurisdiction.  Although
    the decision in <i>Beattie </i>is based on federal legislation that exempted
    pension benefits from execution either “at law or in equity”, Rutherford
    J.’s explanation of the broader principles at play are equally applicable
    in the instant case.  At pp. 231 - 32 of <i>Beattie</i>, he says:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he courts of equity fashioned equitable remedies
    to achieve justice which was unattainable largely because of the rigidity
    of legal remedies which were the creatures of the courts of law.  Here, where
    Parliament has fashioned statutory remedies and placed limitations on those
    remedies with great specificity, I think it is the proper role of the courts
    to apply and maintain those remedies, including their limitations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice
    Rutherford found that the appointment of an equitable receiver amounted to
    an “indirect attachment” or “extra-legislative garnishment”
    which conflicted with the legislative prohibition against assignment or attachment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    making the order under appeal, the motion judge did not refer to <i>Hooper
    v. Hooper</i>.  Instead, he relied on the decision of the Divisional Court
    in <i>Simon v. Simon</i> (1984), 45 O.R. (2d) 534.  However, <i>Simon</i> is
    distinguishable from the present case.  In <i>Simon</i>, in order to satisfy
    a support order made under the then governing family law legislation, an
    equitable receiver was appointed to collect future pension benefits when
    they became due.  Under the applicable legislation, the pension plan member’s
    spouse was entitled to fully satisfy her support order from the pension benefits,
    once they were payable, by way of execution, seizure or attachment. Thus,
    the appointment of the equitable receiver was not in direct conflict with
    s. 27(1) of the <i>Pension Benefits Act</i>, R.S.O. 1980, c. 373, the predecessor
    provision to s.&nbsp;66(1).    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent’s main argument on this issue is that, in the absence of an express
    provision that abrogates the right to equitable relief, case law in Ontario
    demonstrates that the court has the jurisdiction to appoint an equitable
    receiver where “just or convenient”.  Thus, the argument runs, the court
    has the jurisdiction to impose the equitable remedy of an equitable receiver
    because, unlike the comparable federal legislation, s. 66(1) does not expressly
    preclude execution “at law or in equity”.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    making this argument, the respondent relies particularly on <i>Simon</i> at
    p. 538, where Henry J. states that he invokes “an equally important principle
    of statutory interpretation that a statute is not to be taken to abrogate
    or impair a right to equitable relief unless it does so in clear terms” (“this
    statement” or “the statement”).  He concluded that, as s. 27(1) lacked the
    expression “at law or in equity”, it was not a bar to the appointment of
    an equitable receiver.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am not persuaded that the statement is correct.  I share the view expressed
    in the above quoted passages from <i>Hooper </i>and <i>Beattie </i>that equity
    devised mechanisms to circumvent the rigidity of the common law, not to undermine
    legislation.  I note that Henry J. referred to no authority when making this
    statement.  It may be that he was referring to the notion, as set out in <i>Snell’s
    Equity </i>31st ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 2005) at 12, that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[W]here a general equitable jurisdiction has been
    developed, and Parliament steps in with legislation in a particular area,
    the general jurisdiction is not to be regarded as cut down or abrogated by
    implication, save in the particular area which is the subject of the legislation.    [footnotes
    omitted]   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the principle as enunciated in Snell, does not apply here.  In my view, that
    principle refers to situations in which a well-recognized equitable right
    exists and legislation is then enacted that could be interpreted as affecting
    those rights.  In construing the legislation, one principle of statutory
    interpretation that comes into play is the notion that legislatures do not
    intend to interfere with rights and that clear language is necessary to remove
    such rights.  In the instant case, there was no generally recognized equitable
    right over pension benefits prior to the passage of s. 66(1) such that the
    legislature had to add the words
    “at law or in equity” to s. 66(1), in order to achieve its purpose of exempting
    pension benefits from execution, seizure and attachment.  </p>

    of the other cases relied on by the respondent are helpful to its case.  Most
    are explicable on the basis that they are first instance decisions decided
    before <i>Hooper</i>, in reliance on the statement in <i>Simon</i>.  See,
    for example, <i>Lavigne v. Robern </i>(1986), 56 O.R. (2d) 385 (H.C.J.) and <i>Nicholas
    v. Nicholas</i>, [1998] O.J. No. 1750 (Ct. J. (Gen. Div.).  Others are not
    of assistance as the receivers were appointed to collect something other
    than pension benefits and so s. 66(1) (or its predecessor) did not apply.  For
    example, in <i>McMaster Savings Credit Union v. Sheahan</i>, [2003] O.J.  No.
    1346 (Sup. Ct.), a receiver was appointed to collect an annuity, not pension
    benefits.  And, in <i>Martin v. Martin </i>(1981), 33 O.R. (2d) 164 (H.C.J.),
    a receiver was appointed to collect the wages of a federal civil servant,
    not his pension benefits.    </p>

    my view, the principle enunciated in <i>Hooper v. Hooper </i>is operative – it
    is neither just nor convenient to appoint an equitable receiver to achieve
    a result that is in direct conflict with the applicable legislation.  As
    the benefits that accrue from Mr. Lettroy’s membership in the pension plan
    fall within the scope of the protection created by s. 66(1) and are not covered
    by one of the exceptions, it could not be just or convenient to appoint an
    equitable receiver over them pursuant to s. 101 of the <i>Courts of Justice

    short, the terms of the pension plan require that the death benefits arising
    from Mr.&nbsp;Lettroy’s membership in the pension plan be paid to his designated
    beneficiaries in the circumstances of this case.  On a plain reading of s.
    32 of the Regulation, the designated beneficiaries are entitled to receive
    the death benefits given that Mr. Lettroy designated them as beneficiaries,
    he died before retirement and he was living separate and apart from his spouse
    at the time of his death.        </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    in 1994 when the original order was made, both Mr. Lettroy and the designated
    beneficiaries had an interest in the pension benefits to which Mr. Lettroy
    was entitled under the pension plan.  As he had executed a beneficiary designation
    at that time, three scenarios existed.  First, Mr. Lettroy might receive
    the pension benefits by way of pension beginning on his normal retirement
    date.  Second, if he so chose, he could retire early and begin to receive
    his pension at the date of early retirement.  Third, if he died before the
    pension was in pay and, at the time of death he had no surviving spouse or
    he was living separate and apart from his spouse, the lump sum value of the
    pension would be paid to his designated beneficiaries.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    common parlance, Mr. Lettroy owned his pension.  That is, he was entitled
    to receive his pension as of right.  However, the designated beneficiaries
    owned something as well -- the right to receive the death benefits (the commuted
    value of the pension benefits) in the event of Mr. Lettroy’s death before
    retirement, provided there was no spousal entitlement.  The designated beneficiaries’
    right, however, could be defeated in the event that Mr. Lettroy changed his
    mind and designated other beneficiaries.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    strict legal parlance, their interests were as follows.  The trustee or administrator
    of the pension plan held legal title to the pension money.  Mr. Lettroy had
    a vested equitable interest in the pension benefits but possession (<i>i.e</i>.
    receipt of the pension benefits) was postponed to the date of his retirement,
    whether normal or early.  Mr. Lettroy’s right to receive the pension benefits
    was defeasible on the event of his death prior to retirement, whether normal
    or early.  The designated beneficiaries had a contingent equitable right
    to the pension benefits in the form of the lump sum death benefit, defeasible
    on the exercise of Mr. Lettroy’s right to name other beneficiaries.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is not correct, as the appellants maintained below, that Mr. Lettroy’s interest
    was contingent on him being alive at the date of his retirement.  His right
    to the pension benefit vested after 24 months of continuous membership in
    the pension plan.  That is, Mr. Lettroy’s entitlement was not contingent
    on him being alive at retirement date.  His death had an effect on who received
    the funds, not whether he was entitled to them.  Had he not named designated
    beneficiaries, the lump sum value of the commuted pension benefits would
    have gone to his estate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    Mr. Lettroy was not solely entitled to the pension benefits at the time of
    the original order as the designated beneficiaries had a legally recognized
    interest in those benefits.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    concluding that the designated beneficiaries had no interest in the pension
    benefits at the time of the original order, the motion judge likened their
    interest to that of beneficiaries under a will.  However, the interest of
    the designated beneficiary is quite different from that of a putative beneficiary
    under a will.  Once vesting occurs, the pension plan member cannot dissipate
    the pension benefits to which he or she is entitled, except in accordance
    with the terms of the pension plan and the <i>Pension Benefits Act</i>.  In
    the result, except for very limited matrimonial situations, the pension benefits
    will be intact at the time of retirement or death.  That, of course, is not
    the situation with testators who are generally free to deal with their property
    as they wish; there is no guarantee there will be any property at the time
    of death.  Another critical difference is that the scheme of distribution
    of pension benefits is established by a combination of the terms of the pension
    plan and the <i>Pension Benefits Act </i>whereas testators are generally
    free to leave their property as they wish.   </p>

    court’s decision in <i>Ontario Teacher’s Pension Plan Board v. Ontario </i>(<i>Superintendent
    of Financial Services</i>) (2004), 70 O.R. (3d) 61<i> </i>is fully consonant
    with the above expressed view of the respective interests of Mr. Lettroy
    and the designated beneficiaries at the time of the original order.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the <i>Ontario Teacher’s </i>case, the issue to be decided was whether the
    plan member had the right to assign death benefits, by way of domestic contract,
    in the absence of an express power of assignment in the governing legislation.  Mr.
    Mowbray, the plan member, had assigned his death benefits to Ms. Stairs,
    his former spouse, by means of a domestic contract entered into on marriage
    breakdown.  Mr. Mowbray later remarried.  When he died, his widow challenged
    that assignment.  This court concluded that the assignment was valid.  Paragraphs
    51 to 55 of that decision are instructive:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[51] I do not accept the Board’s argument that
    Ms.&nbsp;Stairs has no interest in the death benefits with respect to the
    pre-1987 employment.  In my view, the Divisional Court correctly found that
    pension benefits, including pre-retirement death benefits, may be transferred
    under a domestic contract without the aid of s.&nbsp;48(13) of the <i>PBA</i>.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[52] When Mr.&nbsp;Mowbray executed the separation
    agreement on August 10, 1990, he had a vested interest in the pension credits,
    then accrued.  Mr.&nbsp;Mowbray’s interest in the Plan was not confined to
    the deferred benefits to which he would become entitled upon retirement.  The
    scope of his interest included, as well, an interest in the death benefits
    that might become payable under the Plan on his death.  Death benefits, like
    other pension benefits, result from the member’s participation in the Plan.  A
    member is able to assign his or her interest in death benefits in the same
    fashion that the member is entitled to assign his or her interest in other
    pension benefits.  The fact that death benefits are conditional on the death
    of the member does not render them without value, nor does it operate to
    preclude an assignment of the member’s interest in the asset.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[53] The Board argues that ss.&nbsp;61, 62 and
    63 of the Plan specify that the recipient of the pre-retirement death benefits
    is to be the member’s surviving spouse at death.  Accordingly, Mr.&nbsp;Mowbray
    had no interest in that benefit to assign to Ms.&nbsp;Stairs.  The maxim <i>nemo
    dat quod non habet</i> operates to render the assignment to Ms.&nbsp;Stairs
    invalid.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[54] This argument ignores the fact that at the
    time of the assignment, August&nbsp;10, 1990, Mr.&nbsp;Mowbray was not married
    to Mrs.&nbsp;Mowbray.  Indeed, Mr.&nbsp;Mowbray and Ms.&nbsp;Stairs were
    not yet divorced.  The Board’s argument also ignores what I point out above – that
    it was Mr.&nbsp;Mowbray who, through his service and his contributions, had
    created the asset: his interest in the death benefits.  At the time of the
    separation agreement, that interest in the Plan belonged to Mr. Mowbray – no
    one else.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[55] Importantly, in my view, the Plan itself contemplates
    that a Plan member has an assignable interest in a benefit payable under
    the Plan.  Paragraph 86a of the Plan <span lang=EN-US>prohibits assignments
    of a “pension or benefit” except in limited circumstances, one of which is
    assignment by way of domestic contract.  The term “benefit” is not limited
    and clearly includes a pre-retirement death benefit.  The prohibition against
    assignments in para. 86a is a recognition that, absent a prohibition, pension
    benefits, including death benefits, are assignable.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Mowbray created, through his service, the asset of his interest in the death
    benefits; he was entitled to assign that interest to Ms. Stairs by way of
    domestic contract.  Just so, Mr. Lettroy created, through his service, the
    asset of his interest in the death benefits and, subject to spousal rights,
    he was entitled to give that interest to the designated beneficiaries.  The
    statutory scheme of the <i>Pension Benefits Act </i>and the terms of the
    pension plan support this view, as both<a
href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[4]</span></a> specifically
    provide that a plan member may assign pre-retirement death benefits by way
    of beneficiary designation. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have some sympathy for the Board.  Mr. Lettroy defrauded the Board of a large
    sum of money by abusing his position as a trusted employee.  Mr. Lettroy’s
    pension benefits arose as a result of his employment with the Board and,
    in some measure, the Board contributed to the creation of those pension benefits.  Nonetheless,
    the comprehensive scheme for distribution of death benefits provided by the
    pension plan and applicable legislation, coupled with s. 66(1), which specifically
    protects pension benefits from execution, precludes the appointment of an
    equitable receiver.  </p>

    all of the pension rights and benefits at the time of the original motion.  As
    the designated beneficiaries were potentially entitled to the death benefits
    at the time of the original order –
    a substantial economic benefit - they are persons who could have been affected
    by the original order and should have been given notice of the original motion.  </p>

    said, there was no need to set aside the original order because, in the circumstances

    the appointment of a receiver only to collect pension benefits being paid
    to Mr. Lettroy in the event of his retirement, whether on his normal retirement
    date or on his early retirement.  Mr. Lettroy died before becoming entitled
    to receive a pension; thus, neither possibility came to pass and neither
    can come to pass.  The terms of the original order do not provide for the
    appointment of an equitable receiver in the existing circumstances and, as
    the original order can now never have effect, it is effectively at an end.  The
    trustee of the pension plan is at liberty to pay out the death benefits in
