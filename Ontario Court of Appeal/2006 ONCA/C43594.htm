style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, Granby’s, submissions fall into three categories.  It argues that
    the cumulative effect of certain events which occurred during the trial necessitated
    a mistrial.  It asks that this court vacate the jury’s verdict and direct
    a new trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Granby
    also argues that the general damages awarded by the jury were excessive and
    beyond even the broad allowances made when reviewing jury verdicts.  It argues
    that aspects of the special damages awarded by the jury went beyond the limits
    of the evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    Granby seeks leave to appeal costs, arguing that the amount awarded by the
    trial judge does not reflect the findings he made in respect of costs and
    that the reasons fail to articulate the basis upon which the trial judge
    arrived at the amount awarded.  Counsel also argues that the trial judge
    erred in awarding a premium to trial counsel for the respondents.  </p>
  <p class=MsoHeader><b>(a)  Should the trial judge have declared a mistrial?</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not agree that any of the incidents which occurred during the trial prejudiced
    the appellants much less that the prejudice reached the point where a mistrial
    was necessary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, Granby argued that the respondents had failed to mitigate the damages
    caused by the oil spill by not taking reasonably prompt steps to clean-up
    their property or relocate permanently.  The respondents answered by asserting
    that attempts to mitigate by negotiating a quick resolution had proved impossible
    in part because of the “hardball” position taken by the appellants’ insurer.  Given
    the mitigation issue raised by Granby and the respondents’ reply to it, it
    was inevitable that the jury would come to know that the appellants were
    insured.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for Granby does not complain that the jury was fixed with the knowledge that
    Granby was insured (although that complaint was raised at trial), but complains
    that it was prejudiced by the evidence of the respondents’ son.  He testified
    that attempts to negotiate with the insurer eventually failed and that the
    insurer took the position that it was “in the business of litigation” and
    could outlast the respondents who were in their eighties.  In cross-examination,
    counsel established that Granby itself never claimed to be in the litigation
    business.  No evidence was led to suggest that the remarks attributed to
    the insurer by the respondents’ son had not been made.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    son’s evidence was relevant given the mitigation issue.  It was also unchallenged.  To
    the extent that it may have hurt Granby’s case, it cannot be described as
    unfairly prejudicial.  Having opened the door to the insurer’s response to
    attempts to negotiate a settlement by its mitigation plea, we do not think
    that Granby can claim that the jury should not have heard evidence of its
    insurer’s response to attempts to negotiate the settlement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Granby
    next argues that counsel for the respondents improperly asked a witness about
    an agreement that had been reached between Granby’s insurer and the respondents’ insurer
    with respect to certain aspects of the claim.  The trial judge told the jury
    that the question was improper and they should ignore it.  Later, he went
    a step further and told the jury that the premise of the question, that is
    that the two insurers had reached some form of settlement, was in fact wrong
    and there was no settlement.  The trial judge’s instructions cured any possible
    prejudice flowing from the question.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third complaint raised by Granby arises out of the trial judge’s decision
    to allow the respondents to produce a sample of contaminated water taken
    from their property.  The sample had been taken the day before the expert
    testified and Granby had no notice that the respondents would offer the sample
    into evidence.  The sample had a strong odour of oil.  Granby had the opportunity
    to take whatever samples of the water it wanted from the respondents’ property.  Some
    time prior to the trial, Granby had taken a sample of water from the drill
    hole from which the respondents’ sample was taken.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sample had some probative value on the question of damages in that it provided
    evidence of the extent and nature of the odour caused by the oil contamination.  The
    sample did not unfairly prejudice Granby.  Granby could have led evidence
    of its own sample taken from the same place if that sample in any way contradicted
    the evidence adduced by the respondents.  Granby was also able to respond
    to the evidence of the sample with evidence that samples taken from other
    drill holes closer on the property to the respondents’ home  had no odour.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    final complaint made on behalf of Granby arises out of counsel’s closing
    submissions on behalf of the respondents at trial.  Counsel referred to the
    eleventh hour admission of liability by Granby as partial justice for the
    respondents and indicated that his clients sought full justice from the jury.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge told the jury that the admission of liability by Granby and the
    timing of that admission were irrelevant to their task.  I see nothing inherently
    prejudicial in counsel’s submission to the jury that his clients were seeking
    full justice from them.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would add that the trial judge invited Granby to move to strike the jury
    in view of the many references to insurance which were made in the course
    of the testimony.  Granby declined to do so.  That position seems inconsistent
    with the claim on appeal that the events described above somehow poisoned
    the trial and prevented the jury from arriving at a proper verdict.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeader><b>(b)  The damage assessment</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Granby
    argues that the amount awarded by the jury for loss of value of the respondents’ home
    and the amount awarded for clean-up costs exceeded the amounts put forward
    in the testimony of the experts for the respondents.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    read the evidence differently.  The amount awarded by the jury for clean-up
    costs was within the range identified by the respondents’ expert.  Clearly,
    it was near the top of that range, but it was within the range.  The amount
    awarded by the jury for loss of value of the house as a result of the oil
    spill was slightly more than the figure provided by the respondents’ expert.  However,
    that expert testified that the property was worth “about 15 percent”  less
    as a result of the oil spill.  The amount awarded by the jury equalled about
    17 percent of the value of the home.  In our view, the difference between
    the award by the jury and the figure provided by the expert does not warrant
    appellate intervention.  An award of 17 percent of the value is not inconsistent
    with evidence that the value of the property decreased by “about 15 percent.”   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    main argument advanced on the damages part of the appeal was directed at
    the award for general non-pecuniary damages.  The jury awarded each of the
    respondents $250,000 under this head of damage.  Counsel submits that the
    amount is so excessive as to be beyond the pale of anything that could be
    regarded as reasonable.  In support of this argument, he points out that
    the respondents led no medical evidence of any difficulties experienced by
    them as a result of the oil spill.  He also submits that the other heads
    of damage ensured that the respondents would be fully compensated for all
    their economic losses.  He submits that an award in the amount of $250,000
    each for emotional distress and loss of enjoyment is well beyond amounts
    awarded in similar cases.  Counsel contends that the amount awarded can be
    explained only the basis that the jury, despite instructions to the contrary,
    decided to punish Granby for what the jury considered its improper treatment
    of the elderly respondents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    also submits that the judicially imposed cap on general damages in catastrophic
    personal injury cases should apply here and that while the award is below
    the cap, it is sufficiently close to the cap to demonstrate its unreasonableness
    given the absence of any significant injuries to the respondents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not think that this is a case where the applicability of the cap to general
    non-pecuniary damages in this kind of negligence case can be decided.  The
    amount awarded is below the cap, assuming the cap applies.  Nor did the parties
    join issue at trial on the issue of the applicability of the cap.  Instead,
    Granby took the position that as this was not a personal injury case, the
    trial judge had no statutory authority to provide a range of general damages
    for the jury.  No range was left with the jury.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was no objection to the charge to the jury as it applied to general damages.  We
    have read the charge.  In our view, it fairly and fully presents the issues
    relevant to the assessment of general damages to the jury.  The jury was
    cautioned against using general damages to punish Granby.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    was the kind of case where different juries could take very different views
    of the proper monetary measure of the pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment
    of life suffered by the respondents.  In the absence of any ongoing medical
    problems, some juries might have awarded the respondents a relatively modest
    award.  There was however, compelling evidence that the oil spill and its
    aftermath whereby the respondents lost their home, struck at the heart of
    the respondents’ entire existence in a unique and powerful way.  The jury
    could have concluded that as a result of Granby’s negligence, the respondents
    had lost permanently a home around which the rest of their life revolved.  The
    jury could have viewed this as a case in which Granby’s negligence virtually
    destroyed the respondents’ enjoyment of their life for many years and left
    the respondents at an advanced age in a position where they could never regain
    the enjoyment they had before the oil spill.  If a jury took that view, a
    very significant award of general non-pecuniary damages would follow.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    must assume that the jury took the view of the case that was reasonably open
    to them that most favoured the respondents.  Viewed from that perspective,
    we cannot say that the award, while high, was so high as to shock the conscience
    of the court.  Consequently, we cannot interfere.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeader><b>(c)  Costs</b>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Granby
    seeks leave to appeal the award of costs at trial.  While we would grant
    leave to appeal, we are not prepared to interfere with the costs order made
    by the trial judge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Granby’s
    first argument is essentially one of quantum.  It acknowledges that the trial
    judge properly ordered costs on a substantial indemnity basis after the respondents
    made an offer and he acknowledges that the trial judge properly considered
    the various relevant factors.  It submits that the amount awarded is unexplained
    and too high.  Given that the trial judge properly identified the point at
    which substantial indemnity costs were appropriate and properly referred
    to the various principles, we cannot say that the amount awarded is so high
    to demand correction by the court.  To the contrary, it seems to fall well
    within what one could reasonably expect by way of costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    also would not interfere with the trial judge’s decision to award counsel
    for the respondents a relatively modest premium.  The trial judge referred
    to the applicable principles controlling the exercise of his discretion and
    we see no error in principle in the order he made.  </p>
