    Unfortunately, the cost of construction of the new matrimonial home more

      execution. He found the value of Dr. Strobele’s pre-marriage property to

      the property, he was required to pay Ms. Strobele $160,000. This, the trial

      a fifty per cent interest in the property, based on resulting trust principles,
      after allowance was made for the fact that the property was worth substantially
      less than it cost to build. In setting the figure of $160,000, the trial

      Act</i> for equalization of net family property. He stated that the appropriate

    Strobele urges the court to take a “cost to build”
    approach to the value of the property, rather than a market value approach.
    Accordingly, instead of the market value of $1.1 million, as found by the
    trial judge, she says that $1.8 million ought to be used as the value of
    the property for purposes of calculating Dr. Strobele’s net family property.
    She contends that the “cost to build” approach is warranted in the circumstances
    of this case because the parties agreed together to spend large sums on the
    construction of the new matrimonial home, believing they would reside on
    the property for the remainder of their lives. She says it is unfair to allow
    Dr. Strobele to stay on the property and enjoy the benefit of the new matrimonial
    home without compensating her for the money that she contributed to its construction
    and that using a “cost to build” approach assists in resolving that unfairness. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge rejected this argument, saying at pages 36 to 37 of the reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[W]e cannot
    embark on a process of attributing subjective value to property in matrimonial
    disputes and the reason for that is this: it would arise in every case in
    respect to a broad range of assets, everything ranging from sentimental assets
    of no market value whatsoever but of great personal sentimental value to
    very large ticket items such as houses and cottages and the like. It is a
    measure that will conflate the matrimonial property process and ultimately
    lead to results that cannot be borne by the parties because they will be
    asked to pay amounts of money they cannot afford. It will also lead to distortions
    in the allocation of property because, if the market value is considerably
    less than the sentimental value, it will encourage people to force sales
    of the property in order to buy the property in a roundabout fashion. There
    are all sorts of reasons for not adopting it. I would not exclude the prospect
    of adopting that kind of an analysis for a unique object in a unique set
    of circumstances, but I cannot accept it as general proposition for valuation
    in matrimonial cases.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the trial judge’s determination and reasoning on this issue. In
    my view, he made no error in finding the value of the property to be $1.1
    million as at the date of separation. The trial judge was entitled to accept
    the evidence of Mr. Bruce Rae, the expert called by Ms. Strobele, as to the
    market value of the property at the date of separation. In my view, he was
    correct in holding that the market value of the property, rather than the
    “cost to build”, was the proper approach to follow when valuing the property.
    Although the value of the property to the parties is doubtless in excess
    of that which a third party would pay in an open market, for the reasons
    given by the trial judge, the property was properly assigned its fair market
    value.        </p>

    their respective net family properties, pursuant to the <i>Family Law Act</i>,
    if the property were sold. However, if Dr. Strobele chose to remain in the
    property, he was to pay Ms. Strobele $160,000. The trial judge explicitly
    acknowledged that he arrived at that figure by not applying the equalization
    provisions in the <i>Family Law Act</i>.</p>

    my view, the trial judge erred in failing to follow the procedure prescribed
    by the <i>Family Law Act</i>. He had no authority to determine ownership
    of the new matrimonial home as a discrete matter, rather than as part of
    calculating each party’s net family property. Ms. Strobele’s entitlement
    is to an equalization of the parties’ net family property in accordance with
    Part 1 of the <i>Family Law Act</i>. That is so whether Dr. Strobele remains
    in the property or it is sold. See <i>Hamilton v. Hamilton</i>, [1996] O.
    J. No. 2634 at paras. 23 – 26 (C.A.).  </p>

    on a value of the property of $1.1 million, Dr. Strobele’s net family property
    statement reveals that, after allowing for the value of property owned on
    the date of marriage as per the finding of the trial judge, his debts exceed
    his assets. His net family property is, accordingly, deemed to be zero and
    he owes Ms. Strobele no equalization payment.   </p>

    and in any event, in my view, the trial judge erred in quantifying Ms. Strobele’s
    interest in the property at fifty per cent. In <i>Hamilton, supra</i>, at
    para. 34, this court held that the extent of the beneficial interest is “proportionate
    to the financial contribution made to acquire the property”. The trial judge
    found that Ms. Strobele contributed $240,000 towards the cost of construction
    of the new matrimonial home. He found that the cost of construction was $1.8
    million. Based on those findings, Ms. Strobele is entitled to a 13% interest
    in the property. However, it must be noted that Ms. Strobele’s 13% interest
    is in the full asset, that is, in both the value of the property and the
    debts associated with it. As the debts exceed the value of the property,
    her 13% interest has a negative value.     <b><u></u></b></p>

    see no need to deal with the speculation that the trial judge may have been
    intending to act pursuant to s. 5(6) of the <i>Family Law Act</i> when he
    granted Ms. Strobele a fifty per cent interest in the property. No claim
    was made under that section and the trial judge did not purport to act pursuant
    to it. Further, he did not make the findings necessary to empower him to
    make such an award. <b><u></u></b></p>

    For the reasons already given, in my view, treating her claim in this manner
    is not a permissible approach to deciding the parties’
    respective entitlements. The proper approach to determining each party’s
    entitlement is by means of equalization of net family property values in

    as a result of her contributions towards the construction of the new matrimonial
    home. Moreover, as will be evident on reading the following analysis, Ms.
    Strobele has suffered no deprivation. </p>

    found by the trial judge, Dr. Strobele entered the marriage with property
    having a net value of $430,000. At the end of the marriage, after allowance
    is made for his pre-marriage property, his debts exceed his assets. Consequently,
    despite Ms. Strobele’s contributions, it cannot be said that Dr. Strobele
    has been enriched. On the contrary, he is worse off financially than he was
    when he entered the marriage. </p>

    Strobele, on the other hand, is better off financially since the marriage.
    As found by the trial judge, Ms. Strobele entered the marriage with property
    having a net value of $16,000. Based on the trial judge’s findings, which
    include that Ms. Strobele has a pension valued at $49,000 (after allowing
    for taxes) and RRSPs valued at $33,489, again after allowing for taxes, Ms
    Strobele’s net family property is greater than $16,000.</p>

    Strobele then argues that Dr. Strobele has been enriched to the extent of
    $240,000 because the debt against the property would be that much greater,
    absent her contributions. Even on that assumption, Dr. Strobele has still
    not been enriched. This argument ignores the fact that the parties jointly
    incurred the debts in relation to the new matrimonial home and are jointly
    liable for them. If the debts were greater, both would share in the consequences
    of an even worse investment made during their marriage. That does not amount
    to an enrichment on Dr. Strobele’s part. His net family property value would
    be a larger negative number but, for equalization purposes, it would still
    be presumed to be zero.       </p>
