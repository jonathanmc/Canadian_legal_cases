style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sarah Bahris, a resident of British Columbia, is one of
    Jehovah’s Witnesses.  She objects on
    religious grounds to having blood transfusions.  In December 2004, when she was fourteen years of age, Sarah was
    diagnosed with bone cancer.  She has now
    been successfully treated and is cancer-free.  However, in the course of her treatment in British Columbia, Sarah’s
    physicians became convinced that she might need a blood transfusion to survive
    and that the need for the transfusion might arise suddenly.  Courts in British Columbia have made orders
    at the request of The Director of Child, Family and Community Service for the
    Province of British Columbia (the respondent) that gave Sarah’s physicians the
    right to transfuse her, without her consent and without the consent of her
    parents.  On April 11, 2005, Boyd J. of
    the Supreme Court of British Columbia dismissed Sarah’s appeal from the order
    permitting the transfusion without her consent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later in April, against the advice of her physician that she
    should remain in Vancouver, Sarah and her parents (the appellants) came to
    Ontario.  The reason for the attendance
    in Toronto is a matter of dispute.  The
    appellants claim that they came to Toronto to seek a second opinion concerning
    treatment and, specifically, whether treatment options were available that did
    not involve transfusions.  The
    respondent claims that the appellants came to Ontario to avoid the British
    Columbia court orders and to avail themselves of Ontario’s consent to treatment
    regime.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April 27, 2005, Boyd J. made an <i>ex parte</i> order granting custody of Sarah to the Director.  The Director’s counsel then attended in
    Toronto and obtained an <i>ex parte</i> order from Mesbur J. recognizing and enforcing Boyd J.’s order.  This order was made Friday afternoon, April
    29, 2005.  On the evening of April 30,
    2005, the appellants attended before Jarvis J. to set aside Mesbur J.’s
    order.  Jarvis J. refused to set aside
    the order but adjourned the motion to Tuesday, May 3, to permit the appellants
    to adduce evidence.  On May 3, Paisley
    J. confirmed Mesbur J.’s order.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In accordance with the Ontario orders, Sarah returned to
    British Columbia.  She and her parents
    then reached an agreement with the Director allowing her to complete her
    treatment at a hospital in New York.  That hospital has considerable experience in treating members of
    Jehovah’s Witnesses without transfusions.  As a result of this agreement, the order of Boyd J. was vacated and the
    appellants gave up their right to appeal her order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite the fact that Boyd J.’s order has been vacated, the
    appellants appeal the orders of Mesbur J. and Paisley J.  The Director argues that the appeal is moot
    and that this court should not exercise its discretion to hear the appeal.  The court reserved its decision on the
    mootness argument and heard argument on the appeal.  In my view, the appeal is moot but this is an appropriate case to
    exercise our discretion to determine some, but not all, of the issues raised on
    the appeal.  For the following reasons,
    I would allow the appeal and set aside the orders of Mesbur J. and Paisley J.</p>

    the mootness argument and the other issues raised by the appeal.  However, below is a chronology of the
    events.  Where necessary, I will
    elaborate on some of those events.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>December 2004            Sarah
    diagnosed with bone cancer; her physician informs her that transfusion may be
    necessary in course of treatment; Sarah and parents inform physician of
    objection to transfusion.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>February 15, 2005            Meeting
    with Sarah, her mother, the Director’s counsel and hospital staff to inform
    Sarah and mother that Director may bring emergency application to permit
    transfusion.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>March 7 – 15, 2005            Events
    during treatment cause physicians to ask Director to obtain authorization to
    transfuse.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>March 16, 2005            Director
    brings emergency application under s. 29 of <i>Child,
    Family and Community Service Act</i>, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 46.  Section 29 permits Director to apply for an
    order authorizing health care where a child or parent of a child refused to
    give consent to health care and the health care is necessary to preserve the
    child’s life.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>March 18, 2005            Meyers
    Prov. Ct. J. makes order authorizing physician to administer blood or blood
    products. Appellants prohibited from obstructing transfusion.  Sarah found to have capacity to refuse
    treatment but her decision overridden in her best interests.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>March 24, 2005            Meyers
    Prov. Ct. J. dismisses application to set aside his order.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>April 7 – 8, 2005            Hearing
    before Boyd J. of appeal from order of Meyers Prov. Ct. J.  Boyd J. finds that appellants were accorded
    procedural fairness, that order properly made and that no infringement of
    Sarah’s rights under s. 2(a), 7 and 15 of <i>Charter
    of Rights and Freedoms</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>April 21, 2005            Sarah
    and mother attend for appointment at hospital.  Treating physician agrees to speak to physician in Ottawa about
    transfusion alternatives.  Sarah’s
    request to travel to Vernon (her home) for weekend denied for medical reasons.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>April 25, 2005            Sarah
    fails to attend scheduled medical appointment.  British Columbia physician advised by physician at Toronto Hospital for
    Sick Children that Sarah and parents had attended without appointment to
    request transfer of care.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>April 27, 2005            Director
    brings <i>ex parte</i> application before
    Boyd J.  Order granted <i>inter alia</i> giving Director interim
    custody and prohibiting removal of Sarah from British Columbia.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>April 29, 2005            Mesbur
    J. grants <i>ex parte</i> application
    recognizing and directing enforcement of April 27 order under s. 41 of the <i>Children’s Law Reform Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. C.12.  Because Mesbur J. believes
    that Sarah’s whereabouts are being withheld, she also makes an order under
    s.&nbsp;36 allowing for child’s apprehension by the police.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>April 30, 2005            Jarvis
    J. adjourns motion by appellants to stay or set aside April 29, 2005 orders on
    condition that Sarah and parents appear in court on May 3.  In his endorsement, Jarvis J. provides in
    part as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>                                                <span style='font-size:12.0pt'>I
    recognize the importance and the dire consequences of orders being made without
    notice.  In my view, the family ought to
    have the opportunity to call evidence and make representations.  To achieve this, it is my order that this
    motion be adjourned to May 3/05 at 10:00 a.m. to afford the family and the
    respondents [the opportunity] to present further materials and make more
    orderly submissions.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>May 1, 2005            Parties
    reach agreement delaying police enforcement on condition appellants appear in
    court on May 3.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>May 2, 2005            Appellants
    serve notices of motion to adduce <i>viva
    voce</i> evidence, set aside orders of Mesbur J. and permit Sarah to travel to
    New York State to begin treatment.  Appellants also serve Notice of Constitutional Question questioning
    constitutional validity of the April 29 order.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>May 3, 2005            Parties
    attend before Paisley J.  Police are
    also in attendance.  [Sarah’s next round
    of chemotherapy in B.C. scheduled to begin this day.]  Paisley J. finds that Mesbur J. had jurisdiction to make order;
    refuses to hear <i>viva voce</i> evidence
    and confirms April 29 order.  Sarah
    returns to B.C. [Parties dispute degree of involvement of police in enforcing
    order.  Sarah claims she was
    “arrested”.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>May 9, 2005            Appellants
    serve notice of appeal to B.C.C.A. from order of Boyd J.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>May 17, 2005            Appellants
    abandon appeal. Gerow J. makes consent order vacating April 27, 2005 order of
    Boyd J. and varying order of Meyers Prov. Ct. J.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>June 1, 2005            Appeal
    to this court from orders of Mesbur J. and Paisley J.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Mootness</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The orders the appellants seek to set aside in this appeal
    enforced an order of the British Columbia Supreme Court.  The appeal to the British Columbia Court of
    Appeal from that order was abandoned and the order itself has been
    vacated.  Further, Sarah is now
    cancer-free and there is no suggestion that there is any need for such an order
    at this time.  As a consequence, in my
    view, there is no longer any live controversy between the parties as regards
    the Ontario orders and the appeal from those orders is now moot.  The Ontario orders were made in aid of a
    British Columbia order that has been vacated.  Moreover, the parties have settled all of the issues between themselves
    that gave rise to the British Columbia order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants submit that the appeal is not moot because they
    are seeking a declaration under s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>. The
    theory, as I understand it, is that the Ontario courts did not accord the
    appellate fundamental justice because of procedural errors.  However, this theory misconceives the nature
    of the relief this court would grant.  If the orders of the Ontario courts violated the appellants’ procedural rights, this court can set
    aside those orders, but it would not ordinarily grant declarations that those
    orders violated their rights.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants also seek a declaration concerning Sarah’s
    right to freedom of religion under s. 2(a) of the <i>Charter </i>as it relates
    to her ability to consent to treatment and that a capable person in Ontario of
    any age may decide his or her medical treatment.  This declaration was not sought in the courts below.  There is no live controversy between the
    appellants and the respondent in this litigation concerning such a
    declaration.  The Director has no
    interest in the rights of Ontario residents.  Sarah is not a resident of Ontario and is not receiving any treatment in
    Ontario for which her consent is required.  As Doherty J.A. said in <i>Tamil
    Co-operative Homes Inc. v. Arulappah</i> (2000), 49 O.R. (3d) 566 (C.A.) at para.
    16:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The parties
    remain adversarial only in the sense that they take different positions on the
    legal issues raised before the courts below.  They are aptly described as opposing debaters taking affirmative and
    negative positions on legal propositions and not as litigants opposed in
    interest in an ongoing legal controversy.  The appeal is moot.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, in my view, this is an appropriate case for this
    court to depart from its usual practice and exercise its discretion to
    determine some of the issues raised in the appeal.  The three criteria applied in deciding whether to exercise the
    discretion are whether there still exists an adversarial relationship, concern
    for conserving judicial resources and sensitivity to the court’s proper
    law-making function.  As regards this
    last factor, it is important to bear in mind what was said in <i>Borowski v. Canada (Attorney General)</i>,
    [1989] 1 S.C.R. 342 at p. 362, “Pronouncing judgments in the absence of a
    dispute affecting the rights of the parties may be viewed as intruding into the
    role of the legislative branch.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying these criteria I am of the view that the court should
    not consider the broad issues the appellants seek to litigate concerning the
    Ontario consent to treatment regime and the alleged infringements of Sarah’s s.
    2(a) right.  On the consent to treatment
    issues, there is no adversarial relationship.  The Director has no interest in this aspect of the case, which concerns
    a statutory regime wholly different from the regime in which the Director operates
    in British Columbia.  The parties that
    might be interested in this issue such as the Attorney General for Ontario and
    the Children’s Aid Society are not present.  The concern for judicial resources also militates against hearing these
    issues.  The court’s decision will have
    no practical effect on the rights of the parties.  There is no indication that these issues are of a recurring
    nature but of brief duration justifying the use of judicial resources.  With respect to the alleged infringement of
    s. 2(a), that issue was fully litigated before Boyd J. in British Columbia. The
    appellants gave up their right to appeal Boyd J.’s order. They should not be
    allowed to, in effect, mount a collateral attack on the British Columbia order
    on grounds never raised before the Ontario courts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, it is not in the public interest to resolve those
    issues on this record.  Because of the
    way in which the case made its way to this court there is not a full
    evidentiary record relating either to Sarah’s particular circumstances or the
    operation of the Ontario consent to treatment regime.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I take a different view, however, with respect to the
    procedural and related issues raised by this case.  The paramount consideration on this aspect of the case is the
    concern for judicial resources.  The
    case raises issues of a recurring nature but brief duration.  The Ontario judges were presented with
    circumstances that required immediate attention.  Within hours of Paisley J.’s order, Sarah was on an airplane back
    to British Columbia.  In circumstances
    such as these the dispute will always have disappeared before it can be
    ultimately resolved.  See <i>Borowski</i> at p. 361: “In my view,
    expending judicial resources is warranted in this case given the importance of
    the issues and the fact that this type of case is evasive of review (<i>New
    Brunswick (Minister of Health and Community Services) v. G(J.)</i>, [1999] 3
    S.C.R. 46 at para. 45)”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For this court to take jurisdiction in this case is consistent
    with the court’s role as the adjudicative branch.  The issues presented on this aspect of the case concern the
    procedure to be adopted by the courts.  There is no intrusion into the legislative sphere.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, I am not concerned by the absence of a true
    adversarial relationship.  The court has
    been provided with a full record, including fresh evidence, from both sides
    about the events leading up to the orders made by the Ontario judges.  It is evident that the parties, including
    the Director, are still intensely interested in this aspect of the litigation.  It is not beyond the realm of possibility
    that the Director will be faced with a similar situation and it is in the
    Director’s interest as much as the appellants’ that the correct procedure be

    under s. 41(1) of the <i>Children’s Law
    Reform Act</i>.  Section 41(1) provides
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Upon application
    by any person in whose favour an order for the custody of or access to a child
    has been made by an extra-provincial tribunal, a court shall recognize the
    order unless the court is satisfied,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>(a) that the respondent was not given reasonable notice of the commencement
    of the proceeding in which the order was made;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    extra-provincial tribunal before the order was made;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    the extra-provincial tribunal to have regard for the best interests of the
    child;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>(d) that the order of the extra-provincial tribunal is contrary to public
    policy in Ontario; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    would not have jurisdiction if it were a court in Ontario.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Up to April 27, 2005, the orders made by the British Columbia
    courts in this proceeding were made under s. 29 of the <i>Child, Family and Community Service Act</i> (B.C.).  Those orders authorized health care without
    the consent of Sarah or her parents.  In
    my view, they were not custody orders within the meaning of s. 41(1).  As the Attorney General of British Columbia
    put it his memorandum of argument on the appeal in early April 2005 before Boyd
    J., the s. 29 order merely removes “an impediment to treatment of the child and
    provision of health care in circumstances contemplated by that section.  That is, the treating physician is no longer
    open to an action and liability for damages for battery for providing health care
    treatment without consent”.</p>

line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Director did not refer us to any authority suggesting that
    an order made under s. 29 of the <i>Child, Family and Community Service Act</i> was a custody order. Section 29 permits a court to order the parent to do
    certain things, including delivering the child to the place where the
    healthcare is provided. The order may also include any other terms that the
    court considers necessary. The order made by Meyers Prov. Ct. J. prohibited the
    parents and Sarah from obstructing provision of blood to Sarah but did not
    interfere with the parents’ custody or access to the child. Other provisions of
    the <i>Act</i> deal with care and custody of a child, for example, ss. 32 and
    41 to 50.</p>

line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the only custody order was the one made by Boyd J.
    on April 27, 2005.  Paragraph 4 of that
    order reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.5pt;'>The Director of
    Child, Family and Community Service for the Province of British </span><span

    of interest is paragraph 6 of that order:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span

    supervised access to the Child provided such access does not interfere with or

line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paisley J. reasoned that s. 41(1)(b) had no application
    because the earlier orders made by the British Columbia courts were custody or
    access orders and the April 27<sup> </sup>order “was to enforce the custodial
    aspect of the orders already made”.  Even if I am wrong, and the earlier s. 29 orders could be construed as
    custody orders, because they dealt with an attribute of custody, namely,
    consent to treatment, s. 41(1) applies only if, <i>inter alia</i>, the appellants were given an opportunity to be heard by
    the British Columbia court before “the order” was made.  In my view “the order” referred to in para.
    (b) is the custody order for which the Director sought enforcement, namely the
    April 27 <i>ex parte</i> order.  The April 27 order did not simply enforce
    the earlier orders; it gave the Director sole interim custody of Sarah, took
    Sarah out of the custody of her parents and in paragraph 6 gave them only
    supervised access to Sarah.  The April
    27 order represented a profound change in the custody and access arrangements
    respecting Sarah.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I did not understand the respondent to dispute the fact that
    the appellants were not given an opportunity to be heard before the April 27<sup> </sup>order was made.  In any event, I
    am satisfied that they were not given that opportunity.  While Boyd J. undoubtedly had the entire file
    before her and was intimately familiar with the case, she had only the
    Director’s version of why Sarah and her parents had come to Toronto.  As V. Mackinnon&nbsp;J. said in <i>Ndegwa v.
    Ndegwa</i> (2001), 20 R.F.L. (5<sup>th</sup>) 118 (Ont. Sup. Ct. J.) at para.
    15 “‘Being heard’ [within the meaning of s. 41(1)(b)] entails knowing the case
    to be met and having the opportunity to address the factual and legal issues in
    the case.”  Sarah and her parents did
    not have that opportunity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, on this basis alone, the orders of the Ontario
    courts should be set aside. It was not argued that the judges had a discretion
    to recognize the orders even if one of the exceptions in s. 41(1)(b) applied. I
    should not be taken as deciding that such a discretion does not exist.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Director argued that notice of the s. 29 application was
    notice of the commencement of the proceeding for the purpose of s. 41(1)(a).
    Given my conclusion respecting s. 41(1)(b), I need not decide whether the
    condition in s. 41(1)(a) was met, i.e., that the appellants were given
    reasonable notice of “the commencement of the proceeding in which the order was
    made because they had been given notice of the s. 29 application.”</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Should
    Paisley J. have heard <i>viva voce</i> evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paisley J. ruled that he would deal with what he termed “the
    jurisdictional issue” before hearing any of the evidence the appellants wished
    to place before him.  This approach
    would be appropriate in two respects.  First, if Mesbur J. had no jurisdiction to make the <i>ex parte </i>order, it could be set aside without need to hear any
    additional evidence the appellants proposed to call on that issue.  As I understand it, the jurisdiction issue
    was whether any of the exceptions in s. 41(1), such as para. (b), applied.  Second, Paisley J. was only required to hear
    evidence that was relevant to the issues before him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, in my view, it was not open to Paisley J. to
    determine the jurisdiction issue against the appellants without hearing
    relevant evidence the parties sought to put before him.  In doing so, he deprived the appellants of
    the fair <i>inter partes</i> hearing to
    which they were entitled.  The
    appellants sought to introduce <i>viva voce</i> evidence that would show the purpose for Sarah’s attendance in Toronto and, in
    particular, that they were not forum shopping, that there was no medical
    emergency requiring an <i>ex parte</i> hearing before Mesbur J., that alternative treatment without blood transfusion
    was available in New York and that the Director was aware of the alternative
    treatment.  This evidence was at least relevant
    to the public policy issue under s. 41(1)(d) and to s. 43, which provides as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Upon
    application, a court by order may supersede an extra-provincial order in
    respect of custody of or access to a child if the court is satisfied that the
    child would, on the balance of probability, suffer serious harm if,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>(a) the child remains in the custody of the person legally entitled to
    custody of the child;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>(b) the child is returned to the custody of the person entitled to
    custody of the child; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not say that either the public policy issue or the s. 43
    issues would have succeeded, but the evidence that the appellants proposed to
    introduce was relevant to them.  For
    example, although as a matter of constitutional law, the courts of one province
    are required to give full faith and credit to the orders of the courts of other
    provinces, it would seem to be open to a party to argue that the order of the
    extra-provincial court is contrary to public policy.  See <i>Morguard Investments
    Ltd. v. De Savoye</i>, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1077 at 1110.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent argues that the order of Jarvis J. makes it
    clear that the appellants were only entitled to rely upon affidavit evidence
    and that Paisley J. considered the affidavits that the appellants placed before
    him.  I have set out the important part
    of the order of Jarvis J. above but repeat it here for convenience.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I recognize the importance and the dire
    consequences of orders being made without notice.  In my view, the family ought to have the opportunity to call
    evidence and make representations.  To
    achieve this, it is my order that this motion be adjourned to May 3/05 at 10:00
    a.m. to afford the family and the respondents [the opportunity] to present
    further materials and make more orderly submissions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties rely upon different parts of the order.  The appellants note the phrase “opportunity
    to call evidence”, while the respondent refers to the phrase “present further
    materials”.  In my view, the most that
    can be said in favour of the respondent’s position is that the reasons are
    ambiguous.  In those circumstances, to
    avoid any appearance of unfairness, it would have been proper for Paisley J. to
    hear the oral evidence the appellants wished to adduce, particularly given the
    tight time constraints under which the appellants were operating.  But, more to the point, in my view, he did
    not refuse to hear the evidence because of the form in which it was presented
    but because of the view he formed as to jurisdiction.  In my view, the order of Jarvis J. is no answer to the
    appellants’ submission that they were deprived of a fair hearing.  Accordingly, on this basis as well, I would
    set aside the order of Paisley J.</p>

line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before concluding, I wish to note one further issue that, it
    seems to me, arises from this case.  Even if the respondent was not entitled to enforce the British Columbia
    order, it is possible that he could have applied or sought the intervention of
    the Ontario Children’s Aid Society under Part III of the <i>Child and Family
    Services Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.11 on the basis that Sarah was a child in
    need of protection.  I do not say that
    such an application would succeed or was even feasible or that an Ontario court
    would exercise jurisdiction in such a case.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a>  We did not hear argument on those
    issues.  We also did not hear argument
    on the difficult question that would follow concerning the relationship between
    s. 62 of that Act [allowing the Society to consent to medical treatment of a
    Society ward] and the <i>Health Care Consent Act, 1996</i>, S.O. 1996, c. 2,
    Sched. A.</p>
