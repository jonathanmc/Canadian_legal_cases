  <h4><span lang=EN-US>JURIANSZ J.A.:</span></h4>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Attorney General of Ontario seeks to appeal the order of Glithero J. dated
    May 3, 2005, that allowed the respondent’s summary conviction appeal and
    quashed his conviction on September 9, 2004, for operating a motor vehicle
    with a blood alcohol concentration “over 80”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Early
    in the morning of October 10, 2003, the respondent was involved in a motor
    vehicle collision when the car he was operating left the roadway and struck
    a light standard.  The trial judge found that the accident occurred shortly
    before 1:38 a.m. when a witness telephoned 911 to report the accident.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the 911 call, the caller did not mention that alcohol might have been involved.  At
    2:37 a.m. a police officer on duty in a different patrol area noticed that
    the call was still outstanding and volunteered to investigate.  He arrived
    on the scene at 2:40 a.m.  He arrested the respondent for impaired driving
    at 2:47 a.m. and took him to the detachment, arriving there at 2:58 a.m.  At
    3:10 a.m. a qualified technician took breath samples with readings of 180
    and 190 mg of alcohol in100 ml of blood, respectively.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted, the trial judge convicted the respondent on the
    “over 80” charge.  The summary conviction appeal judge set aside this conviction
    and entered an acquittal. </p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>Trial Decision</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial the respondent submitted that the prosecution had failed to prove that
    the breath samples were taken as soon as practicable after the accident as
    required by s.&nbsp;258(1)(<i>c</i>)(ii), and therefore, the Crown could
    not rely on the breathalyzer results.  The trial judge found that the explanation
    for the delay of approximately one hour and forty to fifty minutes between
    the accident and the taking of the first sample was explained by the fact
    that the police did not arrive and commence their investigation until approximately
    one hour and ten minutes after the accident.  He said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It is my opinion
    that the Crown should not be required to go behind the facts indicating when
    the investigation began, in order to provide a history of the activity at
    the precinct or the police station which might cover the period of time in
    question.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also rejected evidence proffered by the respondent to rebut the
    presumption of accuracy of the breathalyzer results and found him guilty
    of driving “over 80”.  He dismissed the impaired driving charge.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>Decision of the Summary Conviction Appeal
    Judge</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal judge held that the trial judge erred in law by considering only whether
    the prosecution had shown that the breath samples were taken as soon as practicable
    after the police arrived on the scene, rather than as soon as practicable
    after the time of the offence as required by s. 258(1)(<i>c</i>)(2).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal judge found there was insufficient evidence to explain the delay prior
    to the police officer’s arrival at the scene of the accident.  In doing so,
    he relied on this court’s decision in <i>R. v. Letford</i> (2000), 150 C.C.C.
    (3d) 225 for the proposition, which he paraphrased as follows: “in appropriate
    circumstances the [Court] must demonstrate, ‘The way the police are organized
    and why’, as part of the explanation for any passage of time within which
    arguably the breath tests could have been taken more promptly.”  He said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>If, as, [was] held by the Court of Appeal in <i>Letford</i>,
    the real reason behind the delay lies in police unavailability then the Crown <u>has
    to</u> show the way in which the police are organized and why they are organized
    that way as part of an obligation to explain why the delay is reasonable.
    [Underlining added]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying
    this proposition, the appeal judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>In my respectful analysis the statement by the responding officer,
    that we were busy that night, is not sufficient.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In my respectful
    view I am not prepared, allowed or permitted in the circumstances of this
    case to draw a legal inference that the police had a reasonable explanation
    available to them for the admittedly sufficient period of time that elapsed
    so as to require some explanation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the Crown had not called evidence of the way the police were organized he
    found that the prosecution had failed to prove that the breath samples had
    been taken as soon as was practicable. The appeal judge found that therefore
    the Crown could not rely on the presumption of their accuracy, allowed the
    appeal, and quashed the conviction.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>Analysis</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the appeal judge that the trial judge applied the incorrect legal
    standard by considering only the time between the officer’s arrival on the
    scene and the taking of the breath samples.  However, with respect, I am
    of the view the principle stated in<i> Letford </i>does not apply to this
    case.  The misapplication of <i>Letford</i> raises a question of law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Letford</i>, the
    taking of the breath samples was delayed because, at the time of the accused’s
    arrest, there was no qualified breathalyzer technician on duty at the arresting
    officer’s OPP detachment.  It was necessary to request a breathalyzer technician
    to attend from another detachment. The trial judge acquitted the accused
    on the charge of “over 80” because he considered himself bound by the decision
    in <i>R. v. Langlois</i> (1999), 40 W.C.B. (2d) 502, which he understood
    as requiring the Crown to have a breathalyzer available at every detachment
    at all times or otherwise organize themselves to have breath samples taken
    as soon as possible.  Consequently, he found the breath samples had not been
    taken as soon as practicable and acquitted the accused.  The summary conviction
    appeal judge dismissed the Crown’s appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown’s appeal in <i>Letford</i> to this court was allowed.  Goudge J.A.
    observed that, to meet the soon as practicable requirement, the police did
    not have to organize themselves to have a breathalyzer technician available
    at every detachment at all times or to otherwise organize themselves to have
    breath samples taken as soon as possible.  He stated at para. 17 that the
    task of the trial judge was “to assess all the circumstances of this case
    to determine if the breath samples were taken as soon as practicable, that
    is, within a reasonably prompt time, under the circumstances.”  Goudge J.A.
    went on to comment at para. 19: “Where, as here, the way in which the police
    organized their staff and equipment appears relevant to the time taken until
    the first breathalyzer test, it and any reason offered for it are matters
    for the court to consider in determining” whether the samples were taken
    as soon as practicable.  He ordered a new trial so that a proper assessment
    could be performed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is worth noting that the delay in <i>Letford</i> occurred after the driver
    had been detained and the breath demand had already been made.  As I understand
    it, the way the police were organized in <i>Letford</i> appeared relevant
    because they were not prepared to receive and take breath samples promptly
    after becoming possessed of grounds sufficient to make a demand.  The facts
    of this case are different from those in <i>Letford</i>.  Here, the delay
    that requires explanation occurred before the police had the grounds to demand
    a breath sample.  There is no suggestion in this case that the police were
    not adequately organized to receive and take breath samples promptly.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
    importantly, the basic question for the court in this case, as it was in <i>Letford</i>,
    is whether, in all the circumstances, the Crown has demonstrated that the
    breath samples were taken as soon as practicable.  <i>Letford</i> stands
    for the proposition that the Crown may meet the burden by calling evidence
    of police organization but need not do so if other evidence is sufficient.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the arresting officer’s testimony that it was a busy night and that
    other calls were waiting coupled with the fact that there had been no suggestion
    in the initial call that alcohol might have been involved in the accident
    was capable of supporting a finding that the delayed police arrival was reasonable
    in the circumstances.  It was unnecessary for the Crown to call a senior
    officer from the detachment or the dispatcher on duty to explain how the
    police were deployed to the various patrol areas or to provide details about
    what other calls occupied the police that night.  In my respectful view,
    the other possible inferences suggested by the appeal judge, for example
    that there might have been fourteen murders in town that night, were speculative.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    comments of Rosenberg J.A. that Parliament enacted ss. 254 and 258 to expedite
    trials should be kept in mind when applying these sections. In <i>R. v. Vanderbruggen</i> (2006),
    206 C.C.C. (3d) 489 (Ont. C.A.) he said at para. 16:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>To conclude,
    these provisions, which are designed to expedite trials and aid in proof
    of the suspect’s blood alcohol level, should not be interpreted so as to
    require an exact accounting of every moment in the chronology.  We are now
    far removed from the days when the breathalyzer was first introduced into
    Canada and there may have been some suspicion and scepticism about its accuracy
    and value and about the science underlying the presumption of identity.  <u>These
    provisions must be interpreted reasonably in a manner that is consistent
    with Parliament’s purpose in facilitating the use of this reliable evidence</u> [emphasis
    added].<u></u></p>
  <h3 align=left style='
text-align:left'>Conclusion</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, I would grant leave to appeal, allow the Crown’s appeal and
    order a new trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    note that the decisions of both courts below were rendered before the Supreme
    Court of Canada released its judgment in <i>R. v. Boucher</i> (2005), 202
    C.C.C. (3d) 34.  The Crown recognizes that objection could be taken to the
    trial judge having considered the breath test results in rejecting the evidence
    to the contrary proffered by the respondent.  For this reason as well, I
    would order a new trial.</p>
