style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal concerns the jurisdiction of the Normal Farm Practices Protection
    Board under the <i>Farming and Food Production Protection Act, 1998</i>,
    S.O. 1998, c.&nbsp;1 (the <i>FFPPA</i>) to grant relief from the application
    of a zoning by-law.  Pursuant to subsection 6(3) and 6(6) of the <i>FFPPA</i>,
    the Board is empowered to determine whether an agricultural operation or
    proposed operation that is directly affected by a municipal by-law is a normal
    farm practice<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a>. If so, then, pursuant to s. 6(1) of
    the Act:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>No municipal by-law applies to restrict a normal
    farm practice carried on as part of an agricultural operation</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    central issue on this appeal is whether, as the Divisional Court held, the
    definition of the term “municipal by-law” in s. 6(1) of the FFPPA<i> </i>is
    narrower than the commonly understood meaning of the term so as to exclude
    a zoning by-law or whether, as the Board implicitly held, “municipal by-law” includes
    a zoning by-law.  If the Divisional Court’s interpretation is correct, the
    Board has no jurisdiction to determine whether a zoning by-law restricts
    a normal farm practice.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I am of the opinion that the Divisional Court erred
    in law in adopting an interpretation of the words
    “municipal by-law” that excluded a zoning by-law.  Thus, the Board had jurisdiction
    to determine whether the zoning-by-law in issue here restricted a normal
    farm practice.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
    conclusion requires me to go on and review the decision of the Board.  I
    am of the opinion that the Board’s decision should be reviewed on a standard
    of reasonableness. Pursuant to section 6(15) of the FFPPA, one of the four
    factors the Board is required to consider in determining whether a practice
    is a normal farm practice is whether the by-law reflects a provincial interest
    as set out in a policy statement. The Board held that its decision did not
    contradict the provincial policy statements issued under Section 3 of the
    Planning Act. The provincial policy statements require that new or expanding
    livestock facilities comply with the minimum distances separation formulae.
    Inasmuch as the Board’s decision cut the required minimum distance separating
    Hill’s proposed operation from the Stanley Complex in half, the Board’s conclusion
    that its decision was in compliance with the provincial policy statements
    is simply not tenable and is unreasonable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
    importantly, s.9 of the <i>FFPPA</i>, requires that,”
    …the Board’s decisions under this Act must be consistent with [the Minister
    of Agriculture’s] directives, guidelines or policy statements.”  The exercise
    of the Board’s power was therefore limited by s.&nbsp;9.  All that By-law
    22 -1985 of the Township of Stanley did was enact the Minimum Distance Separation
    (MDSII) guidelines of the Ministry of Agriculture for the siting of livestock
    facilities from other uses.  The Board’s decision that Hill need not comply
    with the minimum distance specified in the by-law for siting his barns is
    not consistent with the MDSII guidelines.  The Board’s decision is therefore
    unreasonable; it surpasses the limitation imposed by s.&nbsp;9 and therefore
    cannot stand.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a result, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hill
    owns and operates a pig farm located within the geographic Township of Stanley,
    Huron County.  The former Township of Stanley is now part of the amalgamated
    Municipality of Bluewater.  The by-law in issue here is Stanley Township’s
    zoning by-law #22-1985 and it continued to apply.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2001, the appellant applied to the respondent Municipality for a building
    permit in order to increase the capacity of their<i> </i>pig farm from 700
    pigs to 1,350 pigs.  Hill also applied to the local Committee of Adjustment
    for three minor variances to accommodate the proposed construction.  Section
    4.5 of this by-law provides that the erection or expansion of a livestock
    facility must comply with the minimum distance separation (MDS II) for new
    or expanding livestock facilities set out by the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture,
    Food and Rural Affairs.  Section 29 of the by-law stipulates how the MDS
    II requirements are to be calculated.  Two of the variances sought by Hill
    were for relief from the MDS II requirements.  MDS II requires that a new
    or expanding agricultural operation that is located in the vicinity of an
    institutional use be sited double the distance required from an ordinary
    neighbour, a requirement known as “ the doubling factor”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hill’s
    farm is located next to the Stanley Township Municipal Complex, a community
    centre and institution.  The evidence appears to be undisputed that the land
    upon which the Complex is located had been used for municipal purposes for
    a number of years before the Stanley Complex was built in 1984.  It was often
    used for picnics and ball diamonds most evenings from May until September
    each year. The complex houses municipal offices and an auditorium that is
    rented for weddings and used for other community events on a regular basis. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    a hearing, the Municipality dismissed Hill’s application for variances.  Hill
    then reduced the size of its proposed expansion plans and the number of animal
    units, and made a fresh application for minor variances but this application
    was also dismissed. Hill did not appeal that decision to the Ontario Municipal
    Board within the time limits for appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hill
    next applied to the Normal Farm Practices Protection Board on the basis that
    its proposed expansion was a “normal farm practice”
    that the by-law restricted. The Board, whose decision will be discussed in
    greater detail, held that the proposed expansion was not a normal farm practice.  The
    Board held, however, that Hill’s proposed operation would be a normal farm
    practice if he were relieved of the doubling factor and in effect held he
    did not have to comply with the by-law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Municipality appealed the board’s decision to the Divisional Court.  The
    essence of the Court’s reasons, reported at 75 O.R. (3d) 352, is contained
    in the following passages:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[21] A “
    municipal by-law”, as used in section 6, does not include a zoning by-law.  Rather,
    section 6(1) and (2) are intended to refer to municipal by-laws which deal
    with matters prohibiting or regulating nuisances and disturbances of the
    type referred to in the preamble of FFPPA.  This is one of those rare instances
    in which a court should not give effect to the literal meaning of a word
    where the context shows overwhelmingly that the Legislature intended that
    it should be given a more restricted interpretation.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>….</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[30] Accordingly, it is our view that the jurisdiction
    of the Board is confined generally to matters involving the protection of
    farmers who cause inevitable nuisances and disturbances to others by giving
    farms the right to do so provided that their farming operations fall within
    the definition of ‘normal farming practice’.  The Board has no jurisdiction
    to interfere with matters pertaining to land use such as arose in the circumstances
    of this case.  Minor variances and spot rezoning are matters that fall exclusively
    within the various processes recognized by the Planning Act [R.S.O. 1990,
    c. P.13].  Moreover, section 71 of the Planning Act provides that, in the
    event of conflict between the provisions of that Act and any other general
    or special Act, the provisions of the Planning Act prevail. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Divisional Court gave several reasons in support of its conclusion.  1) Nothing
    in the preamble or <i>FFPPA</i> itself confers authority on the Board to
    deal with matters involving land use planning. 2) Minor variances and spot
    rezoning are matters that fall exclusively under the <i>Planning Act</i> which
    provides that in the event of conflict between the provisions of that Act
    and any other Act the provisions of the <i>Planning Act</i> prevail.  3)
    Land use matters, especially those which involve zoning issues, can have
    enormous ramifications not only for owners of the land involved but also
    for the community as a whole. Therefore, they ought to be considered not
    by the Board, but rather by those persons who have expertise in areas of
    law and land planning and who are required to safeguard the public interest
    (<i>e.g</i>. Committees of Adjustment or municipal councils). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants sought and obtained leave to appeal the decision of the Divisional
    Court.  The issues I propose to address on this appeal are:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-GB>(1)       Did the Divisional Court err in determining that
      the term “municipal by-law” as it is used in s. 6 of the FFPPA does not
      include a zoning by-law?  In other words, did the Divisional Court err
      in determining that the Board did not have jurisdiction to decide whether
      a practice is a normal farm practice when the by-law that allegedly restricts
      the practice is a zoning by-law. </span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-GB>(2)       If the Divisional Court erred and the Board did
      have jurisdiction to consider Hill’s application, what is the appropriate

  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-GB>(3)       On a proper application of the standard of review

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>1.   Did the Divisional Court
      err in determining that the term “municipal by-law” as it is used in s.
      6 of the FFPPA does not include a zoning by-law?  </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    reasons that lead me to conclude that the Court erred in its interpretation
    are derived from the application of the modern approach to statutory interpretation
    that is set out by E.A. Driedger in the <i>Construction of Statutes </i>(2d
    ed. Toronto: Butterworths 1983), at p. 87:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Today there is only one principle or approach,
    namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in
    their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the
    Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Driedger‘s
    modern approach has been cited and relied on by the Supreme Court of Canada
    on numerous occasions:  See <i>e.g.</i> <i>Rizzo v. Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), </i>[1998]
    1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21; <i>Bell Express Vu Limited Partnership v. Rex, </i>[2002]
    2 S.C.R. 559 at para. 26; <i>H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General), </i>[2005]
    1 S.C.R. 401, at paras. 186-187; <i>Chieu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship
    and Immigration), </i>[2002] 1 S.C.R. 84 at para. 27; Contino<i> v. Leonelli-Contino, </i>[2005]
    3 S.C.R. 217, at para. 19 and <i>Canada 3000 Inc., Re, </i>2006 S.C.C. 24
    at para. 36.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have indicated, a central issue on this appeal is the Divisional Court’s
    interpretation of the term, “municipal by-law” in s. 6(1) as excluding a
    zoning by-law.  That interpretation led the court to conclude that the Board
    lacked jurisdiction to decide whether the Municipality’s zoning by-law restricted
    a normal farm practice. Applying Driedger’s approach to statutory interpretation,
    there are five reasons why the Divisional Court erred in its interpretation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First
    the ordinary meaning of the words “municipal by-law”
    includes a zoning by-law and the Divisional Court acknowledged as much. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    regard to the object of the Act and the legislator’s intent in enacting the
    Act as a whole means consideration must be given to the preamble of the <i>FFPPA</i>.  The
    preamble of the <i>FFPPA</i> makes clear that it is not simply intended to
    address nuisances arising from agricultural operations but, more broadly,
    to address issues that arise from the competing interests of agricultural
    operations and adjacent properties.  The preamble states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is desirable to conserve, protect and encourage
    the development and improvement of agricultural lands for the production
    of food, fibre and other agricultural or horticultural products.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Agricultural activities may include intensive operations
    that may cause discomfort and inconveniences to those on adjacent lands.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Because of the pressures exerted on the agricultural
    community, it is increasingly difficult for agricultural owners and operators
    to effectively produce food, fibre and other agricultural and horticultural
    products. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is in the provincial interest that in agricultural
    areas, the agricultural uses and normal farm practices be promoted and protected
    in a way that balances the needs of the agricultural community with provincial
    health, safety and environmental concerns.  </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>Because the <i>FFPPA</i> is intended
    to address competing land uses, an inference can be drawn that the legislature
    intended the Board to have the power to consider zoning by&#8209;laws which
    regulate the use of land in a municipality. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    Subsection 2(5) states that the <i>FFPPA</i> is subject to the Environmental
    Protection Act, the Pesticides Act and the Ontario Water Resources Act.  It
    does not state that the <i>FFPPA</i> is subject to the <i>Planning Act</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    the scheme of the Act is fleshed out by subsection 6(15) of <i>FFPPA</i> which
    requires the Board, in deciding whether a practice is a normal farm practice
    for purposes of the non-application of a municipal by-law, to consider, among
    other things, “[t]he effect of the practice on abutting lands and neighbours” and “[w]hether
    the by-law reflects a provincial interest as established under any other
    piece of legislation or policy statement”.  Viewed in combination, sections
    2(5) and 6(15), lend strong support to the conclusion that the Board is empowered
    to consider competing land use issues and any provincial planning policies.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifth,
    because meaning is derived from context, statutory interpretation requires
    us to determine whether the ordinary meaning of the words is rationally related
    to the purpose of the legislation.  According to Ruth Sullivan, in <i>Sullivan
    And Driedger on the Construction of Statutes, </i>4th ed. (Toronto: Butterworths,
    2002) at p. 223, modern drafters of legislation tend to write provisions
    using general language applicable to a number of situations, as opposed to
    drafting narrow, precise provisions.  The result, in her opinion, is a legislative
    style that is often vague and over- rather than under- inclusive.  When the
    ordinary meaning of legislation is too broad, Sullivan states that judges
    employ purposive analysis to narrow its scope, “by excluding applications
    within the ordinary meaning that are not rationally related to the purpose.”  <i>Canada
    3000, supra, </i>is an example where the Supreme Court employed a purposive
    analysis to adopt a narrower interpretation of the word “owner” in s. 55(1)
    of the <i>Civil Air Navigation Services Commercialization Act, </i>S.C. 1996,
    c.&nbsp;20 so as to exclude legal titleholders from being liable to pay for
    civil air navigational services rendered.  Binnie J. held that the intent
    of that Act was to create a “user&#8209;pay” scheme for civil air navigational
    services, and that the only “users” of the civil air navigational services
    within the contemplation of the Act were the airlines who lease the aircraft
    from the legal titleholders, not the legal titleholders themselves.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    having regard to the history of the legislation, another factor that comprises
    the “entire context” of the legislation, a narrow interpretation of the term “municipal
    by-law” would not accord with the purpose of the legislative scheme.  The
    Act that preceded the existing legislation was the <i>Farm Practices Protection
    Act, 1988, </i>S.O. 1988, c.62 which was repealed by the <i>FFPPA</i> effective
    May 11, 1998.  The predecessor legislation protected a farmer from claims
    in nuisance for any odour, noise or dust resulting from the farmer’s agricultural
    operation due to a normal farm practice provided that the farmer complied
    with “any land use control law”, as well as with the <i>Environmental Protection
    Act, </i>the <i>Pesticides Act, </i>the <i>Health Protection and Promotion
    Act,</i> and the <i>Ontario Water Resources Act.</i>  A “land use control
    law” under the 1988 Act was defined in s. 1 as “ any Act and any regulation,
    plan or by-law made under the authority of an Act that restricts or prescribes
    the use to which land or premises may be put or the nature of business or
    activities that may be carried on on any land or premises.”  That definition
    captures a zoning by-law.  The current <i>FFPPA </i>no longer requires<i> </i>compliance
    with these specified statutes before a farmer can bring an application for
    protection from nuisance claims: <i>Pyke v. Tri Gro Enterprises Ltd. </i>(2001),
    55 O.R. (3d) 257, at para. 19. However, in the event a farmer has a charge
    pending relating to a nuisance or disturbance due to his alleged non-compliance
    with the<i> Environmental Protection Act, The Pesticides Act, the Health
    Protection and Promotion Act, </i>or the <i>Ontario Water Resources Act</i> a
    court may issue an injunction or order that prohibits the farmer from carrying
    on the agricultural operation allegedly in contravention of the specified
    statutes.  A “land use control law” has been omitted from the list of specified
    statutes for which an injunction may issue.  Moreover, subsection 2(5) now
    makes the <i>FFPPA</i> expressly subject to the <i>Environmental Protection
    Act, Pesticides Act </i>and the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    <i>Ontario</i><i> Water Resources Act.</i>  Again a “land use control law” has
    been omitted from the list.  At the same time, the 1998 <i>FFPPA</i> introduced
    section 6(1) which states that a municipal by-law does not apply if it restricts
    a normal farm practice.  Assuming without deciding that the term
    “municipal by-law” was ambiguous and could be read either as including a
    zoning by-law or not, t<span lang=EN-US>he reading that best gives effect
    to the intention of the legislator on a consistent basis is to be preferred
    over one that results in interpretations going in different directions.  </span>Here,
    the legislator’s intention is that a “land use control law” no longer takes
    precedence over the <i>FFPPA</i> and consistency requires us to interpret
    municipal by-law as including a zoning by&#8209;law.  For these reasons,
    the

    omitting a “land use control law” from the <i>FFPPA, </i>the legislator’s
    intention was not, however, to give the Board <i>carte blanche</i> to determine
    what constitutes a normal farm practice.  The Board is required to consider
    four factors in determining whether a practice is a normal farm practice:
    s. 6(15).  One of the factors is whether the by-law that allegedly restricts
    a normal farm practice reflects a provincial interest contained in other
    legislation or a policy statement: s. 6(15).  Further, the Board’s decision
    must be consistent with guidelines or policy statements of the Minister of
    Agriculture or those of another Ministry adopted by the Minister: s. 9.  Thus,
    if a zoning by-law adopts a provincial policy statement of the Ministry of
    Agriculture, the Board’s decision must be consistent with it. <i> </i>In
    addition, if a farm practice is consistent with a regulation under the <i>Nutrient
    Management Act, 2002,</i>the Board must determine that the practice is a
    normal farm practice: s. 6.1.</p>

    turning to the next issue in this appeal, further brief comment must also
    be made on the reasons the Divisional Court gave for its conclusion that
    a zoning by-law was not included in the definition of municipal by-law. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    support of its conclusion that the Board did not have jurisdiction to consider
    zoning by-laws under s. 6(1) of the <i>FFPPA</i>, the Divisional Court observed
    that minor variances and spot rezoning were matters coming exclusively within
    the various processes recognized by the <i>Planning Act. </i> Section 6 of
    the <i>Planning Act</i> implies that other boards will be involved in considering
    aspects of the <i>Planning Act</i> since it requires any government board
    or agency to consult with, and have regard for, the planning policies of
    the municipality. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>6.(1) In this section,&#8194;</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>“ministry”
    means any ministry or secretariat of the Government of Ontario and includes
        a board, commission or agency of the Government.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b><span lang=EN>Planning policies</span></b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>(2) A ministry, before carrying out

  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN>Thus, the legislature
      has contemplated that other administrative bodies may apply planning<i> </i>policies.  To
      the extent that the Divisional Court was concerned that the Board lacked
      the expertise of other decision-making bodies, such as Committees of Adjustment
      or municipal councils, in land use matters, that fact is not, in itself,
      a reason for concluding that the Board should not decide the issue before
      it.  See by analogy <i>Tranchemontagne v. Ontario (Director, DisabilitySupport
      Program)</i> [2006] S.C.J. No. 14. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Divisional Court also relied on section 71 of the <i>Planning Act</i> which
    provides that, in the event of conflict between the provisions of that <i>Act</i> and
    any other general or special Act, the provisions of the <i>Planning Act</i> prevail.  As
    Blair J.A. observed in dissent, but not on this point, in <i>Peacock v. The
    Corporation of Norfolk County, </i>(Ont. C.A.), June 28, 2006, at para. 82,
    s. 71 is not dispositive because,”… the conflict is not between the provisions
    of the two Acts…”. Insofar as the Divisional Court relied on the supremacy
    of s. 71 of the <i>Planning Act </i>as a basis for holding that the Board
    did not have jurisdiction, the conflict is not between the provisions of
    the <i>Planning Act </i>and the <i>Farming and Food Production Protection
    Act</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Divisional Court supported its conclusion that the term municipal by-law
    as used in s. 6(1) did not include a zoning by-law because nothing in the
    preamble or elsewhere in the <em>FFPPA </em>conferred authority on the Board
    to deal with matters that traditionally fell within the traditional scope
    of land use planning. Having made the determination that the Act did not
    expressly empower the Board to deal with matters involving land use planning,
    the Divisional Court, in accordance with administrative law principles, did
    not end its analysis there. The Divisional Court was required to go on and
    determine whether the Board had implied jurisdiction to deal with the zoning
    by-law, a land use planning matter. Assuming that the term, &ldquo;municipal
    by-law&rdquo; is ambiguous, if a tribunal is empowered to decide questions
    of law, a presumption arises that it has implied jurisdiction to deal with
    other enactments that arise in the course of a case properly before it: <em>Nova
    Scotia (Workers&rsquo; Compensation Board) v. Martin</em> [2003] 2 S.C.R.
    504, at paras 33 and 45; <em>Paul v. British Columbia (Forest Appeals Commission)</em>,
    [2003] 2 S.C.R. 585 at paras.8 and 41. The rationale for the presumption
    is that it is undesirable for a tribunal to shut its eyes to some of the
    law when deciding a legal issue and that doing so could ultimately lead to
    a denial of justice or other protracted proceedings. The presumption may
    be rebutted if the legislature has restricted the tribunal&rsquo;s jurisdiction
    because tribunals are creatures of statute. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    can be no doubt the <i>FFPPA</i> gives the Board the implied power to determine
    questions of law.  Section 8(2) of the <i>FFPPA</i> provides for an appeal
    from the decision of the Board on any question of fact, law or jurisdiction
    to the Divisional Court.  As well, the Board may dismiss an application if
    it is of the opinion that the application is frivolous or vexatious.  A further
    consideration is whether the Board fulfills a function that is adjudicative
    in nature.  When, as here, the Board holds a hearing, and gives reasons for
    its decision, it is fulfilling a function that is adjudicative in nature.  Nothing
    in the <i>FFPPA </i>specifically restricts the Board’s power to deal with
    a zoning by-law enacted pursuant to the <i>Planning Act</i>, in determining
    what constitutes a normal farm practice.  Thus, in addition to the modern
    approach to statutory interpretation, the application of administrative law
    principles would lead to the conclusion that the Board, in considering a
    question properly before it, namely, whether a farm practice was a normal
    farm practice, had jurisdiction to deal with the Municipality’s zoning by-law. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is possible to read the Divisional Court’s reasons as holding that s.&nbsp;6(3)
    did not authorize the Board to consider whether a proposed expansion of a
    farming operation would be a normal farm practice as opposed to whether a
    proposed new operation would be a normal farm practice and that, as a result,
    the application was not properly before the Board.  If so, I would respectfully
    disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> For
    ease of reference s. 6(3) is reproduced below:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3) An application may be made by,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) farmers who are directly affected by a municipal
    by-law that may have the effect of restricting a normal farm practice in
    connection with an agricultural operation; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) persons who want to engage in a normal farm
    practice as part of an agricultural operation on land in the municipality
    and have demonstrable plans for it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relation to s.&nbsp;6(3)(b), the Board held, “We interpret this to mean that
    an Applicant may come to this Board with demonstrable plans for an expansion
    and ask the Board to determine whether or not the proposed expansion will
    be a normal farm practice for purposes of a non-application of a Municipal
    by-law.”  I agree with the Board’s conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Subsection
    6(3)(b) empowers the Board to decide if a farm practice not yet engaged in
    would be a normal farm practice.  Both new farming proposals and proposals
    for expansion are encompassed by the wording of the section, “want to engage
    in a normal farm practice” and there is no principled reason to distinguish
    between them.  Whether the proposed swine operation is a new operation or
    an expansion of an existing operation, the effect in terms of nuisance would
    be the same if the total number of animals is the same.  In addition to the
    wording of the subsection, the preamble to FFPPA also supports the interpretation
    that the Legislature intended to give the Board jurisdiction to deal with
    a proposed expansion.  The preamble provides, in part, that “It is desirable
    to conserve, protect and encourage the development and improvement of agricultural
    lands&nbsp;…”.  The use of the word “improvement” would clearly apply to
    expansions.</p>

    conclusion that the Divisional Court erred in holding that the Board did
    not have jurisdiction to consider whether the proposed expansion was a normal
    farm practice restricted by the zoning by-law is not, however, dispositive
    of this appeal.  I must now go on to review the Board’s decision.  That exercise
    in turn requires me to determine the standard of review applicable to the
    Board’s decisions, the second issue in this appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>2.   What is the appropriate
      standard of review of the Board’s decision? </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are three standards for judicial review of administrative decisions: correctness,
    reasonableness and patent unreasonableness.  In order to determine which
    standard applies, and therefore the extent of deference to be accorded to
    the decision of an administrative tribunal, a court must employ the pragmatic
    and functional approach.  Pursuant to this approach, four factors are considered:
    a) the presence or absence of a privative clause or statutory right of appeal
    (although the absence of a privative clause or existence of a broad right
    of appeal is not, in itself, determinative that less deference may be due
    to the tribunal’s decisions); b) the expertise of the tribunal relative to
    that of the reviewing court on the issue in question; c) the purposes of
    the legislation and the provision in particular; and d) the nature of the
    question, namely, law, fact, or mixed fact and law: see <i>Law Society of
    New Brunswick v. Ryan,  </i>(2003), 223 D.L.R. (4th) 577 (S.C.C.) , [2003]
    1 S.C.R. 247 at paras, 20, 27, 29.  <b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying
    those factors to the instant case, I conclude that the standard of review
    is reasonableness.  FFPPA contains no privative clause.  Rather, as noted
    pursuant to s. 8(2), there is a broad right of appeal to the Divisional Court
    on any question of fact, law or jurisdiction.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the expertise of this Board was the subject of judicial comment by Charron
    J.A. in dissent, in <i>Pyke v. Tri Gro Enterprises, supra,</i> whose comments
    in this regard were adopted by the majority Sharpe and Abella JJ.A.  Charron
    J.A. observed at para. 56 of her reasons that, “The [Normal Farm Practices
    Protection] Board is an administrative tribunal that has been constituted
    with the particular expertise to achieve the purposes of the legislation.  It
    also has the power to appoint experts to assist it in performing<i> </i>any
    of its functions: s.&nbsp;8(3).”  She went on to note that the Board’s power
    to inquire into and resolve a dispute in an informal manner could present
    significant advantages over the traditional court system.  In this regard,
    she pointed to the fact that all but about 1% of the total complaints received
    by Ministry staff respecting nuisances under the <i>FFPPA </i>end in a Board
    hearing and even where a hearing does take place, the less formal hearings
    resulted in the entire process being more accessible to the unrepresented
    litigant.  She also observed that the Board’s extensive powers of relief
    could, in certain cases, be more suitable to the needs of the parties.  Although
    the Board does not have exclusive jurisdiction over complaints created by
    agricultural operations, having regard to the expertise of the Board, the
    Court was unanimous in its opinion that, absent special circumstances, such
    complaints should generally first be brought before the Board before any
    action in nuisance is brought in court. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    regard to expertise, it is also important to note that the Board consists
    of not fewer than five members appointed by the Minister of Agriculture for
    a term not exceeding three years and those members of the Board who are not
    public servants of Ontario are paid for their services: see s. 3 generally
    and s. 3(7) in particular of the <i>FFPPA</i>.  Thus, the Board is not necessarily
    an independent tribunal.  The members of the Board need not be legally trained.  They
    may, however, be in a better position than a court to understand how a particular
    agricultural operation will affect the local residents.  In addition, as
    noted in <i>Tri-Gro </i>at para 58, the Board has extensive powers of relief
    that may be more suitable to the needs of the parties.  The Boards procedures
    are governed by the <i>Statutory Powers and Procedures Act,</i> R.S.O. 1990,
    c. S.&nbsp;22: <i>FFPPA&nbsp;</i>s.&nbsp;3(8).<i> </i> Thus, the Board’s
    expertise favours a standard of deference on matters within its jurisdiction.<i> </i></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Insofar
    as the nature of the question is concerned, the question of whether a farm
    practice is a normal farm practice is a question of mixed law and fact, since
    it involves the application of a legal standard to a set of facts: <i>Housen
    v. Nikolaison, </i>[2002] 2 S.C.R. 235 at para 26.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span

    the pragmatic and functional approach, I would conclude that although there
    is a statutory appeal from decisions of the Board, the nature of the question
    before the Court, a question of mixed fact and law, the expertise of the
    Board and its broad power to stipulate what would be a normal farm practice,
    suggest a more deferential standard of review than correctness.  Thus, the
    appropriate standard of review of the Board’s decision is reasonableness
    and this Court may only intervene if the decision is shown to be unreasonable. </p>

    Board considered whether Hill’s proposed expansion would be a normal farm
    practice, and it concluded that it would not be.  The Board concluded that: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Having reviewed the site specific circumstances
    it is our opinion that locating the swine barns where proposed by the Applicant,
    would not be a normal farm practice, because alternate suitable locations
    for the new barns are available which locations would provide an acceptable
    separation distance from the institutional use and at the same time be cost
    efficient in terms of construction, labour and management.</p>

    Board held that although the locating of the swine barns proposed by Hill
    would not be a normal farm practice, he should not have to bear an increased
    cost to expand his farming operation because of the MDS requirements in the
    by-law.  The reasons expressed by the Board include the following: Hill was
    engaged in swine farming at the time the complex was built; he had no way
    of objecting to the by-law; it was foreseeable a conflict would develop;
    the purpose of the by-law was to minimize disturbance from institutional
    use and there had been no complaints from the existing operation.  </p>

    Board also held that compliance with MDS II did not appear to be the sole
    determining factor as to whether a farmer was carrying on a normal farm practice.  Pursuant
    to s. 6(15) of the <i>FFPPA, </i>the Board is required to consider four factors
    in determining whether a practice is a normal farm practice.  They are: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1. The purpose of the by-law that has the effect
    of restricting the farm practice</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2. The effect of the farm practice on abutting
    lands and neighbours.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3. Whether the by-law reflects a provincial interest
    as established under any other piece of legislation or policy statement</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4. The specific circumstances pertaining to the

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    already commented on the specific circumstances pertaining to Hill, the Board
    commented on the other three factors.  It concluded that the purpose of requiring
    compliance with MDS II in the zoning by-law was to minimize the disturbance
    to institutional use, in this case, the odour from the expanded swine operation.  As
    there was no evidence of complaint due to odour from Hill’s existing operations,
    the Board  “anticipated” that its decision would not have a negative effect
    upon the abutting land, that is, the complex, despite the increased size
    of the operation.  The Board indicated an awareness of MDS II as being part
    of the agricultural code of practice as well as the 1996 Provincial Policy
    statement under s.3 of the <i>Planning Act</i>.  Section3 of the <i>Planning
    Act,</i> required that the Board, “ shall have regard to policy statements…”.  The
    MDS II guidelines are an example of such a provincial policy statement.  The
    Board also noted that in 1995, when MDS II was being adopted as a by-law,
    some local governments had adopted bylaws that lessened the setback distance
    for some institutional uses to a factor of 1.0.  The Board further observed
    that municipal officials could grant a minor variance from MDS II after consulting
    with the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs when considering
    a variance application.</p>

'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted, the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs directive
    entitled “Minimum Distance Separation II (MDSII)” sets out minimum distance
    separation requirements for new or expanding livestock facilities from existing
    (or approved) development.  In this case, compliance with MDS II guidelines
    required a setback of 604 metres (302 metres multiplied by a factor of 2
    or double the distance that would ordinarily be required from the nearest
    neighbour).  The Municipality enacted the provincial guidelines into its
    by&#8209;law.  Section 9 of the <i>FFPPA</i> requires that the Board’s decisions
    be consistent with Ministry of Agriculture directives, guidelines or policy
    statements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    commenting that certain municipalities had enacted bylaws requiring a lesser
    setback from institutional uses, the Board appears to have ignored the fact
    that, at the time the municipalities passed those by&#8209;laws, s.&nbsp;9
    did not exist. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fact that municipal officials may grant a minor variance to a by-law is irrelevant
    to the Board’s jurisdiction.  Administrative bodies only have the jurisdiction
    conferred on them directly or implicitly.  The Board paid no heed to the
    limitation on the exercise of its power imposed by jurisdiction in s.&nbsp;9
    of the <i>FFPPA</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the Board was engaged in determining whether an agricultural operation, which
    was directly affected by a municipal by-law, was a normal farm practice.  The
    Board purported to make its order pursuant to s. 5(4)(c) of the <i>FFPPA</i> which
    gives it the power to order a farmer to modify his “practice” so that it
    is consistent with ”normal farm practice”.  I have serious reservations as
    to whether the exercise undertaken by the Board resulted in the modification
    of a “normal farm practice”.  Both the comments of Sharpe J.A. for the majority
    at paras 80 and 81, and Charron J.A., in dissent at para 59, in <i>Tri&#8209;Gro,
    supra, </i>support the conclusion that a normal farm practice and, consequently,
    an order modifying that practice under s. 5(4)(c), relates to farming techniques
    and methods that are of a requisite standard or established and followed
    by similar agricultural operations, not to making orders that a farmer need
    not comply with a by-law concerning the minimum distance for locating his
    barn from another use.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    deciding whether an agricultural operation that is directly affected by a
    municipal by-law is a normal farm practice, the Board is required to balance
    four factors.  The third factor is whether the by-law reflects a provincial
    interest as expressed in a policy statement.  This factor is to be considered
    and weighed with the other three factors.  The Board did consider the guidelines
    in reaching its decision and therefore Hill submits that the Board had “regard
    for” the policy statement.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Board’s conclusion was a conclusion it drew after applying s 6(15) of the <i>FFPPA, </i>not
    s. 9.  Irrespective of what the Board may have concluded as to whether a
    practice is a normal farm practice after applying s6 (15), s.9 requires that
    the Board’s decision be consistent with the Minister of Agriculture’s directives,
    guidelines or policy statements. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Board’s comment that its decision did not contradict the policy statement
    was unreasonable.  Subsection 2.1.4 of the policy statement in effect at
    the relevant time required that “…new or expanding livestock facilities will
    comply with the minimum distance separation formulae”.  The Board’s order
    directly contradicted the plain wording of the policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Board referred to the MDS II as being a ‘guideline’.  The Board, however,
    does not refer to the Farm Practices Position Statement issued by the Ontario
    Ministry of Agriculture Food and Rural Affairs in 1998, the year that the <i>FFPPA</i>,
    was adopted.  That Position Statement’s purpose was to “clearly state the
    Ministry’s position and to <i>give direction</i> on matters and issues related
    to farming and normal farm practices” [emphasis added].  The last paragraph
    of the Statement refers to Minimum Distance Separation, stating, <i>inter
    alia</i>, that new or expanding livestock facilities are to comply with the
    MDS formulae
    ‘as per Provincial Policy Statement under the Planning Act’.  The direction
    given in this Position Statement clearly falls within the provisions of s.
    9 of the <i>FFPPA</i>.  It was in effect at the time of the Board’s determination.  It
    constitutes more than a ‘guideline’ and was binding by the Board.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Board was satisfied that the location of the barns as dictated by its decision
    adequately addressed the Municipality’s concerns regarding separation distance.  As
    I have indicated, the concerns were not those of the Municipality alone.  The
    Municipality’s by-law reflected a provincial policy directive with which
    the Board’s decision was required to be consistent.   </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Conclusion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Board’s decision cannot stand.  Pursuant to s. 9(1) of the <i>FFPPA, </i>the
    Board was required to ensure that its decision in this case was consistent
    with the Ministry’s MDS II guidelines.  Compliance with the Ministry’s MDS
    II guidelines would have required the appellant’s closest proposed barn to
    be located 604 metres from the institutional zone occupied by the Stanley
    Complex.  Instead, the Board permitted a setback of only 302 metres.  This
    result<a name="OLE_LINK1"> – </a>a reduction by half of the required setback
    distance – simply cannot be said to be consistent with the MDS II guidelines.  The
    Board could not ignore section 9 and render a decision that was inconsistent
    with the MDS II guidelines.  It’s decision was unreasonable.</p>
