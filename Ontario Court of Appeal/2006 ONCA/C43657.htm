    December 10, 2004, the respondent, Cavell Insurance Company Limited, brought
    an application in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice in the
    United Kingdom for approval of a scheme of arrangement under s. 425 of the <i>Companies
    Act</i>, <i>1985 </i>(U.K.), 1985, c. 6. On December 20, 2004 that court
    granted an initial order in the application, ordering Cavell to convene a
    meeting of its creditors affected by the scheme, and providing for the location
    and notice to be given for the meeting.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fundamental question in this proceeding is whether that initial order can
    properly be recognized in Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    December 21, 2004, Farley J. issued an order recognizing the U.K. order and
    adding a number of terms to “implement” that order. On February 17, 2005
    he issued a second order continuing his earlier order with several further
    conditions. This is the appeal from those orders.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    rested his orders on both the <i>Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgements (U.K.)
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, C.R-6 (<i>REJUKA</i>) and the rules of private international
    law. For the reasons that follow, I would sustain his orders. I would do
    so not on the basis of <i>REJUKA</i>, but on the basis of private international
    law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'><b>BACKGROUND TO THE APPEAL
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Cavell
    was incorporated in 1919 under the laws of England, with the principal object
    of carrying on the business of reinsurance. Over the years, it wrote reinsurance
    policies in the London market, and overseas, through branches in South Africa,
    Australia, New Zealand and Canada.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    Canada, Cavell primarily reinsured insurers writing casualty policies covering
    claims such as those arising from pollution, asbestos, sexual abuse, tobacco
    and tainted blood. These types of claims are sometimes referred to as “long
    tail” claims because they may come to light many years after the policies
    are written, and may take many more years for coverage and quantum issues
    to be resolved.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    December 2004, Cavell’s business in Canada represented approximately 7.5%
    of its total, estimated on the basis of claims to be paid. As of the fall
    of 2004, in addition to its contracts of reinsurance with Canadian insurers,
    Cavell had total assets in Canada of approximately $23,149,000, of which
    $20,849,000 were held in trust, as required by the relevant insurance company
    legislation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the mid 1990’s, Cavell stopped writing new reinsurance business but continued
    to administer the “run-off” of its existing reinsurance business, paying
    the insurers it had reinsured from its reserves as claims arose.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2004, Cavell decided to bring an end to its reinsurance run-off business.
    It proposed to implement a scheme of arrangement with its policy holders
    that would, in effect, bring to an end its contracts of reinsurance with
    them. The scheme provided for the valuation as of December 31, 2004 of all
    present, future and contingent claims of the policyholders against Cavell,
    and for the immediate payment of those claims in full without discount for
    present valuing. Since Cavell is a solvent company, this is known as a solvent
    scheme of arrangement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cavell
    proposed to implement the scheme by way of the procedure provided by s. 425
    of the U.K.<i> Companies Act, 1985</i>. For the scheme to be binding on the
    company and its creditors, that section requires that a majority of the relevant
    creditors, in number representing not less than 75% in value of those creditors
    present and voting in person or by proxy, vote in favour of the scheme at
    a meeting convened with the permission of the court. The U.K. court must
    then sanction the scheme. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cavell
    took the first step in this process by obtaining the order of December 20,
    2004 from the High Court of Justice in the U.K. That order authorized the
    company to convene a meeting of creditors to consider, and if thought fit,
    approve the scheme with or without modification. It fixed a location for
    the meeting, provided for the giving of notice of the meeting, required details
    of the scheme to be made accessible to the creditors, and appointed a chair
    of the meeting who was ordered to report the results to the court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Canadian policyholders were not served with the papers for the December 20
    proceeding, received no notice of it and did not appear in the U.K. court.
    However, in mid-November, Cavell had circulated a letter to them advising
    that it would be applying for leave to hold a meeting of creditors and that
    a court application was expected to take place in early to mid December.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    obtaining the December 20 order, Cavell filed with the U.K. court an explanatory
    statement indicating that it would apply in Canada for an order recognizing
    the U.K. proceedings and the U.K. order of December 20, and confirming the
    directions given by the U.K. court in relation to the convening of the meeting
    of creditors. The purpose of doing so was to ensure that the Canadian court
    would recognize the scheme as binding on Cavell’s Canadian creditors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cavell
    proceeded with this step by applying to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice
    on December 21, 2004 for an order recognizing the U.K.<i> </i>proceedings
    and recognizing and implementing the U.K. order of December 20. It also sought
    a stay of proceedings in respect of its Canadian property, and advice or
    direction in connection with Cavell’s application to approve the scheme and
    the meeting ordered to consider the scheme.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cavell
    served its Canadian creditors with the material for this application. The
    appellant, like many of those creditors, did not attend before the motion
    judge on December 21. However, counsel for one Canadian insurer and for the
    office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) did appear. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Farley
    J. heard the Cavell application on December 21, 2004, and granted the order
    sought. In brief reasons, he found that there was a real and substantial
    connection between the subject matter of the proceeding under s. 425 of the
    U.K.<i> Companies Act, 1985</i> and the U.K. court, and that it was appropriate
    to recognize the December 20 order of that court. In doing so, he relied
    on <i>REJUKA</i> (together with Rule 73 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>)
    and the inherent jurisdiction of the Ontario Superior Court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    issued, Farley J.’s order of December 21, 2004 recited in its preamble the
    need to recognize and co-ordinate the actions before the U.K. court and the
    application brought in Ontario. In addition to ordering that the U.K. order
    of December 20 be recognized, the Ontario order contained a number of additional
    terms which may be grouped as follows:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>a)            an order that the U.K. proceedings be recognized;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    the U.K. proceedings and implementing the U.K. order of December 20 and any

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that
    Cavell keep the Ontario court advised of any material developments in the

    orders from the Ontario court needed to co-ordinate the two proceedings;</p>

    notice of the meeting and access to documents be provided to Canadian creditors;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>c)            an order banning other proceedings against
    Cavell or its Canadian property in connection with the scheme of arrangement
    except with leave of the Ontario court;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>d)            a
    “comeback” provision entitling any interested party to return to the court
    for further order, or to amend or vary the December 21 order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    February 17, 2005, fifteen of the Canadian insurers, including the appellant,
    utilized the “comeback” provision and sought to set aside or vary the December
    21 order. In reasons issued on February 21, Farley J. dismissed their motions
    and continued the recognition order, but added four conditions to it. He
    described the three principal ones as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>1. The UK Scheme Adjudicator is to reach a commutation valuation based on the
    OSFI rules ...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>2. Given the uniqueness of the OSFI rules to be only applicable to Canadian
    carriers being reinsured by Cavell, there is to be a further right of appeal
    to this court on this point, recognizing that the Scheme Adjudicator would
    lose jurisdiction completely if he did not truly apply the OSFI rules.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>3. There is to be a videotape taken of a meeting on February 23<sup>rd</sup> and
    a transcript made. …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his reasons, Farley J. reviewed the notification that had been provided in
    several ways of the December 21 application and found that it was “not insufficient.”  He
    confirmed his view that a basis existed under either <i>REJUKA</i> and Rule
    73, or the inherent jurisdiction of the court to make the recognition order
    of December 21. He also held that the U.K. order of December 20, although
    not for the payment of money, was sufficiently precise to be enforceable
    in Ontario. Finally, he made it clear that the provisions of s. 425 of the  <i>U.K.
    Companies Act</i>,<i> 1985</i> are neither foreign nor repugnant to the Canadian
    court and that an order facilitating access to that process for those in
    Canada affected by it, was desirable and consistent with the requirements
    of comity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the hearing on February 17, a dispute arose over the form of the order to
    be taken out, resulting in a re-attendance before Farley J. In reasons released
    April 22, 2005, he clarified two things. First, the OSFI rules to which he
    had referred in the recognition order are <i>Canadian Generally Accepted
    Actuarial Principles</i>. Second, he made clear that his primary intention
    in his February 21 reasons was to ensure that an appeal was available if
    the valuation done in the U.K. proceedings was not conducted by applying
    the OSFI rules. He stated that his reference to the appeal being to the Ontario
    court was a very peripheral point, and that it would be appropriate for the
    right of appeal to be to the U.K. court as an alternative. With this clarification,
    the order of  February 17, 2005  was issued.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            Any

    a court, which if it were a judgment for the payment of a sum of money could
    be registered under this Convention</u>, shall, unless registration has been
    or would be refused or set aside on any ground other than that the judgment
    has been satisfied or could not be enforced in the territory of origin, be

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    making his recognition order of December 21, 2004, Farley J. relied in part
    on Rule 73. The appellant argues that he was wrong to do so because its application
    is limited to judgments that can be registered under <i>REJUKA </i> and these
    must be judgments that make payable a sum of money. The U.K. order of December
    20, 2004 is clearly not that.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I

line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his reasons of February 21, 2005, Farley J. focused much more on Part V Article
    VIII as the provision that permitted <i>REJUKA</i> to serve as a basis for
    his recognition order. The appellant contests this for two reasons: (a) Cavell
    did not serve it with the originating process in the U.K. court that led
    to the December 20 order; and (b) that order is not a final order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again
    I agree with the appellant. Under Part V Article VIII, Cavell is entitled
    to an order recognizing the U.K. order of December 20 if that order could
    be registered under <i>REJUKA</i>, had it been a judgment for the payment
    of a sum of money. Part IV Article VI s. 4(c) together with Rule 73 require
    that for a money judgment to be registered, Cavell would have to show proof
    of service on the appellant of the originating process in the U.K. court.
    There was no such service, and hence if the U.K. order of December 20 had
    been a judgment for the payment of money it could not have been registered
    under <i>REJUKA</i>. Even if the Ontario court could be said to have a discretion
    to dispense with this service, Farley J. made no finding that he would have
    done so had this been a money judgment. The respondent’s inability to prove
    service thus bars the recognition of the U.K. order of December 20 under
    Article VIII of the Convention and <i>REJUKA</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    well, I think Article VIII requires a judgment to be final and conclusive
    before it can be recognized under that Article. Article VIII provides that
    where a judgment is recognized thereunder, it is “recognized in a court of
    the other contracting state as <u>conclusive</u> between the parties thereto
    in all proceedings founded on the same cause of action” (emphasis added).
    It would be illogical if the Convention required a judgment that was not
    final and therefore conclusive in the issuing state to be treated as conclusive
    in the other state. Rather, I conclude that a judgment must be final in the
    issuing  state to be recognized under Article VIII. All agree that the U.K.
    order of December 20, 2004 was not a final order for this purpose. For this
    reason as well it could not be recognized under Article VIII. </p>

    consideration of the recognition and enforcement of a foreign judgment pursuant
    to the rules of private international law must begin with the groundbreaking
    judgment in  <i>Morguard Investments Ltd. v. De Savoye</i>, [1990] 3 S.C.R.
    1077. Speaking for the Court, LaForest J. recognized the pressing need to
    modernize these rules to accommodate the increasingly transnational nature
    of commercial transactions that accompanies the inexorable evolution towards
    a global economy. He put it this way at p. 1098:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The business
    community operates in a world economy and we correctly speak of a world community
    even in the face of decentralized political and legal power. Accommodating
    the flow of wealth, skills and people across state lines has now become imperative.
    Under these circumstances, our approach to the recognition and enforcement
    of foreign judgments would appear ripe for reappraisal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Of
    central importance in this task of reappraisal is the doctrine of comity,
    a doctrine “grounded in the need in modern times to facilitate the flow of
    wealth, skills and people across state lines in a fair and orderly manner”.
    See <i>Morguard, supra</i>, at p. 1096. At the same page, the doctrine was
    defined as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>“Comity” in
    the legal sense, is neither a matter of absolute obligation, on the one hand,
    nor of mere courtesy and good will, upon the other. But it is the recognition
    which one nation allows within its territory to the legislative, executive
    or judicial acts of another nation, having due regard both to international
    duty and convenience, and to the rights of its own citizens or of other persons
    who are under the protection of its laws …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>LaForest
    J. went on to identify the principles of “real and substantial connection” and “order
    and fairness” as fundamental considerations for a court to properly determine
    whether to recognize a foreign judgment pursuant to private international
    law. These principles allow the domestic court to assess whether the foreign
    court took jurisdiction and issued the judgment in a way that the domestic
    court should recognize. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first of these, the real and substantial connection principle, is now clearly
    applicable both to the recognition of foreign judgments and interprovincial
    judgments. This was established in <i>Beals v. Saldanha</i>, [2003] 3 S.C.R.
    416 where, at p. 436, the Court made it clear that “the need to accommodate ‘the
    flow of wealth skills and people across state lines’ is as much an imperative
    internationally as it is interprovincially.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second principle, order and fairness, recognizes the importance of both the
    security of international transactions and as well the need for fairness
    to those against whom recognition and enforcement is sought, and the need
    to balance the two.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Traditionally,
    to recognize and enforce a foreign judgment in Ontario, the court has required
    that it be both a final judgment and for a definite sum of money. In this
    proceeding, while the appellant argues the finality requirement, it does
    not raise as an issue the fact that the foreign judgment, the U.K. order
    of December 20, 2004, is not for a fixed sum of money. The appellant appears
    to accept the need, in the modern world of international commerce, to revisit
    this requirement. This need has been recognized by Castel and Walker in <i>Canadian
    Conflict of Laws</i>, 5<sup>th</sup> ed. at 14-21 and by this court <i>in
    obiter</i> in <i>Pro Swing Inc. v. ELTA Golf  Inc. </i>(2004), 71 O.R. (3d)
    566 at 570. It should be noted that this judgment has been appealed to the
    Supreme Court of Canada which reserved its decision on December 15, 2005.
    Because this issue has not been argued by the appellant here, and because
    of the views expressed by this court in <i>Pro Swing</i>, <i>supra</i>, I
    will proceed on the basis that the non-monetary nature of the U.K. order
    of December 20 is not an impediment to its recognition in Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the appellant does assert that Farley J. erred by recognizing a foreign order
    that is not final, although it would appear that this argument was not put
    to him and he did not deal with it in his reasons. <i>Four Embarcadero Center
    Venture et al. v. Kalen et al. </i>(1988), 65 O.R. (2d) 551 is a frequently
    cited articulation of this requirement where Henry J. said this at p. 563:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The foreign
    money judgment must be final and <i>res judicata</i> in the foreign jurisdiction.
    This occurs when the judgment of the foreign court is final in the sense
    that the court that made it no longer has the power to rescind or vary it[.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Such
    a requirement serves at least three purposes. First, the domestic court knows
    precisely what it is agreeing to recognize and enforce. The importance of
    the foreign judgment being clear and certain was emphasized by this court
    in <i>Pro Swing</i>, <i>supra</i>. Second, finality removes the risk of the
    injustice that would be done to the party against whom the foreign order
    is enforced if that order is subsequently changed. This is particularly germane
    where the foreign order is for the payment of money. Third, finality removes
    the risk of undermining public confidence that might arise if the domestic
    court were to issue a recognition order and permit its enforcement, only
    to have the foundation of that order, namely the foreign order, disappear.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, if the U.K. order of December 20, 2004 is recognized, each of these
    purposes will nonetheless be served. That order obviously does not finally
    decide the substantive issue affecting the appellant and the respondent Cavell,
    because it does not approve the scheme of arrangement. It merely commences
    the procedure which may lead to the U.K. court ultimately doing so. There
    is no doubt that subsequent orders of the U.K. court may affect the course
    of that court procedure. However the initiating order of December 20 is undoubtedly
    clear and certain. The meeting, its location and the notice requirements
    for it are clearly spelled out. Thus the Ontario court knows what it is recognizing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    recognition of the U.K. order presents little if any risk of injustice to
    the appellant. The order does not require the appellant to pay money, or
    indeed to do anything. If it is subsequently amended, even to the point of
    cancelling the meeting altogether, this does not infringe on the appellant
    in any meaningful way. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    because of the nature of the order and the terms of its recognition, I think
    there is little risk of undermining public confidence if the procedure initiated
    by the U.K. order is changed following its recognition by the Ontario court.
    The U.K. order merely commences a procedure that is supervised by that court.
    It would be unsurprising for that court to issue subsequent orders providing
    further guidance for that procedure. Moreover, a term of the recognition
    order is that the Ontario court must be kept advised of any such changes
    and that Cavell must seek such further orders of the Ontario Court as are
    necessary as a result. The Ontario court is therefore not put in the position
    of issuing a recognition order whose foreign foundation may disappear.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    not only can recognition of the U.K. order of December 20 satisfy the purposes
    served by finality but there are also strong policy reasons for doing so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    doctrine of comity is well served by an Ontario recognition order. The U.K.
    court has long been accorded respect in this jurisdiction and the statutory
    process it initiated with the December 20 order is one familiar to the courts
    of Ontario. Various pieces of commercial legislation in this province provide
    for analogous procedures. In each case, it is important that parties ultimately
    affected by the scheme be permitted to participate effectively from the beginning.
    A recognition order facilitates this where, as here, the statutory procedure
    must reach across national boundaries.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    related notion of reciprocity is also well served by a recognition order.
    Each of the <i>Canada Business Corporations Act </i>and the Ontario<i> Business
    Corporations Act</i> provide court procedures for the approval of solvent
    schemes of arrangement. If<i> </i>an Ontario court were administering such
    a scheme, and it affected interests in the United Kingdom, the court would
    hope for the same recognition of its orders as is sought in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, fairness to those who are to be affected by recognition is enhanced
    rather than diminished if the Ontario recognition order is granted. The conditions
    attached to the recognition order such as the added notice provisions and
    the required video link make participation in the U.K. statutory procedure
    by the appellant and others in the same position that much easier. Put another
    way, if a recognition order were denied at this stage, an attempt to recognize
    any U.K. order finally approving the scheme of arrangement might be met with
    a complaint that those in Canada affected by the final order were afforded
    no satisfactory way to participate in the U.K. process leading to that order.
    The recognition order avoids that risk.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    conditions of the recognition order that entitle an affected party to come
    back to the Ontario court to seek the further assistance of the court and
    that require the U.K. evaluator to reach a commutation value based on the
    OSFI rules also serve the objective of fairness to those affected by the
    order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    recognize that because of the conditions attached to it, the recognition
    order of December 21, 2004, does not just recognize the U.K. order of December
    20. It also in effect declares that the Ontario court accepts the jurisdiction
    of the U.K. court to carry on the statutory procedure authorized by s. 425
    of the U.K. <i>Companies Act, 1985</i> and provides that the Ontario court
    will co-ordinate with and support that procedure to the extent it affects
    interests in Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Clearly
    this result could have been achieved by domestic legislation as it has been
    in both the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i> and the <i>Companies’ Creditors
    Arrangement Act</i> for foreign proceedings brought under bankruptcy or insolvency
    legislation. Neither Act applies to this circumstance, because of the legislation
    used in the U.K.</p>

line-height:normal;'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    in an age where the rules of private international law are evolving to accommodate
    the increasingly transnational nature of commerce, I see no reason why this
    result should be precluded by those rules just because the foreign order
    to be recognized is not final. In my view the want of finality carries with
    it no substantive effect that should deny recognition. I would therefore
    conclude that the appellant’s finality argument fails. </p>

line-height:normal;'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s second argument is that the U.K. order of December 20, 2004,
    ought not to have been recognized because the appellant was not served with
    the originating papers in the U.K. and did not appear or otherwise submit
    to the jurisdiction of the U.K. court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, this argument must also fail. There is no doubt that the appellant
    was not served with notice of the December 20 proceeding. However, whether
    that is viewed as bearing upon the jurisdiction of the U.K. court to issue
    the order (as in <i>Currie v. McDonald’s Restaurants of Canada Ltd. </i>(2005),
    74 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.)) or as bearing upon natural justice and therefore
    raising a possible defence to the enforcement of the U.K. order (as in <i>Beals</i>, <i>supra</i>),
    the ultimate question is whether in the circumstances the appellant has been
    accorded a fair process. </p>

    J. answered that question in the affirmative and I see no basis to interfere
    with his finding. As my colleague, Sharpe J.A., said about the analogous
    finding in <i>Currie</i>, <i>supra</i>, it is essentially a finding of fact
    that is entitled to deference in this court. Moreover, in the circumstances,
    it is entirely reasonable. The appellant was alerted by letter in mid-November
    that Cavell was proposing to proceed by way of a scheme of arrangement, but
    it does not appear to have sought further details. It was also served with
    the full application record for the proceedings before Farley J. but chose
    not to appear. The order in the proceeding of which the appellant says it
    received no notice, namely the U.K. order of December 20, merely initiates
    the statutory procedure in the U.K. court in which the appellant will have
    the full opportunity to participate before its rights are determined. Given
    the letter notification given to the appellant, the nature of the order made,
    and the appellant’s right to be heard in the U.K. proceeding when it matters,
    I find entirely reasonable the conclusion that the appellant received a fair
    process.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    argument can be disposed of briefly. Farley J. found a connection between
    the U.K. jurisdiction and the subject matter of the proceedings that was
    sufficient to meet the test. I agree. The subject matter is a scheme of arrangement
    proposed by a U.K. company under U.K. legislation. It would affect all the
    creditors of the company, only a small percentage of which are in Canada.
    The meeting authorized by the December 20 order will take place in the U.K.
    It is not required that there be any particular linkage with those like the
    appellant who may be among those worldwide to be affected by the proceedings.
    All this, in my view, is more than enough to warrant rejection of this argument.</p>

    U.K. order of the December 20, 2004 must fail.<b>Third Issue : Removal of the Right to Appeal to the Ontario Court  </p>

    his reasons of February 21, 2005, Farley J. added a condition to his recognition
    order of December 21, 2004. That condition gave a right of appeal “to this
    court” concerning the evaluation, using OSFI rules, of the commuted value
    of the claims of Canadian creditors of Cavell. Those reasons recite Farley
    J.’s  concern about the absence from the scheme of arrangement of a meaningful
    right of appeal from these evaluations. The reasons say nothing about why
    this should be to the Ontario court rather than the U.K. court.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    asked to settle the terms of the order flowing from his reasons, Farley J.
    released a further brief endorsement on April 22, 2005. He said that his
    primary concern was the right of appeal, and that the question of the appeal
    being heard “in the Ontario court” was “a very peripheral point”. He made
    it clear that the draft order providing for the appeal to go to the U.K.
    court captured his true intention. It also avoided the risk that if the reference
    to the Ontario court remained, his order would determine whether the Canadian
    creditors should constitute a separate class for voting on the scheme of
    arrangement, something which was not his intention and which was clearly
    a question for the U.K. court. He therefore approved the draft order as presented
    by Cavell.</p>

    appellant, supported by the respondent Reliance Insurance Company, a second
    Canadian creditor of Cavell, argues that Farley J. erred in making this change.
    I disagree. In my view, it was entirely within his discretion to make the
    clarification of April 22, 2005. The order from the February hearing had
    not yet been issued. The draft order as he approved it captures his fundamental
    intention. The change in court was peripheral to that intention and was necessary
    to avoid an outcome he did not intend. By proceeding as he did, Farley J.
    ensured that the order reflected his true decision. He had the discretion
    to do so.</p>
