style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regrettably,
    this appeal relates to a serious accident that took place almost 12&nbsp;years
    ago, on December 1, 1994.  The insured person, the appellant Jerry Cervo,
    applied for no&#8209;fault accident benefits.  The insurance company, the
    respondent State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (“State Farm”),
    denied his claim on the basis that he had not notified State Farm of his
    claim within 30&nbsp;days after the accident, as required by s.&nbsp;59(1)
    of the <i>Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule</i>, Ont. Reg. 776/93 ( the “<i>SABS</i>”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cervo
    took the position that strict compliance with this limitation period was
    not required in the circumstances of his case.  He relied on s.&nbsp;59(4)
    of the <i>SABS</i> which provides that a failure to comply with the time
    limit in s.&nbsp;59(1) does not disentitle a person to benefits if the person
    has “a reasonable excuse” for non&#8209;compliance.  Cervo also relied on
    the more general relief provision in s.&nbsp;129 of the <i>Insurance Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;8, which permits a court to grant relief if
    the court “considers it inequitable that the insurance should be forfeited”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    matter came before Low&nbsp;J. as a Rule&nbsp;22 motion for the determination
    of two questions:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1) Whether the plaintiff Jerry Cervo had a reasonable
    excuse for his failure to apply in timely fashion for benefits under the
    Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule under the <i>Insurance Act</i>;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) If he did not, is this an appropriate case
    for relief from forfeiture under s.&nbsp;129 of the <i>Insurance Act</i>?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge answered both questions in the negative.  The appellant Cervo
    and the appellant Joseph Raimondo, who was Cervo’s lawyer, appeal the motion
    judge’s decision.</p>

      it is not at all clear that this issue was raised before the motion judge,

      in effect a code in the domain of relief from forfeiture for </span><i><span lang=EN-US>SABS</span></i><span lang=EN-US> benefits,

lang=EN-US> of the late application for both the claimant (hardship) and the
    insurance company (prejudice).  This fundamental difference in focus tells
    strongly against the submission that s.&nbsp;59(4) of the </span><i><span lang=EN-US>SABS</span></i><span lang=EN-US> occupies
    the field, thus rendering s.&nbsp;129 of the</span><i><span lang=EN-US> Insurance

      a case involving the failure of one insurance company to notify another
      insurance company about a claim within a statutory time frame.  Different
      considerations apply to claimants whose knowledge of the complexities and

      at the same level as the knowledge of the companies involved in the industry.  In
      any event, </span><i><span lang=EN-US>Kingsway</span></i><span lang=EN-US> is

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Although the onus remains on the plaintiffs to

'><span lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
      the motion judge found that the solicitor was the agent of the client and
      that as far as third parties were concerned, the actions of a solicitor
      are the actions of the principal where the actions are taken in the course
      of dealing with the client’s case. The motion judge relied on arbitral
      jurisprudence that mere reliance on counsel cannot serve as an excuse:
      see </span><i><span lang=EN-US>Barry Carruthers and Royal &amp; SunAlliance
      Insurance Company of Canada </span></i><span lang=EN-US> (FSCO A99 – 000923,

'><span lang=EN-US>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>An
      attempt was made to distinguish the status of the client from the status
      of the solicitor.  It was argued that because Cervo was 19 years of age,
      lived at home with his parents, had a Grade 11 education and worked as
      a labourer, these characteristics would somehow constitute a valid excuse
      for the failure to give notice.  However, the solicitor was not hampered
      by any of these alleged limitations.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

        v. Paletta </span></i><span lang=EN-US>[1966] 2 O.R. 524 at 526-27, this
        court confirmed the relationship of solicitor and client when it stated:  </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>In general, the solicitor is the client's authorized agent in all matters that
      may reasonably be expected to arise for decision in the particular proceedings
      for which he has been retained. Where a principal gives an agent general
      authority to conduct any business on his behalf, he is bound as regards
      third persons by every act done by the agent which is incidental to the
      ordinary course of such business or which falls within the apparent scope
      of the agent's authority. </span></p>

      the present case there was no evidence of any limitation between the client
      and the solicitor or on the solicitor’s authority to act for his client.  I
      agree with the motion judge that mere reliance on the solicitor was not
      a reasonable excuse. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Forklift as an Automobile</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
      the motion judge found, correctly in my view, that during the time the  notice
      should have been given, the existing jurisprudence was such that a claimant
      in Cervo’s position would reasonably have believed he had been in an automobile
      accident which would give rise to accident benefits.  The motion judge
      noted that it was long after the period during which the claimant could
      have given notice of his claim for accident benefits that this court decided
      in </span><i><span lang=EN-US>Regele v. Slusarczyk</span></i><span lang=EN-US> (1997),
      33 O.R. (3d) 556 that a tractor (by analogy a forklift) was not an automobile.  Accordingly,
      the motion judge concluded that the question of whether the forklift was
      an automobile was not a reasonable excuse. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      any event, although this point was not mentioned by the motion judge, but
      argued by counsel for State Farm, there could not be any doubt that the
      van involved in the accident was an automobile as defined under the Act,
      thus giving rise to a claim for accident benefits.  There was no logical
      reason to fixate on the meaning of the forklift when the van was involved
      in the accident and was clearly an automobile.  Though the van was stationary
      at the time of the accident, there was case law in 1994 that strongly suggested
      a parked van would be considered an automobile and that the accident arose
      from the use or operation of the vehicle: </span><i><span
lang=EN-US>Omand v. Disabled &amp; Aged Regional Transit Systems </span></i><span lang=EN-US>(1993),
      14 O.R. (3d) 52 (Ont. Ct. Gen. Div.); </span><i><span lang=EN-US>Boell
      v. Schinkel </span></i><span lang=EN-US>(1991), 3 O.R. (3d) 741 (Ont. Ct.
      Gen. Div.).</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Complexity</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third,
      the motion judge rejected the argument that the complexity of the matter
      requiring a second opinion (whether Cervo’s tort rights would be affected
      by applying for accident benefits) was a reasonable excuse for the delay
      in giving notice until the end of November of 1996.  I have difficulty
      accepting that, when a solicitor is in doubt regarding the validity of
      his client’s claim and thus seeks the opinion of another, this should constitute
      a reasonable excuse for the delay involved.  More importantly in this case,
      no opinion was sought until January of 1996, long after an opinion could
      have been sought and obtained had Cervo and/or his solicitor acted with
      reasonable dilligence.  There is no explanation why the second opinion
      was not and could not have been sought shortly after the accident.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    last two excuses lose all merit in light of the evidence that there was no
    disadvantage to Cervo in applying for the benefits immediately after the
    accident took place.  The appellants claim they were concerned at the time
    that the forklift would not be considered an automobile and that Cervo’s
    tort rights might be affected by applying for accident benefits, but offered
    no valid reason for not providing any notice at all for almost two years;
    for example, the appellants provided no evidence of anything of a medical
    nature, physical or emotional, or a practical impediment, inadvertence or
    ignorance of the obligation to give notice that might have explained the
    failure to provide timely notice of the accident.  As far as the motion judge
    was concerned, the appellants knew of the obligation to provide notice of
    the accident and chose not to.  </p>

  <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>that

'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>That

      request was made?  </span></p>

'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>That

      benefits was being advanced) until two days before the second anniversary
      of the accident?  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This
      questionable behaviour was carried out in the face of a clear statutory
      requirement to notify the insurer within thirty days of the accident and
      each piece of conduct – or lack thereof – is inexcusable.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      motion judge canvassed every excuse advanced for the delay.  On any reasonable
      interpretation of
    “reasonable excuse”, interpreted in a broad and liberal manner, in my opinion,
    the motion judge was correct in her conclusion that no reasonable excuse
    had been advanced for the failure to apply in a timely fashion for the benefits.  To
    hold otherwise would render the section meaningless.</span></p>

    it was intended to render nugatory the more general relief from forfeiture
    provided in s. 129.  Had that been the intention of the Legislature, it could

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>[50] Part of the transcript of the examination for discovery of a representative
      of State Farm was made part of the motion record. The answers given by
      the State Farm representative disclose the existence of prejudice to the
      insurer arising from the delay in notice. The prejudice is said to lie
      in not being able to investigate the claim properly, not being able to
      speak to witnesses at an early date, not being able to get medical examinations
      at an early date and not being in a position to have assisted plaintiff
      with treatment. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>[51] Plaintiff has adduced no evidence as to hardship. It is nevertheless obvious
      that if relief from forfeiture is not granted, the plaintiff will have
      to look to the defendants in the other actions he has commenced. It is
      said on behalf of the plaintiff that while he has recourse against the
      tortfeasor and against his own lawyer for professional negligence, there
      is no assurance that he will be fully compensated. I agree that there are
      no absolute assurances in any litigation, but hardship to the plaintiff
      exists on a continuum from no prejudice at one end to overwhelming and
      irremediable hardship at the other. In my view, hardship to this plaintiff
      consists of the risks in his action against his solicitor. The pleadings
      in that action were before me. The solicitor's statement of defence does
      not reveal a reasonable explanation for the failure to give timely notice.
      Nor does it reveal a reasonable explanation for the long delay in seeking
      a second opinion if one was necessary. While there are risks to the plaintiff,
      they do not, in my view amount to substantial hardship in the circumstances. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>[52] On the other hand, there is evidence of prejudice to the defendant State
      Farm. The passage of time in itself will cause prejudice because injury
      and recovery are dynamic. The condition of the injured person changes from
      week to week and month to month. Loss of an opportunity to conduct early
      examinations may not be remediable. Loss of the opportunity to provide
      therapeutic interventions may negatively impact on recovery. Here, no evidence
      has been adduced to suggest that there is a remedy for loss of those opportunities. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>[53] Weighing the
      conduct of the plaintiff in refraining from giving notice of his claim,
      the absence of substantial hardship to the plaintiff, the existence of
      prejudice to the defendant and the absence of conduct on the part of the
      defendant that could be said to be objectionable, I am not of the opinion
      that it would be inequitable that the loss be permitted to lie where it
      falls and the insurance benefits be avoided in these circumstances.<u></u></span></p>

    she knew the result of her decision not to relieve from forfeiture: Cervo
    would not receive benefits and would have to look to the defendants in the
    other actions.  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    referring to the prejudice to State Farm, the motion judge found that the
    evidence of a State Farm representative, given on the cross-examination of
    his affidavit, disclosed prejudice arising from the delay in giving notice.  In
    particular, prejudice arose from not being able to speak to witnesses and
    evaluate the claim at an early stage.  Furthermore, as the condition of an
    injured claimant can change from week to week and month to month, there was
    a loss of opportunity to assist the claimant with treatment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    reject the argument of the appellants that this evidence was nothing but
    bald statements.  In my view, they are common sense observations properly
    considered by the motion judge in declining to relieve from forfeiture.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge also added – I presume having in mind that the onus was on the
    person seeking the relief from forfeiture – that no evidence had been adduced
    that there was a remedy for the loss of those opportunities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    reviewing the potential prejudice to State Farm, as testified to by its representative
    and reviewed above in the reasons of the trial judge, my colleague concludes
    that the record put forward by State Farm does not support a finding of strong
    prejudice.  He relies upon the decision of this court in <i>Chiarelli v.
    Wiens</i>, <i>supra</i>, as authority for the view that the insurer is required
    to provide concrete evidence of how it had been prejudiced from taking any
    medical or legal steps that it may have wanted to take.  However, there are
    important differences between this case and <i>Chiarelli</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, <i>Chiarelli </i>concerned
    extending the time for service of a statement of claim and the possible prejudice
    that might be suffered by an insurance company (State Farm) if the time for
    service was extended.  In contrast, the case before this court<i> </i>concerns
    a thirty-day limitation period for notification to an insurer after an accident.  More
    specifically, it concerns whether Cervo had a “reasonable excuse” for his
    failure to apply in timely fashion for benefits under the SABS and, if he
    did not, whether this is an appropriate case for relief from forfeiture under
    s. 129 of the Act.  While both cases consider the issue of prejudice to the
    insurer, the contexts are different: extension of the time for service (being
    two years) in <i>Chiarelli </i>and a statutory limitation period (being 30
    days) for notification of the accident in this case.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    in <i>Chiarelli</i>, the plaintiffs notified their insurer <b><i><u>immediately</u></i></b> of
    the claim and kept the insurer up-to-date.  The plaintiffs retained a lawyer
    soon after the October accident and by the end of November had put State
    Farm on notice of a claim. When one of the plaintiffs’ medical condition
    deteriorated, the plaintiffs’ lawyer forwarded medical information to State
    Farm as the information became available.  In contrast, in this case, though
    Cervo retained a lawyer very quickly, State Farm was not notified of a claim
    until almost two years after the accident occurred, well beyond the thirty-day
    limitation period.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    in <i>Chiarelli</i>, the Court concluded that State Farm was not prejudiced
    by the long delay in serving the statement of claim.  State Farm failed to
    act when it knew that the injury to the plaintiff was serious; this was not
    caused by delay in serving the statement of claim.  The insurer had the opportunity
    to do something about the injury to the plaintiff, but did not.  The Court
    held that the insurer could not create prejudice by its failure to do something
    that it reasonably could have done or ought to have done.  In contrast, in
    this case, the insurer was given no opportunity to examine or help Cervo
    because it had not been notified of his claim.  Unlike the insurer in <i>Chiarelli</i>,
    it was not given the information to make the choice of whether to examine
    and assist Cervo’s recovery or not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    the limitation periods at issue in <i>Chiarelli </i>and this case are very
    different.  The two-year period at issue in <i>Chiarelli </i>concerns the
    period within which a statement of claim must be served.  The limitation
    period at issue in this case is the thirty days that are given for an accident
    victim to notify his or her insurer of the accident.   </p>

      J.A. spoke in relation to the facts before him. Those facts are so different
      from the present case that the legal analysis is of limited application.  However,
      I would adopt the part of the passage quoted by MacPherson J.A. in which
      Laskin J.A. states that the onus remains on the plaintiff to show that
      the defendant will not be prejudiced by an extension of time.  Indeed,
      it is important to emphasize that in the case of relief against forfeiture,
      the onus is on the insured to show that the insurer suffered no prejudice
      as a result of the breach: </span><i><span

      less clear evidence – of hardship to himself or lack of prejudice to State
      Farm.  </span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

      the defendant that could be said to be objectionable, I am not of the opinion
      that it would be inequitable that the loss be permitted to lie where it
      falls and the insurance benefits be avoided in these circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>At para. 21, my
      colleague states:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;
