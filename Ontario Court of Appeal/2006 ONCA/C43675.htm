  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the conviction
      entered and the sentence imposed by Justice Clair Marchand of the Superior
      Court of Justice on May 18, 2005.</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was convicted by a judge and jury on one count of extortion contrary
    to s. 346(1.1)(b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  He initially appealed his
    conviction and sentence.  He has now abandoned his conviction appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    allegation was that the appellant had left a voice mail message demanding
    that Mr. Mitch Engel, a defence lawyer who had earlier refused to act for
    the appellant, pay him $1,000 on threat of death to Mr. Engel and his family.  The
    message left was as follows: “Mitch, this is Adam Lock.  I am in Kingston
    Penitentiary.  I want you to send me $1,000.  If you don’t, I will have someone
    kill you and hurt your family.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was sentenced to six years imprisonment and a lifetime firearms
    prohibition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    principal issue at trial was identity.  At trial, the Crown adduced similar
    act evidence in the form of two previous acts of extortion committed by the
    appellant in respect of two different lawyers who had represented him in
    the past.  The appellant pleaded guilty to those offences and was sentenced
    to one-year imprisonment on each offence to run concurrently.  The Crown
    also adduced other evidence including evidence identifying the voice on the
    message as that of the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that his sentence is outside the appropriate range of sentences
    for this offence and this offender.  Despite the fact that the appellant
    had two previous convictions for extortion against lawyers, the nature of
    the threat and the case law would suggest a substantially lower sentence
    than the six years imposed.  He also argues that the trial judge improperly
    considered s. 423.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> in sentencing despite the
    fact that he was not charged under that section.  Further, the requirement
    in that section that the defendant intend to impede the victim in the performance
    of his duties was never an issue at trial.  The appellant submits that on
    these facts the appropriate range for the offence is two to four years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown submits that the appellant has a long and unenviable record and that
    the present offence was committed while he was serving a sentence for similar
    extortion offences and the sentence imposed is appropriate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the sentence imposed was outside of the appropriate range.  A number
    of cases relied on by the trial judge as being relevant to the length of
    sentence were really quite different from the instant offence as they involved
    counselling murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    present case involves one event where the appellant sought to extort $1,000
    on threat of death to the victim and his family.  Without minimizing the
    seriousness of the offence and the significance of the appellant’s record
    including convictions for similar conduct, when the circumstances of this
    case are considered an appropriate sentence is four years. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    conclusion, the conviction appeal is dismissed as abandoned, leave to appeal
    sentence is granted, the sentence appeal is allowed and the sentence is varied
    from six years to four years.  The lifetime firearms prohibition remains.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the sake of clarity, we note that there is no indication in the trial judge’s
    endorsement and reasons to the effect that this sentence was to be served
    consecutively to sentences the appellant was already serving.  Absent any
    such indication, the sentence is deemed to run concurrently.</p>
