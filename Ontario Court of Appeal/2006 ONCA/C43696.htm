  <p><b>On appeal from order of </b><b>Justice Terrance P. O'Connor of the Superior
      Court of Justice dated November 17, 2004.</b></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>BY THE COURT:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, Norma Sandaluck, appeals the judgment of O’Connor&nbsp;J. dated
    November&nbsp;17,&nbsp;2004.  At the conclusion of a long trial, he ordered
    that the parents (Ms.&nbsp;Sandaluck and Miles&nbsp;Roy) have “shared parenting” of
    their two children and share most parenting responsibilities.  The trial
    judge called this “the equal sharing parenting plan approach.”  A central
    feature of the plan was that the parents would spend equal time with their
    children.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also dealt with a large number of other issues, including child
    support, spousal support, the sale of the matrimonial home and the appointment
    of a parenting co&#8209;ordinator to assist the parents in resolving disputes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are of the view that the “shared parenting” component of the trial judge’s
    order cannot stand. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court of Canada and this court have consistently held that joint
    or parallel custody should only be ordered where the parents can co&#8209;operate
    and communicate effectively: see, for example, <i>Young v. Young</i>, [1993]
    4 S.C.R. 3 at para.&nbsp;44; <i>Kaplanis v. Kaplanis</i>, [2005] O.J. No.
    275 at 4 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    basis for the trial judge’s order of shared parenting was the recommendation
    of Mary&nbsp;Satterfield, a mediator who worked long and hard, but ultimately
    unsuccessfully, to resolve the parties’ disagreements after being appointed
    by the trial judge following 12&nbsp;days of evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately,
    virtually the entire record – interim proceedings before another judge, the
    mediator’s own description of the parties’ relationship, the trial judge’s
    own comments during the trial and his observations in the judgment, and the
    fresh evidence filed by both parties –
    establishes that a foundation for a joint or parallel custody order set out
    in the case law, namely co&#8209;operation and effective communication, has
    been and continues to be entirely missing from this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her interim order granting the appellant sole custody of the children, Templeton&nbsp;J.
    stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the circumstances of the apparently complete
    communication breakdown between the parties, the open discord and the history
    of substantial instability in the parties’ relationship over a number of
    years, joint custody would not be in the best interests of the children.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mary&nbsp;Satterfield,
    the court&#8209;appointed mediator, testified that the respondent told her
    that “he doesn’t want to have anything to do with [the appellant]…he wouldn’t
    give [her] the time of day.”  She also testified that the parties have a
    “horrendous mistrust” of each other.  Moreover, in her report to the judge,
    after 10 mediation sessions with the parties, she stated: “[W]e have been
    unable to obtain agreement about a parenting plan.  We are not even close.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the trial, the trial judge observed: “[T]here is a horrible rift between
    you in terms of communication.  You are simply unable to trust each other
    and communicate to each other so that you can jointly parent these kids.”  In
    his judgment, he referred to “the enormous antipathy and mistrust that pervades
    their relationship.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fresh evidence filed by both parties does not relieve this bleak picture.  Indeed,
    it is filled, on both sides, with accusations and recriminations and is virtually
    silent about the children and their best interests.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    light of this record, a shared parenting order was, with respect, inappropriate
    in November&nbsp;2004, and remains so today.  The respondent does not assert
    that he should be granted sole custody of the children and the record amply
    supports the appellant as sole custody parent if a choice is required.  Accordingly,
    we order that the appellant have sole custody of the children.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    on all other issues, the trial judge’s order is in the best interests of
    the children and should be maintained.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that the equal time the children spend with their parents
    should be overturned and that the respondent’s access should be limited to
    that set out in Templeton&nbsp;J.’s interim order (every second week&#8209;end
    and one three&#8209;hour period on one weekday evening each week).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree.  The record amply supports the trial judge’s conclusion that “[i]t
    is in the children’s best interest that they spend more or less equal time
    with each parent.”  His conclusion is also consistent with s.&nbsp;16(10)
    of the <i>Divorce Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, C.&nbsp;3, which enunciates “the
    principle that a child of the marriage should have as much contact with each
    spouse as is consistent with the best interests of the child…”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant seeks an increase in child support payments.  However, this request
    is dependent on a revision in the distribution of time the children will
    spend with each parent.  Accordingly, this component of the appeal must fail
    as well.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is allowed on the shared parenting issue.  The appellant shall be
    the sole custodial parent with power to make all major decisions concerning
    the children, including decisions relating to place of residence, schooling,
    religion and medical treatment.  The trial judge’s order is modified in accordance
    with this disposition.  We note that the access regime set out in paragraphs
    1 and 2 of the trial judge’s order should continue, but under the heading “Equal
    Access” replacing “Shared Parenting” and with this introductory sentence: “The
    children are to spend equal time with their mother and father as set out
    in the following access plan.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    light of partial success, the appellant is entitled to a costs recovery which
    we fix at $10,000 inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
