    447.25 of the <i>Municipal Act</i>, R.S.O., c. M.45, as amended by S.O. 1998,
    c.&nbsp;3, s. 30 of the <i>Municipal Act</i>, 2001, S.O. 2001, c.C.5 (now
    s. 333), first enacted in 1998, authorizes a commercial landlord to collect
    municipal realty taxes from a tenant beyond what is stipulated in the lease
    in order to recoup any “shortfall” in the landlord’s taxes for any given
    year. At issue in this case is whether the landlord’s power under this section
    was correctly exercised in accordance with the statute.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1998, Omers Realty Corporation (the “landlord”) asked some of its eligible
    tenants in the Stone Road Mall (the “mall”) – but not all – to each make
    an additional shortfall payment. The amount sought from Sears (a tenant)
    was $189,720. Sears refused to pay on the basis that the landlord’s demand
    was unfair, discriminatory, and unreasonable. Instead, Sears served a notice
    of arbitration on the landlord pursuant to the lease provisions in that behalf.
    An arbitration board ruled in Sears’ favour and ordered the landlord to recover
    its shortfall from all eligible tenants in the mall. According to a majority
    of the board, the legislation imposed on the landlord a “duty of care to
    treat all tenants equitably”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    landlord appealed the board’s decision to a single judge of the Superior
    Court under s. 45 of the <i>Arbitration Act</i>¸ <i>1991</i>, S.O. 1991,
    c. 17. Pepall J. allowed the appeal. She held: (1) the legislation did not
    require a landlord to recover shortfall from all its eligible tenants; and
    (2) since the landlord was exercising a statutory power of decision, the
    decision was entitled to deference and should not be interfered with unless
    it was patently unreasonable, which it was not. The appeal judge set aside
    the arbitration award and allowed the landlord’s decision to stand. Sears
    appeals that decision to this court pursuant to leave granted.</p>

    is an anchor tenant at the mall in Guelph, Ontario. The mall has about 150

    to its Notice of Arbitration served, Sears complained about its apportionment
    of property taxes. It took the position that it had been overbilled for 1998
    taxes in the amount of $189,720. The parties entered into an arbitration
    agreement and Messrs. Sholtack, Galardo and Cowan were appointed arbitrators.
    Further, the parties agreed that any award could be appealed on a question
    of law, fact or mixed fact and law to a single judge of the Superior Court
    of Justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1998, the Province of Ontario enacted legislation designed to reform the
    municipal property tax regime.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a>  Business
    occupancy taxes were abolished and realty taxes for commercial and industrial
    properties were increased to make up for the revenue loss resulting from
    the elimination of the business taxes. Current value assessment (“CVA”) was
    introduced, but mechanisms were required to manage the attendant shifts in
    liability for property taxes in the initial ensuing years. The amendments
    to the <i>Municipal Act</i> provided for a “tax capping and shortfall recovery” regime
    applicable to tenants of commercial and industrial properties. The tenant
    cap limited the amount a landlord could charge a tenant on account of property
    taxes, regardless of any lease provision to the contrary. Therefore, in some
    cases, tenants were not required to pay the full amount of taxes that would
    otherwise be charged pursuant to the terms of their leases. The calculation
    of the cap was based on the amount of the tenant’s tax expense for the previous
    year. The cap only applied to tenants occupying all or a portion of a commercial
    or industrial property pursuant to a lease commencing on or before December
    31, 1997. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    result of the capping legislation was that many commercial landlords were
    faced with “shortfalls”. These reflected amounts that previously had been
    collected under the lease but no longer could be because of the legislative
    caps. A landlord, however, was still required to pay taxes on the full assessed
    value of the property. To remedy this problem, the legislation permitted
    landlords to recover their shortfall from two classes of tenant. The first
    class consisted of tenants whose pre-December 31, 1997 leases provided for
    tax payments that did not reach the legislative cap. These tenants were therefore
    exposed to tax payments that exceeded the amounts stipulated in their leases.
    Their payments, however, could not exceed the legislative cap. These tenants
    are referred to as “protected tenants not at cap”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second class from whom the legislation permitted shortfall recovery consisted
    of tenants with tenancies commencing between January 1 and December 17, 1998.
    This class was not entitled to a cap and was left totally unprotected by
    legislation. These tenants are referred to as “uncapped shortfall tenants”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    amendments came into force on June 11, 1998. Tenants who entered into leases
    after December 17, 1998 were not subject to a cap nor liable to pay any portion
    of the shortfall. Their payment arrangements were governed by the terms of
    their leases. A landlord could only recover shortfall from protected tenants
    not at cap and from uncapped shortfall tenants. The landlord was also free
    to absorb any shortfall itself. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    final 1998 taxes for the mall were $2,951,992. In 1998, the mall had tenants
    who were entitled to a cap and who had reached the cap threshold. Those tenancies
    therefore caused a shortfall of property tax for the landlord. The mall also
    had 31 protected tenants not at cap and 23 uncapped shortfall tenants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    landlord took the position that it had a discretion under the legislation
    to select who should contribute to shortfall from its protected tenants not
    at cap and the uncapped shortfall tenants. It decided to exclude all of the
    latter tenants from any shortfall contribution. Shortfall was therefore allocated
    to and recovered from the protected tenants not at cap. Because this group
    reached the cap threshold, the landlord absorbed  the remaining portion of
    the shortfall .</p>

'><b><u>The Arbitration Board</u></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    majority of the arbitration panel concluded that the shortfall must be distributed
    among all those eligible to contribute. It concluded that the landlord was “obliged
    to treat all tenants equitably” and to use a “reasonable method for allocating
    the shortfall … so that all tenants bear a fair share of the burden”. The
    majority ordered the landlord to recover its shortfall from all eligible
    tenants in the mall.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    dissenting member of the arbitration panel, on the other hand, held that
    when the landlord made a decision to recover its shortfall from only one
    class of tenants, the landlord was exercising a “statutory power of decision”.
    As such, the landlord’s decision was entitled to a high degree of deference.
    In the member’s view, since the landlord’s decision was not
    “patently unreasonable”, there was no basis for interfering with it.</p>

    the Superior Court, the appeal judge agreed with the dissenting member of
    the arbitration board that the landlord was exercising a statutory power
    of decision that was entitled to a high degree of deference. She held that
    there was nothing in the legislation that required a landlord to allocate
    shortfall to all eligible tenants, including uncapped shortfall tenants.
    The legislation conferred on landlords a discretion to recoup shortfall.

    the Legislature, where the tribunal is required by or under such Act or otherwise
    by law to hold or to afford to the parties to the proceeding an opportunity
    for a hearing before making a decision.</p>

    was no statutory requirement for the landlord to hold a hearing before acting
    pursuant to s. 447.25. Nor would there be a common law basis for requiring
    the landlord to hold a hearing given that the landlord has a personal financial  interest
    in determining how the tax capping and shortfall recovery regime applies
    to its tenants. The landlord could not be an impartial decision-maker, as
    required by the rules of procedural fairness, and a court would not impose
    a duty to hold a hearing on the landlord in such circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    authority given to landlords to recoup shortfall is narrowly defined and
    limited by the language of sections 447.24 and 447.25 of the <i>Municipal
    Act</i>. The maximum amount the landlord is entitled to collect is stated,
    those tenants from whom the landlord is entitled to collect shortfall are
    defined as is the extent to which the landlord may collect from each group.
    The only “decision” available to the landlord is whether to collect or not
    and if so, from whom – but only to the extent permitted by the statute.</p>

line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    landlord’s decision does not come within the scope of public law and thus
    is not amenable to judicial review. As Brown and Evans explain, the decision
    in question must come within the scope of public law to engage the prerogative
    remedies that may be obtained by way of judicial review.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a> They go on to explain that, “the paradigm
    of a public body is one that exercises statutory powers in the discharge
    of regulatory or other governmental responsibilities in respect of persons
    with whom it is not in a contractual or other private law relationship.”<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[3]</span></a>  The
    landlord is a private actor whose relationship with the affected tenant is
    formed by private contract. The landlord is not a statutory body, nor is
    it required to serve any broad public interest. Its function is strictly
    commercial rather than regulatory in nature.</p>

    my view, the landlord is not exercising a statutory power of decision when
    it decides to seek shortfall recovery from tenants in the manner permitted
    by the legislation as that term is defined and understood. The  “decision” has
    been made by the legislature in enacting these narrow and specific provisions
    of the <i>Municipal Act</i>. The legislature in enacting these provisions
    has determined that commercial landlords are able to override any lease provisions
    that conflict with the  legislation but only in the manner defined by the
    legislation.</p>

    my view the motions judge erred as did the dissenting member of the arbitration
    panel, when she determined, that the landlord was exercising a statutory
    power of decision.</p>

line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the issue for the arbitration board was one of statutory interpretation.
    Its function was to interpret the legislation and determine whether the landlord’s
    actions were in compliance with the legislative requirement. In this, the
    board was required to be correct. Any appeal from the board’s determination
    raises a question of law, which is to be reviewed on a correctness standard.</p>

    takes the position that the landlord is required to allocate any shortfall
    among <i>all </i>eligible tenants. The landlord, it says, does not enjoy
    a discretion to pick and choose among eligible tenants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal judge determined that there was nothing in the language of the legislation
    that required a landlord to allocate shortfall to all eligible tenants, including
    uncapped shortfall tenants. Sections 447.24(5) and 447.25(1) of the <i>Municipal
    Act</i> both use the term “may” rather than
    “shall” to describe the landlord’s ability to recover taxes in amounts that
    exceed those set out in the tenants’ leases. I agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    the appeal judge observed that the legislation is
    “silent on any requirement to allocate shortfall to all eligible tenants
    and the context of the legislation read as a whole is consistent with the
    absence of such a requirement.” If the legislature had intended to require <i>all </i>eligible
    tenants to contribute to shortfall, it would have expressly said so and it
    did not.</p>

      Bay Co. v. Ontario (Attorney General)</i> (2000), 49 O.R. (3d) 455 (S.C.J.)
      at 469, aff’d (2001), 52 O.R. (3d) 737 (C.A.) the court observed:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[T]he impugned
    provisions were set up to ensure that a landlord was able to recover any
    shortfall which could occur as a result of the tenant caps. A landlord is
    not obligated to recoup the shortfall but is entitled to do so. The scheme
    is not mandatory but rather permissive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sears
    also argues that the legislation does not permit the landlord to discriminate
    against certain tenants. As it argues in its factum:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>39.            Equal
    treatment of similar groups is a fundamental tenet of tax policy. The common
    law doctrine of discrimination prevents municipalities from distinguishing
    between or treating persons differently without specific legislative authority.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>40.            The
    Award states “there is nothing in the legislation to justify discriminatory
    treatment”. Sections 447.24 and 447.25 are unique sections within the <i>Municipal
    Act</i>, an act which defines the ambit of delegated powers to municipalities.
    It is submitted that the intrusion by the capping and shortfall legislation
    on the existing landlord and tenant relationship should initially interfere
    as little as possible in contractual relations, but insofar as such interference
    is required, it should be completed on as objective a basis as possible,
    without arbitrarily increasing the extent to which landlords can pass their
    tax burdens on to tenants. In considering landlord’s discretion, in these
    circumstances, any form of discriminatory treatment should be clearly authorized
    in the enabling section and not implied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    flaw in Sears’ argument in this respect is that it presumes unequal treatment
    between the protected tenants not at cap and the uncapped shortfall tenants,
    solely on the basis that the landlord sought recovery of shortfall from the
    former and not the latter. The evidence belies this argument.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence discloses that the landlord elected not to allocate any shortfall
    to the uncapped shortfall tenants because the amounts these tenants were
    already paying, without any contribution to shortfall, were at or above the
    level of the tax-related obligations of similarly situated tenants in the
    mall. For this reason, the landlord determined that the uncapped shortfall
    tenants already bore a fair share of the mall’s realty taxes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    shortfall provisions constitute statutory intervention with private contract.
    As Archibald J. noted in <i>Hudson’s Bay Co. v. Ontario (A.G.)</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at para. 72, this case concerns “statutory interference with normal market
    and economic forces and the renegotiation of closed private contracts.”  In
    these circumstances, there would need to be clear language in the statute
    to empower a landlord to allocate shortfall to tenants in an arbitrary manner.
    No such language exists in the statutory provisions at issue here.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the manner in which OMERS distributed the shortfall in this case was not
    arbitrary. Pepall J. gave convincing reasons to support this conclusion,
    albeit she did so in the context of considering whether OMERS’
    decision was patently unreasonable. Pepall J. observed (at para. 24):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>As to the Landlord’s
    decision not to charge any shortfall to the uncapped shortfall tenants, its
    evidence was that it elected not to do so given that these tenants generally
    already bore a fair share of the Mall’s realty taxes. The Landlord considered
    that the tax obligations of the uncapped shortfall tenants were in line with
    the final obligations, after shortfall allocation, of other tenants in the
    Mall. Furthermore, its model was consistent with industry practice in the
    shopping centre industry. The exercise of discretion by the Landlord in this
    regard cannot be said to be patently unreasonable or indeed unreasonable.  As  to  the  Landlord’s  methodology,  without </p>
  <br clear=all>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>embarking on
    a detailed discussion of the Landlord’s and Sears’ respective methodologies,
    suffice it to say that Sears’ own expert acknowledged that any methodology
    selected would favour some tenants to the disadvantage of others. There was
    no single methodology that always could be said to be correct.  Not every
    tenant would be satisfied regardless of the methodology used. In addition,
    the witness for Sears appeared to acknowledge that the ratio methodology
    used by Omers and other shopping center landlords was not always inappropriate.
    Sears and the majority took issue with the Landlord’s creation in its methodology
    of an artificial tenant’s cap for uncapped shortfall tenants. The Landlord
    advanced compelling reasons for employing the methodology it did and certainly
    its decision in this regard could be rationally supported ….</p>
