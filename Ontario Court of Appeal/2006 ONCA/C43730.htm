      reasons for judgment and the reasons for sentence are inadequate.  The
      accused and the community deserve better.</span></p>

      are satisfied, however, that the sexual assault conviction should be sustained
      despite the inadequacies in the reasons.  We are satisfied based on the
      trial record and the very limited reasons of the trial judge that this
      court can make the basis of the conviction clear to the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>From
      the reasons, it is clear that the trial judge, while accepting the complainant’s
      evidence, was not satisfied that the complainant’s evidence alone could
      support a conviction.  The complainant was eleven years old at trial.  The
      trial judge was satisfied, however, that the appellant’s admission during
      his testimony of an act of fellatio between himself and the complainant
      provided strong confirmation of the complainant’s evidence.  The trial
      judge went on to reject the appellant’s explanation to the effect that
      the nine year old complainant had on her own initiative performed fellatio
      on the appellant while he was asleep and that he stopped her as soon as
      he woke up and saw what was happening.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge found that the appellant’s explanation was “unproven”.  Obviously,
      there was no onus on the appellant to prove anything.  We accept Crown
      counsel’s submission, however, that the use of the word “unproven” must
      be considered along with the accurate statement of the onus of proof appearing
      immediately before the reference to the word “unproven”.  Considering the
      reasons as a whole, we take them as an outright rejection by the trial
      judge of the appellant’s explanation in relation to the act of fellatio.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
      note that counsel for the appellant at trial referred to the appellant’s
      evidence concerning the fellatio as “very bizarre”.  We also note that
      counsel did not rely on this aspect of his client’s own evidence at trial.  In
      the context of the rest of the appellant’s evidence, we are satisfied that
      his explanation that the nine year old complainant committed fellatio while
      he was asleep is simply incapable of belief on any reasonable view of the
      evidence.  Once that explanation is rejected, it follows that the act of
      fellatio amounted to a sexual assault.  That finding provides a basis for
      a conviction of the appellant on the sexual assault charge.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It
      is unclear from the trial judge’s reasons what findings in respect of sexual
      acts other than fellatio the trial judge made against the appellant.  The
      trial judge’s reasons for conviction are internally inconsistent and his
      reasons for sentence contain no insight as to the factual basis upon which
      the trial judge imposed a sentence totalling four years and seven months.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
      would uphold the conviction, but on the basis that the Crown had proved
      beyond a reasonable doubt the single act of fellatio admitted to by the
      appellant in his own testimony.  We do so on the basis that this record
      permits us to totally reject the appellant’s innocent explanation for that
      act.  Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With
      respect to the sentence appeal, we proceed on the basis that the appellant
      was convicted of a sexual assault based on the single act of fellatio.  No
      deference is owed to the trial judge’s sentence as we have no way of knowing
      the factual basis upon which he proceeded in imposing sentence.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Even
      though the crime involved only a single act of sexual misconduct, it is
      still a very serious offence.  The appellant was in a position of trust.  The
      complainant was very young and because of her troubled home life, particularly
      vulnerable.  A significant period of incarceration was called for.  The
      appellant served the equivalent of seven months pre-sentence custody.  Having
      regard to that seven months, we are satisfied that an additional sentence
      of 15 months is appropriate.  We would allow the appeal from sentence and
      vary the sentence imposed to 15 months.  </span></p>
