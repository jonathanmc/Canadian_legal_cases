  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment
      of Justice W.P. Somers of the Superior Court of Justice, dated May 31,
      2005.</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, this appeal must be dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence concerning
    the date of the appellant’s execution of the agreed statement of facts (the “ASF”),
    in which the appellant admitted that his two sons were in need of protection
    at the time when they were taken into custody by the respondent.  The respondent
    concedes that the trial judge misspoke in this respect, but says that the
    error is irrelevant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the respondent that the trial judge’s error in identifying the
    date of execution of the ASF by the appellant is not material.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant does not deny that he ultimately signed the ASF, at a time when
    he was represented by legal counsel, although he claims that he did so under
    duress.  The ASF contains the important admission to which we have referred.  The
    trial judge considered, and rejected, the appellant’s claim of duress.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also argues that he was not present in court on May 28, 2001 when
    an order for interim custody of his two sons was made in favour of the respondent.  He
    asserts that this interim order was fraudulently obtained and that he did
    not learn of it for several months.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    consent of the parties, a copy of the May 28, 2001 endorsement by Nelson
    J. of the Superior Court of Justice was provided to and reviewed by this
    court.  It is clear from the endorsement that the interim custody order was
    made on consent and that the appellant was represented by counsel during
    the court appearance when the order was made.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, although the appellant challenges its veracity, there was evidence
    before the trial judge that the appellant was also personally present in
    court on May 28, 2001.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    contrary to the appellant’s assertion before this court that he did not learn
    of the interim custody order and the involvement thereunder of the respondent
    in the care of his children until many months after the date of the order,
    the record before us reveals that within days of the disputed consent order,
    the appellant, through his legal counsel, brought a court motion (and swore
    an affidavit in support of that motion) in which he acknowledged the involvement
    and actions of the respondent and challenged its intervention on jurisdictional
    grounds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the end, regardless of whether the appellant was personally present in court
    at the time of the interim custody order, he was represented by counsel.  There
    is no evidence before us to support any allegation of ineffective legal representation
    at that time, nor is there any evidence that the appellant’s legal counsel
    lacked authority to act on the appellant’s behalf or to bind him as of the
    date of the impugned order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    although the appellant asserted in his factum filed with this court that
    the trial judge exhibited bias against him during the conduct of the trial,
    and that the trial itself was unfair for various reasons, he did not pursue
    these submissions during oral argument of this appeal.  In any event, based
    on our review of the record before us, these assertions are completely unfounded.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    for the reasons given, the appeal is dismissed.  The respondent is entitled
    to its costs of this appeal on the partial indemnity scale, fixed in the
    total amount of $5451.11, inclusive of disbursements and Goods and Services
    Tax.</p>
