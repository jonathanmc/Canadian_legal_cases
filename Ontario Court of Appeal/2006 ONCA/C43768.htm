    respondent is the plaintiff in a proposed class action against the Canadian
    corporation, National Money Mart Company (“Money Mart”) and against its American
    parent company, the appellant, Dollar Financial Group Inc. (“Dollar Financial”).
    The appellant moved for an order setting aside service out of the jurisdiction
    and for an order dismissing or staying the action against it for lack of
    jurisdiction in the Ontario court. The motion judge dismissed the motions.
    I agree with the conclusions reached by the motion judge that, (a) the respondent
    was entitled to serve the appellant out of the jurisdiction and, (b) the
    Ontario court has jurisdiction because there is a real and substantial connection
    between the appellant and Ontario in the context of the claims made in this
    action.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    proposed class action seeks damages from the two defendants on the basis
    that Money Mart’s “pay-day loan” or “fast-cash advance”
    product effectively charges customers interest that grossly exceeds the rate
    prescribed by s. 347 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. The plaintiff, Margaret
    Smith, lives only on her Canada Pension. She obtained several small loans
    from Money Mart at a disclosed interest rate of 59%, 1% below the legal maximum
    rate. However, with late fees and a cheque cashing fee that are alleged to
    be built into the timing of the repayment set up for the loan, it is alleged
    that the effective rate of interest on her loans ranged from 329% to 578%.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    action seeks a remedy from Dollar Financial, the sole shareholder of twenty-three
    subsidiaries including DFG International, Inc., which itself is the sole
    shareholder of Money Mart, on the basis of conspiracy and unjust enrichment.
    It also alleges that Dollar Financial totally controls Money Mart and effectively
    carries on business in Ontario through its Money Mart stores. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant says that it is a New York State corporation that does not carry
    on business in Ontario. It has no offices, employees or physical assets in
    Ontario. The appellant says that its relationship with Money Mart is a normal
    parent-subsidiary relationship that does not allow the court to pierce the
    corporate veil. It denies any conspiracy and says that, in any event, the
    alleged conspiracy would have merged with the commission of the tort in Ontario
    by Money Mart. It denies any unjust enrichment in fact or in law. Finally,
    the appellant says that there is no good, arguable case for any cause of
    action set out in Rule 17.02 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, and
    therefore service <i>ex juris</i> was improper and must be set aside.</p>

    Mart has existed in Canada since 1982 and was purchased by Dollar Financial
    in November 1996. Dollar Financial also purchased the outstanding shares

  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:

'>·</span>    Money Mart introduced the pay-day loans into the Canadian market
    the same year it was acquired by Dollar Financial.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>At

      Financial received both royalty fees and management fees from Money Mart.
      The royalty fees were agreed to be paid to compensate Dollar Financial
      for its management and expertise in developing, maintaining and managing
      the U.S. “Cash til Payday” product before it was introduced as “Fast Cash” in
      Canada. The initial royalty rate was 4.5% of Money Mart’s annual revenue,
      later reduced to 2.5%. </span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In
      a study done by Ernst &amp; Young, Money Mart’s auditors, for Dollar Financial,
      the auditors concluded that the royalty rate was reasonable “given the
      management and expertise provided by Dollar Financial to Money Mart.”</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The
      auditors also concluded that the high level of management and services
      of all kinds provided by Dollar Financial to Money Mart justified significant
      management fees. In 1998 those fees were U.S. $1.289 million.</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;'><span

      only was Dollar Financial’s Board of Directors required to approve the
      acquisition by Money Mart of all of its franchisees in Ontario and elsewhere
      in Canada, but both the CEO and the President and CFO of Dollar Financial
      were personally involved in all of Money Mart’s franchisee acquisitions
      in Canada.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on these findings, the motion judge concluded that even without officers
    and employees in Ontario, the evidence disclosed “a strong link between the
    Defendants and the claims of Margaret Smith and other proposed members of
    the class.” She also relied on the pleaded torts that “arguably occurred
    in Ontario” and referred to Rule 17.02 and concluded that there was a good,
    arguable case on which to base service out of the jurisdiction. The motion
    judge concluded that there was jurisdiction in the Ontario court over Dollar
    Financial in this action.</p>

lang=EN-US>(1)      The Standard of Review</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue of the proper jurisdiction of the court is a question of law on which
    the standard of review on appeal is correctness: see <i>Khan Resources v.
    W.M. Mining Co. LLC</i>, [2006] O.J. No. 845 (C.A.) and cases cited therein
    at para.&nbsp;7.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    record on the motion consisted of the amended statement of claim as well
    as affidavits and cross-examination thereon. The motion judge was required
    to make findings based on the record for the purpose of determining the issues
    on the motion. Of course these “findings of fact” are for the limited purpose
    of the motion and are not the ultimate findings that would be made after
    a trial. However, such findings are treated as findings of fact for the purpose
    of appellate review and are accorded deference on that basis on this appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
    this court must examine the legal conclusion reached by the motion judge,
    accepting her findings of fact, subject to palpable and overriding error.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(2)       Service <i>ex juris</i> under
      Rule 17.02 and Rule 17.03 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the motion judge erred in declining to set aside service <i>ex
    juris</i>, on the basis that the pleaded causes of action do not fall with
    R. 17.02.<i> </i>However, the respondent did not serve the appellant without
    leave under Rule 17.02 but rather obtained an order from Winkler R.S.J. allowing
    service out of the jurisdiction under Rule 17.03. The appellant does not
    seek to set aside that order on this appeal, but rather argues that service <i>ex
    juris</i> was improper because there was no real arguable case against the
    appellant under any of the criteria set out in Rule 17.02. Rule 17.03(1)
    provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>17.03(1) In any case to which Rule 17.02 does not
    apply, the court may grant leave to serve an originating process or notice
    of a reference outside Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    record on appeal does not contain the Rule 17.03 order, or the affidavit
    on which it was based, although the parties provided this court with excerpts
    from their factums on the original motion, which do address the interrelation
    between the two rules.   It is clear that this court is not in a position
    to consider the propriety of the order or to set it aside.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, the real issue on this appeal is jurisdiction <i>simpliciter</i>:
    whether the motion judge erred in law in concluding that there is a real
    and substantial connection between the action against the appellant and Ontario
    in order to found jurisdiction based on a good, arguable case against the
    appellant on one of the pleaded causes of action. The criteria for service
    out of the jurisdiction without leave are just examples of the type of connection
    with the jurisdiction that would allow an Ontario court to take jurisdiction
    over an out of province party: <i>Muscutt v. Courcelles</i> (2002), 60 O.R.
    (3d) 20 (C.A.) at pp. 37-38; <i>Vita Pharm Canada Ltd. v. Hoffman-LaRoche
    et al. </i>(2002), 20 C.P.C. (5th) 351 (Ont. S.C.J.) at para. 91. Finally
    on this issue, as will be discussed later in the reasons, I agree with the
    motion judge that there is a valid plea of the tort of conspiracy in Ontario
    against the appellant, which brings the action within Rule 17.02(g).</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(3)       Is there a real and
      substantial connection between this action and the      appellant based
      on any of the causes of action pleaded against it?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    essence of the appellant’s submission is that the respondent has no good,
    arguable legal case against it based on any of the causes of action pleaded,
    and that in those circumstances, it would be unfair for Ontario to take jurisdiction
    over the appellant as a foreign defendant because of the tenuous nature of
    the legal connection between Ontario and the appellant.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The <i>Alter Ego</i> Theory</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant says that the respondent is asking the court to pierce the corporate
    veil in circumstances that amount only to the normal relationship between
    a parent and subsidiary corporation. However, the motion judge’s findings
    belie that submission. She accepted facts that show that Dollar Financial
    was instrumental in introducing the payroll loan product into Canada through
    its Money Mart subsidiary and in expanding the operation, with the effect
    of maximizing Money Mart’s revenues and therefore Dollar Financial’s royalty
    payments based on those revenues. There was clear evidence of control of
    operations by the parent, combined with knowledge of the prohibition in the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> against charging over 60% as an effective rate of interest on loans. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, these facts are sufficient at this stage to ground a good, arguable
    case for holding the appellant responsible for the acts of its subsidiary.
    In <i>Transamerica Life Insurance Co. v. Canada Life Assurance Co.</i> (1996),
    28 O.R. (3d) 423 (Gen. Div.), aff’d. [1997] O.J. No. 3754 (C.A.) the test
    was stated as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he courts will disregard the separate legal
    personality of a corporate entity where it is completely dominated and controlled
    and being used as a shield for fraudulent or improper conduct. The first
    element, ‘complete control’, requires more than ownership. It must be shown
    that there is complete domination and that the subsidiary company does not,
    in fact, function independently. … </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The second element relates to the nature of the
    conduct: is there “conduct akin to fraud that would otherwise unjustly deprive
    the claimants of their rights”? (pp. 433-434)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge accepted evidence indicating sufficient control over Money Mart,
    together with the improper conduct of charging well in excess of the criminal
    interest rate to vulnerable borrowers in Canada who are not able to obtain
    loans from lenders charging reasonable rates.  I agree that there is a good,
    arguable case against the appellant on the basis that it is Money Mart’s <i>alter
    ego</i>.</p>

    second cause of action is in tort: conspiracy between Dollar Financial and
    Money Mart to breach the <i>Criminal Code</i> by charging interest to borrowers
    in Ontario well in excess of the criminal rate. The appellant makes two submissions
    challenging the efficacy of this claim. The first is that again, the evidence
    amounts to nothing more than normal relations between a parent and subsidiary
    corporation with no particulars of a conspiracy. The second is that once
    Money Mart contravened the <i>Code</i> by making the fast cash loans, any
    conspiracy merged with the breach.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge relied on the tort claim and found that the tort arguably occurred
    in Ontario. She was satisfied that there was sufficient evidence of a good,
    arguable case that the two defendants conspired together to carry out the
    breach of s. 347(1) of the <i>Code</i>. Contrary to the submission of the
    appellant, there can be a conspiracy between a parent and a subsidiary corporation.
    The appellant submits that if Money Mart was controlled by Dollar Financial
    to the extent alleged in the action, then it follows that any agreement between
    them would be tantamount to an agreement with oneself, and one cannot conspire
    with oneself. Although that is an interesting analysis, the appellant’s position
    is that the two companies are independent of each other and do not operate
    as one. Either way, where one controls the other, as two separate legal entities
    each remains responsible in law for its own actions, even if Dollar Financial
    is also responsible for some or all of the actions of its subsidiary. Nor
    is this an allegation of a conspiracy under the <i>Competition Act</i>, where
    s. 45(8) does not recognize a conspiracy with an affiliated corporation.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the argument that a conspiracy to commit a tort merges with the
    tort, in this case the conspiracy is in respect of a breach of the law. There
    is no separate tort alleged. Nor is there a separate claim for breaching
    the law into which the conspiracy claim could merge. The only separate claim
    into which the conspiracy could merge is for unjust enrichment. The appellant’s
    position is that there can be no claim against it for unjust enrichment because
    it had no direct dealings with the Ontario borrowers like the plaintiff:
    see <i>Boulanger v. Johnson &amp; Johnson Corp</i>. (2003), 174 O.A.C. 44
    (C.A.) at para. 20. If the appellant is correct, then again, there is no
    cause of action into which the conspiracy can merge. At this stage, there
    is a good, arguable case for the tort of conspiracy, and the issue of merger
    should be left for trial.  I will next deal with the claim for unjust enrichment.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Unjust Enrichment</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this appeal, it is only necessary to show a good, arguable case for the pleaded
    causes of action, as a foundation for a real and substantial connection between
    the appellant and Ontario. In this case, there was evidence in the record
    to show that the appellant was not merely the ultimate parent of Money Mart,
    but that it was enriched by receiving substantial royalties and management
    fees based on its contribution to the pay-day loan portion of Money Mart’s
    business, that the respondent suffered a deprivation and that the enrichment
    was unlawful. It is therefore arguable that the <i>Boulanger </i>case is
    distinguishable on the facts, and that there is a good, arguable case that
    Dollar Financial was unjustly enriched.</p>
  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Constructive Trust</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent’s claim for constructive trust is that both defendants hold the
    alleged illegally charged interest on constructive trust for the respondent
    and other members of the class. That claim is effectively a remedial one
    that applies only if the action is made out in respect of the <i>alter ego</i> theory,
    the conspiracy or the unjust enrichment.<i></i></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Muscutt Factors</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the motion judge that the respondent has made out a good, arguable, <i>prima
    facie</i> case for its three bases of liability against the appellant: that
    the appellant is the <i>alter ego</i> of Money Mart and responsible for its
    breach of the <i>Code</i>, that the appellant conspired with Money Mart to
    breach the <i>Code</i> and that the appellant was unjustly enriched.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    next step in the jurisdiction analysis is to apply the eight <i>Muscutt </i>factors
    for the real and substantial connection test. The motion judge did not address
    the factors individually. However, the appellant’s argument was not focused
    on the application of the factors, but rather on the allegedly tenuous nature
    of the legal case against the appellant. The motion judge summed up her reason
    for finding jurisdiction by relying on the strong link between the claims
    of the plaintiff class and the defendants. I read this conclusion as subsuming
    the <i>Muscutt</i> factors in terms of the ultimate fairness of bringing
    the action in Ontario.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    for the purpose of the appeal, I will address each factor briefly. The first
    is the connection between the forum and the claim. The claim is that consumers
    in Ontario (and the rest of Canada other than British Columbia) were charged
    a criminal rate of interest and suffered damage as a result. There is a clear
    connection to Ontario. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second factor is the connection between Ontario and the appellant. That has
    been discussed in detail in the analysis of the good, arguable case against
    the appellant.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third factor is unfairness to the appellant if Ontario assumes jurisdiction.
    The appellant has a very significant financial interest in Ontario and does
    business here through its subsidiary. Its business practices affected consumers
    here. It is not unfair for the appellant to respond to a lawsuit brought
    against it in Ontario by those consumers affected by its practices. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fourth factor is unfairness to the respondent if Ontario does not assume
    jurisdiction. In that case, the respondent would be obliged to sue the two
    corporations separately in two different forums. In circumstances where the
    defendant’s business generates very significant revenue for the appellant
    from Ontario consumers and where much of that revenue is alleged to have
    been illegally charged, this factor favours the Ontario respondent/plaintiff.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Factor
    five is the involvement of other parties in the Ontario lawsuit and the concerns
    about a multiplicity of proceedings and of potentially inconsistent verdicts.
    The appellant previously challenged the propriety of the action brought against
    Money Mart, relying on an arbitration clause contained in its loan agreement
    with borrowers including the respondent. That challenge was dismissed at
    this stage, but will be one of the considerations in the class certification
    motion: see <i>Smith v. National Money Mart Co,</i> [2005] O.J. No. 4269
    (C.A.), leave to appeal to the S.C.C. denied [2005] S.C.C.A. No. 528. Therefore,
    at this time, the action against Money Mart remains extant and the concerns
    regarding a multiplicity of proceedings favour jurisdiction by Ontario over
    the appellant in the action.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sixth factor is whether Ontario would recognize a U.S. judgment against an
    Ontario corporation rendered on the same jurisdictional basis. On the basis
    of international comity, and given the strength of the factors that connect
    the appellant and the action with this jurisdiction, as well as the fact
    that the judgment sought is a money judgment and not an <i>in rem</i> judgment
    involving land in another jurisdiction, it is likely that applying normal
    principles of private international law, Ontario would enforce such a judgment:
    see Janet Walker, <i>Canadian Conflicts of Laws</i>, 6th ed. (Markham, Ontario:
    LexisNexis Canada Inc., 2005) at §14.3 and §14.5.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    seventh factor speaks to the fact that courts in Canada are more likely to
    assume jurisdiction where the defendant is a resident of another province
    because of the federal nature of the country. This case involves an international
    defendant, a fact that militates, on its own, against assuming jurisdiction. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    final factor is principles of international comity. No evidence was presented
    as to whether a judgment in this case would be enforceable against the appellant
    in New York or Pennsylvania. However, given the substantial connection that
    has been found by the motion judge with this jurisdiction, absent any evidence
    to the contrary there is no basis to conclude that a judgment of an Ontario
    court in this case would not be enforceable there.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, weighing all of the factors, the motion judge made no error in concluding
    that the real and substantial connection test has been met and that Ontario
    has jurisdiction in this case.<i></i></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>RESULT</span></h4>
