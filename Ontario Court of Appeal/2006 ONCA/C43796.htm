    1993, the appellants’ father, Robert van den Hoef Sr., and his then-wife,

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Barbados</st1:country-region>
    and establish residency there in order to take advantage of certain Canadian

    acres in South Glengarry,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario
    (the “property”) and all of the household contents (the “chattels”). </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By
    an agreement dated December 1, 1994, Robert Sr. made the property and chattels
    the subject of a trust for the benefit of his grandchildren, and established a
    trust fund to be used for the maintenance of the property. He named his three
    children, Robert Jr., Gigi, and Richard, trustees. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    terms of the trust provide that the trust property and fund are to be used for
    the benefit and enjoyment of the beneficiaries, for as long as the trustees
    consider appropriate. A unanimous decision of the trustees is required to sell
    the property, and a two-thirds majority decision to take any other action.
    Should the trustees decide to sell, the trust directs that they hold and invest
    the proceeds on behalf of the beneficiaries until the youngest beneficiary
    reaches twenty-one years of age. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

    the terms of the trust, Richard was made managing trustee. He was authorized to

    1994 and 1999 the actual use of the subject property did not change. Robert Sr.
    and Maria occupied the property when they came to
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    , mostly in the summer
    months. Robert Sr. funded a bank account to maintain the property, and Richard
    was the only trustee authorized to sign on that account.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Beginning
    in 1999, Richard occupied the trust property and paid rent according to his
    ability at the time with the concurrence of his co-trustees. When he was
    unemployed the rent was reduced; when employed it increased. Richard, for his
    part, maintained the property, shovelling the snow in winter, cutting the grass
    in the other seasons, and arranging for any necessary repairs. There was no
    objection to Richard’s occupation of the property or his activities in relation
    thereto until May of 2002.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    2000 Robert Sr. and Maria separated. Maria returned to
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    and also
    took up residence in the property. The relationship between Richard and his
    mother soon deteriorated, as did the relationship between Maria and Robert Sr.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It
    is unnecessary for present purposes to detail all the interactions among the
    parties which led to the institution of the proceedings that are the subject of
    this appeal. Suffice it to say that, as the trial judge noted, what was a
    “somewhat normal family dynamic” became “sour and antagonistic in the spring of
    2002.” Robert Jr. and Gigi sided with Maria while Richard took Robert Sr.’s
    part. Needless to say, it was quite impossible for Robert Jr. and Gigi on the
    one hand and Richard on the other to agree on anything. Robert Jr. and Gigi
    wanted Richard removed as a trustee, evicted from the property, and the
    property sold. Richard wanted Robert Jr. and Gigi removed as trustees and the property
    maintained.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The

  <h3><u>THE PROCEEDINGS</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By Statement of Claim issued May 31, 2002, Robert Sr.
    commenced an action against Robert Jr. and Gigi for the return of personal
    items that he alleged they had taken from the trust property on May 14 and 15,
    2002. In addition, Robert Sr. claimed the return of over $10,000.00 that he
    alleged Robert Jr. had taken from a bank account the two (Robert Sr. and Robert
    Jr.) held jointly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I note that the Statement of Claim did not state that
    the action was brought under Rule 76. It appears, however, that on February 3,
    2003 the claim was amended “as a simplified rules proceeding.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The personal items allegedly removed from the trust
    property included Robert Sr.’s will, his written instructions to his executors
    kept with his will, corporate documents including the corporate seal and bearer
    share certificates of Maasbree Holdings Ltd., several works of art, and about
    $12,000.00 in cash. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In their Statement of Defence, Robert Jr. and Gigi
    admitted taking the items but claimed they were justified in doing so because
    the property (with the exception of their father’s will, which they said had
    been taken in error and subsequently returned) was either trust property or
    property to be used for the maintenance of the trust, which it was their duty
    as trustees to preserve and protect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By Notice of Application issued August 21, 2002, Robert
    Jr. and Gigi, in their capacity as trustees, commenced an application against
    Richard pursuant to the provisions of sections 3 and 60 of the <i>Trustee Act</i>.
    In their original Notice of Application they sought an order removing Richard
    as trustee and requiring him to return trust chattels and vacate the trust
    property. In their amended Notice of Application they sought additional relief,
    including leave to “dispose of the trust premises” without the consent of
    Richard or any trustee appointed to replace him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By Notice of Cross-Application issued January 7, 2004,
    Richard sought the removal of Robert and Gigi as trustees.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The action, application and cross-application were
    ordered tried together. The matter came on for hearing before Cusson J.,
    commencing November 8, 2004. The action was tried first and took five days to
    complete. The application and cross-application followed immediately thereafter
    and took a further seven days. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the action, the trial judge dismissed Robert Sr.’s
    claims for certain works of art and a trust property file, but ordered all
    monies, corporate documents and materials claimed by Robert Sr. be returned to
    him. He found that the actions of Robert Jr. and Gigi in removing those items
    were not motivated by any desire to protect the interests of the beneficiaries
    of the trust, but rather to even things up as between Maria and Robert Sr. in
    relation to their pending divorce. His findings in this respect are well
    supported by the evidence and, in my view, unassailable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the application and cross-application, the trial
    judge concluded that none of the trustees was to be removed from office.
    Instead, he directed the trustees to appoint a real estate agent and to sell
    the property and its contents forthwith. Richard was to continue to occupy  and maintain the property until it was sold,
    at which time he was to give vacant possession. An auctioneer was to be
    retained to dispose of the trust chattels. All net proceeds of sale were to be
    paid into court to the credit of beneficiaries of the trust on the terms set
    out in the original trust agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A reference was directed for Richard to provide an
    accounting of rental monies actually paid by him from July 1, 2000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs submissions in all proceedings were made
    September 12, 2005 and reasons for the costs disposition delivered September
    27, 2005. In his action against Robert Jr. and Gigi, Robert Sr. was awarded
    costs on a substantial indemnity scale in the fixed sum of $55,084.57. Counsel
    agreed that the sum of $3,500.00 previously paid was to be deducted from this
    sum, leaving a total of $51,584.57 awarded against Robert Jr. and Gigi
    personally.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No costs were awarded in the application and
    cross-application except to the Children’s Lawyer. No issue is take in this
    court in relation to those costs. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Richard appeals the merits of the disposition of the
    application and cross-application which ordered the sale of the trust property
    (the merits appeal). Robert Jr. and Gigi appeal the costs disposition in the
    action as well as in the application and the cross-application, which were, as
    noted above, treated as one proceeding.</p>

    that the only viable option was the sale of the entire trust, both real
    property and chattels.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    thrust of the appellant’s submission is that the trial judge erred in law in
    ordering a sale of the trust property without taking into consideration the

    no power in the trust document for the trustees to sell the trust property
    absent their unanimous consent.</span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>A
    broadly worded power of amendment and careful attention to its terms is the
    most secure guarantee for the valid amendment of a trust. What can be done if
    the trust instrument does not contain an amending power, or the amending power
    is not drafted so as to create sufficient flexibility?  One option is to end the trust. But situations
    may still arise in which the desire is to keep the trust afoot, but to modify
    its terms in someway. The only avenue of recourse – apart from terminating the
    trust and starting over – is to the courts. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    English courts, unfortunately, took a very restrictive view of the assistance
    that could be offered in such cases. The House of Lords held that the courts do
    not have an inherent jurisdiction to vary the terms of a trust. This inability
    exists even when beneficiaries who are <i>sui juris</i> agree to the variation
    and the variation would clearly benefit the remaining minor or unascertained
    beneficiaries. The courts, it was held, could vary the terms of a trust only in
    extremely limited circumstances. The Canadian courts followed suit, with the
    result that, at common law, the courts can vary trusts only in conversion,
    compromise, emergency and maintenance situations. [Footnote omitted.]</span></p>

    learned authors go on to describe these four situations, of which only two –
    conversion and emergency – have possible relevance to the issues raised here.
    As the authors note at pp. 89-90:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Conversion
    describes the power of the court to direct that realty held for the benefit of
    a minor may be changed into personalty and <i>vice versa</i>. It must be
    established, to the court’s satisfaction, that the conversion is for the
    benefit of the minor.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    court may approve variations of trust in emergencies. Emergencies are
    situations which had not been foreseen by the settlor, which were not provided
    for, and which threaten the existence of the trust.</span></p>

    possible way a trust may be altered or amended is by the court pursuant to statute.
    Where a trust is to be maintained but some clarification or amendment is needed
    and the amending power is insufficient, two different statutory mechanisms can
    be used to gain the assistance of the court. Trustee legislation and rules of
    court may provide some limited relief, though the assistance sought must not be
    tantamount to a variation of trust. For a change of that magnitude, resort may
    be had to the <i>Variation of Trusts Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. V.1. In any
    variation application three things are required: (i) there must be someone on
    whose behalf the court can act in giving consent; (ii) there must be a proposed
    arrangement; and (iii) the court must be satisfied that there will be a benefit
    to those on whose behalf it gives consent.</span></p>

    the present case, as it proceeded before the trial judge, no apparent effort
    was made to consider the interests of the beneficiaries of the trust. Moreover,
    it could reasonably be argued that the settlor did foresee that the three
    trustees might disagree on the disposition of the trust property, and for that
    very reason specifically included the term that all three had to agree to any
    sale of the property while for other decisions only a two-thirds majority was
    necessary. In my view, the court should not have entertained the requests of
    Robert Jr. and Gigi under its inherent power or under the trustee legislation
    or the Rules. Although the relief sought is technically just the conversion of
    real and personal property into money, that change is one which, given the
    nature of the trust, is anything but minor.</span></p>

    a showing that Richard in fact occupied the premises at less than fair market
    value, there was no evidentiary basis upon which to find that his residence

    should be reduced by $3,500.00 to $51,584.57.</span></p>

    the trust.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>What
    the appellants suggest is “divided success” is characterized very differently
    by the trial judge. Claims that Robert Sr. abandoned were said by the trial
    judge to have occupied very little trial time. Clearly the trial judge was in
    the best position to make this observation and to conclude that the plaintiff
    had been largely successful in the action. While the quantum of costs awarded
    seems high, it must be remembered that the trial of just this part of the
    proceedings took some five days.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    addition to the trial itself, the appellants instituted a number of motions
    against the respondent in which they were largely unsuccessful. Costs of those
    motions were made against them, and, but for the $3,500.00 payment referenced
    earlier, all of those costs awards remained unpaid. The appellants may be
    described as having played “hard ball” and they now face the costs consequences
    of their strategy.</span></p>

    would have agreed that there did not seem any basis for costs to have been
    awarded on a substantial indemnity scale. I do note, however, that both the
    appellants and the respondent sought costs on a substantial indemnity basis
    before the trial judge. Most importantly all parties <i>agreed </i> that costs were to be awarded on a substantial
    indemnity basis. As the trial judge gave no reasons indicating the basis for
    his decision to award costs on the higher scale, I can only assume he did so
    because of the agreement of counsel.</span></p>

    proceedings were most unfortunate for all. In one of the motions before him,
    Lalonde J. aptly described the situation as “an ugly family squabble.” It is
    clear on this record that the divorce of Robert Sr. and Maria resulted in a
    bitter division among their three children. The trial judge was alive to the
    situation and reasonably concluded that it was this division that motivated the
    parties’ actions and drove the litigation. There was no evidence of thought or
    consideration for the beneficiaries of the trust, and the trust itself did not
    benefit in any way from the litigation.</span></p>

    Jr. and Gigi decided, without consulting Robert Sr. or Richard, to adopt a
    self-help approach to ensuring that the distribution of property between their
    mother and father accorded with their sense of what was fair in the
    circumstances. As the trial judge found, their actions had nothing to do with
    protecting the trust or furthering the interests of the beneficiaries. They
    were interested only in helping their mother at the expense of their father and
    brother. The trial judge’s findings in this respect are well supported in the
    evidence. Robert Jr. and Gigi must personally bear the costs of this
