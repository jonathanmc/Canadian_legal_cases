    Lawson, the appellant, and Beverley Lawson, the respondent, were married
    on February 3, 1990.  They separated in April 2002 after twelve years of
    marriage.  At the time of separation, they had three young children.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly
    after they married, the parties moved into a house on a property on the Niagara
    escarpment just outside of Grimsby, Ontario.  The house had been previously
    occupied by the appellant’s parents.  The appellant’s father had divided
    his farm into two parcels, one for each of his sons.  He gave a 36-acre parcel
    to his son, Jay Lawson.  He gave the appellant a 20-acre parcel that included
    the house.  The parties lived on the 20-acre property for the duration of
    their marriage.  The respondent and children continue to live in the house.  The
    respondent wants to move from the property, with the children, but needs
    support and an equalization payment to do that.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Throughout

    working on the property.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    9 days of trial, in which 20 witnesses testified, Dandie&nbsp;J. issued the
    order under appeal dated June 7, 2005 (the
    “Order”).  His reasons for decision cover the issues of custody, access,
    child support, spousal support, arrears of support, what part of the property
    is the matrimonial home, the value to be ascribed to the property, equalization
    of net family property and whether income is to be imputed to the appellant.  The
    reasons are three and a half typewritten pages in length.  </p>

    of the marriage, or in the alternative, sole custody;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>(b)       the access provisions

    4:30 p.m.; </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:

  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>(c)       that only the value of
    matrimonial home and one acre of the property located at 29 Ridge Road West,
    Grimsby, Ontario be included in the calculation of the husband’s net family
    property;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>(d)       that the value of the
    farm and the matrimonial home located at 29 Ridge Road West, Grimsby, Ontario
    be fixed at $345,000 as of the date of separation and that the value of the
    excluded portion of the property (the farm, gifted to the husband by his
    father) be fixed at $180,000 at separation;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>(e)       that the value of the

    payment owing by the Appellant to the Respondent in the amount of $65,088.19;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>(g)       an order dismissing Beverley

  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>(i)        in the alternative, an

    home for many years after separation without rent or charge;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>(j)        an order that the husband
    pay child support to Beverley Lawson  fixed in the table amount of $521 per
    month commencing on 1 June 2005 pursuant to the Federal Child Support Guidelines

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>THE OVERARCHING PRINCIPLES
        INVOLVED IN DECIDING THIS APPEAL </span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Before
      dealing with the many issues raised on appeal, some general comments are
      in order.  The first is our observation that this appeal arises, in part,
      because of the paucity of reasons given for decision at the trial level.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It
      is the duty of a judge to give reasons for decision; it is an inherent
      aspect of the discharge of a judge’s responsibilities.  See <i>R. v. Sheppard </i>(2001),
      162 C.C.C. (3d) 298 (S.C.C.).  The appellant is entitled to reasons that
      are sufficient to enable him to know why issues were decided against him.  The
      reasons need to be adequate also so that he can bring a meaningful appeal
      and this court is able to properly review the Order.  The reasons do not
      need to be perfect.  Nor do they necessarily need to be lengthy.  But,
      they must be sufficient to enable the parties, the general public and this
      court, sitting in review, to know whether the applicable legal principles
      and evidence were properly considered.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Having
      said that, we recognize that appellate courts are not to place an impossible
      burden on busy trial courts, in terms of the writing of reasons, and that
      a party’s right is to adequate reasons, not perfect ones.  See <i>R. v.
      Tzarfin</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 3531 (C.A.) at para. 9.    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While
      recognizing the trial judge’s obligation to give adequate reasons, however,
      it is important to note that the appellant is effectively asking this court
      to re&#8209;try the case.  That is not the function of an appellate court.  An
      appellate court is to be deferential.  It may interfere with a trial judge’s
      findings of fact only if there is a palpable and overriding error.  See <i>Housen
      v. Nickolaisen</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235.  The propriety of deference is
      manifest in this case, given the conflicting evidence on virtually every
      aspect of every issue.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Supreme Court of Canada wrote of the need for appellate deference in family
      law cases in <i>Hickey v. Hickey</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 518.  At paras.
      10 and 12, the court said:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>When family law legislation gives
      judges the power to decide on support obligations based on certain objectives,
      values, factors and criteria, determining whether support will be awarded
      or varied, and if so, the amount of the order, involves the exercise of
      considerable discretion by trial judges.  They must balance the objectives
      and factors set out in the <i>Divorce Act </i>or in provincial support
      statutes with an appreciation of the particular facts of the case.  It
      is a difficult but important determination, which is critical to the lives
      of the parties and to their children.  Because of its fact-based and discretionary
      nature, trial judges must be given considerable deference by appellate
      courts when such decisions are reviewed.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>This standard of appellate review
      recognizes that the discretion involved in making a support order is best
      exercised by the judge who heard the parties directly.  It avoids giving
      parties an incentive to appeal judgments and incur added expenses in the
      hope that the appeal court will have a different appreciation of the relevant
      factors and evidence.  This approach promotes finality in family law litigation
      and recognizes the importance of the appreciation of the facts by the trial
      judge.  Though an appeal court must intervene when there is a material
      error, a serious misapprehension of the evidence, or an error in law, it
      is not entitled to overturn a support order simply because it would have
      made a different decision or balanced the factors differently.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A
      tension exists between the right to adequate reasons and the need for appellate
      deference.  In the end, however, where an order is made without adequate
      reasons, unless the reasons are implicit or patent on the record, an appellate
      court has no access to the underlying reasons for the order and cannot
      afford it deference.   </span></p>

      However, one parent cannot create problems with the other parent and then

      says that rather than this being a high conflict situation, it is an “angry
      mother situation” and that the respondent’s behaviour and general hostility
      towards him is not a reason to deny him joint custody of the children.  He
      says that he is more than willing to cooperate with the respondent and
      that the respondent has denied him access to the children as a way to punish
      him.  He points to occasions on which he called the police as a result
      of the respondent’s behaviour, noting that the incidents occurred in front
      of the children.  He testified that the respondent has sworn at him in
      front of the children, and called his new wife disparaging names. </span></p>

      the result of an interim court order, the Office of the Children’s Lawyer
      was asked to investigate and report on all matters of custody and access.  A
      social worker conducted the investigation and prepared a thorough report.  She
      clearly and frankly states the appellant’s concerns about access and his
      view that the respondent is not well mentally, angers easily and does not
      keep the children clean.  He also told the investigator that the two older
      children were “doing worse at school and have missed many days this year”.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      investigator looked into these concerns and did a significant amount of
      collateral information gathering.  In addition to meeting with the children
      separately and at each parent’s homes and at the school, she interviewed
      the two older children’s teachers, the school counselor and the family
      physician.  The family physician stated that he had known the family for
      a long time and had delivered all of the children.</span></p>

      investigator addressed the appellant’s access concerns and concluded that
      part of the respondent’s issues in that regard stemmed from the fact that
      the appellant brought his girlfriend to the property at a very early stage
      after the breakup.  She also recommends that the appellant spend some time
      alone with the children.  At pages 12 to 13 of the report, she writes:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There has been a significant degree of conflict
    between the parents concerning access and it seems the mother has withheld
    access of the children from the father. It appears that some of the conflict
    around access could have been avoided if more attention was paid to the response
    of the mother and the children to the early involvement of the father’s girlfriend....</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The children are entitled to have a close relationship
    with their father.  Frequent access would be ideal, but the children do not
    appear to be able to tolerate more access at this time.  Due to the high
    degree of conflict between the parents during the exchange of the children,
    the children suffer from stress and tension.  …The children seem to be tolerating
    the current schedule of access visits, and this should remain in place.  It
    would be helpful to the children if they could have some quality time alone
    with their father … </p>

      social worker acknowledged that joint custody can be ideal for children
      but concluded that it was not appropriate in this situation.  On page 13,
      she wrote:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In many cases joint custody is an ideal situation
    for the children. However, there needs to be a degree of co-operation and
    minimal conflict between the parents for that plan to be workable. In the

      that they reside with their mother and see their father regularly.  He
      refers to the report cards of the two school-aged children, which show

      arguments in relation to custody hinged, in large part, on credibility.  One
      example is the police incidents.  He says they show the respondent’s true
      behaviour and attitudes but, as the respondent points out, no charges were
      laid and it was the appellant who chose to call the police, a very disturbing
      event for the children.  Another example is the spring concert at the children’s
      school where the appellant alleges that the respondent acted badly.  But
      a third party testified about the same incident, saying that the appellant,
      his now-wife and their parents, were provoking the respondent in an attempt
      to cause an altercation.  She said that

      respect of her parenting skills.  The evidence of those witnesses is that
      the respondent is an excellent mother.  The appellant did not cross-examine

      the layoff itself.  He decided that he wanted to be a full-time farmer
      and pursued that, in addition to working as a firefighter with the Grimsby
      Fire Department.  Despite the fact that the farm never made a profit during

      is capable of earning.  There is no need to find a specific intent to evade
      child support obligations before income can be imputed on the basis of
      intentional underemployment.  When imputing income based on intentional
      underemployment, a court must consider what is reasonable in the circumstances.  The
      factors to be considered are the age, education, experience, skills and
      health of the payor, as well as the payor’s past earning history and the
      amount of income the payor could earn if he or she worked to capacity.  See <i>Drygala

      the marriage.   It appears that the primary reason for his reduced income
      after he was laid off was his desire to pursue farming on a full-time basis.  The
      information necessary to determine what was reasonable in the circumstances,
      including the appellant’s earning history and the financial results of
      the farming operation during the marriage, were before the trial judge.  The
      record amply supports the trial judge’s determination that the appellant

      circumstances.  However, the trial judge appears to have made an error

      years prior to separation are 1999, 2000 and 2001.  The average of those

      below, the appellant acknowledged that he would have to pay spousal support
      and sought only an order setting the quantum.  In any event, even in the
      absence of reasons, a consideration of the parties’ respective conditions,
      means, needs and other circumstances, including the length of cohabitation
      and the functions each performed during the marriage, makes it clear that

      findings to support such a determination have not been made.  When such
      a determination is made, the appellant will be free to again raise, in
      the context of a consideration of the needs and means of both parties,
      whether the respondent is capable of earning income and, if so, what income
      ought to be imputed to her.  Further, the appellant can raise again the
      question of whether he has, in effect, paid spousal support by permitting
      the respondent to stay in occupation of the matrimonial home since the

      pending that determination and further order of the court.  In that regard,
      we would continue the order of Quinn J. dated June 22, 2004.  Pursuant
      to para. 4(c) of that order, the appellant was ordered to pay spousal support
      of $540 per month.  In making this order, Quinn J. acted on the assumption
      that the appellant would earn an income commensurate to that which he earned
      in 2003, namely $60,623.00, and he also considered the voluntary payments
      that the appellant had been making.  The assumed income relied on by Quinn
      J. is very similar to the appellant’s imputed income as found above.  Consequently,

      decided based on an articulation of the governing legal principles and
      factual findings.  As we are of the view that the reasons are inadequate
      on these issues and that they must be remitted for a fresh determination,
      it is appropriate to say little more.  It is sufficient to note that the
      trial judge fails to address foundational arguments of both parties.  The
      reasons do not address the appellant’s primary argument at trial that the
      farm had been in his family for over a hundred years and four generations
      and, for much of that time, had been farmed full-time and supported the
      Lawson family.  Consequently, the appellant maintained, it is not a hobby
      farm.  Nor is anything said in relation to his argument that the property
      was a gift to him from his father and that fact should be considered when
      deciding whether the entire property ought to be considered necessary to
      the use and enjoyment of the matrimonial home.  In our view, the appellant
      is entitled to know why his arguments on these matters are rejected.     </span></p>

      to the property is in the appellant’s name.  The reasons do not mention
      that and fail to address issues that arise from that.  For example, they
      do not speak to the respondent’s argument that she is entitled, on trust
      principles, to an ownership interest in the property even if it is not
      all properly designated matrimonial property.  Nor does the trial judge
      deal with the occupation of the property, apart from saying that he could
      be addressed as to whether there should be a court ordered sale.  Thus,
      it is not known how long the respondent and children can live on the property
      and there is nothing in the Order to explain how to resolve the occupation
      issue.  As a major issue at trial, ownership and occupation had to be dealt
      with.  For example, para. 9 of the Order fixes arrears of spousal support
      at $4,650.00.  While arrears of spousal support are not specifically raised
      in the Notice of Appeal or Supplementary Notice of Appeal, it is implicit
      that the appellant is challenging the arrears of spousal support on the
      basis that he has paid the respondent support by allowing her to occupy
      the property after marriage breakdown.  However, that argument rests on
      the fact that title is in the appellant’s name and that she has limited
      rights of occupation, none of which is addressed in the reasons.     </span></p>

      the trial judge states as a conclusion, without reasons, that he rejects
      the appellant’s claim that payment was made for a tractor but that the
