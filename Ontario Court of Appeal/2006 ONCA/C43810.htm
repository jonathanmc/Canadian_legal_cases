style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal concerns the availability of costs as s. 24(1) <i>Charter</i> remedy.  The
    Ontario Provincial Police (“O.P.P.”) obtained a search warrant and seized
    computers and computer records belonging to the appellant.  The items were
    in the possession of the police in British Columbia when seized.  Before
    the Ontario warrant was obtained, the British Columbia Supreme Court had
    quashed the B.C. warrant pursuant to which the British Columbia police had
    originally seized the items, and ordered the items returned to the appellant.  The
    appellant was not the target of either police investigation and he was never
    charged with an offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant brought an application and successfully challenged the validity
    of the O.P.P. warrant and secured the return of his property.  The application
    judge found that there had been a serious breach of the appellant’s s. 8 <i>Charter</i> right
    to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure.  The application judge
    found that there was no bad faith, improper purpose or misconduct on the
    part of the Crown, but that recklessly misleading evidence had been used
    to obtain the search warrant and that information in the Crown’s possession,
    together with some further investigation, “should have led [the authorities]
    to conclude that there was a probability that the warrant would be quashed.”  The
    application judge denied the appellant’s request for costs, applying “[t]he
    rule…that costs will only be awarded where there has been serious misconduct
    on the part of the Crown.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that as he was neither the target of the investigation
    nor charged as a result, he should not be required to establish serious Crown
    misconduct as a prerequisite for an award of the costs of his successful <i>Charter</i> challenge
    to the search warrant.  The Crown submits that this court has no jurisdiction
    to entertain the appeal and, in any event, that the application judge did
    not err in denying costs.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Delta Police Department executed a search warrant issued in British Columbia
    on June 24, 2002, in connection with a police investigation into the Hells
    Angels.  The appellant was not the target of the British Columbia investigation,
    nor was he ever charged with an offence in British Columbia.  The British
    Columbia warrant was executed by the Delta Police Department at the clubhouse
    of the Vancouver Chapter of the Hells Angels.  Computers and related items
    belonging to the appellant were seized. The appellant commenced proceedings
    in the British Columbia Supreme Court to challenge the validity of the search
    and to assert claims of solicitor-client privilege. Pending final resolution
    of that litigation, counsel for the appellant and counsel for the British
    Columbia Crown agreed that the police could examine the materials they had
    seized, other than material over which privilege was claimed, but that the
    police would not disseminate any information they obtained from the materials</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    October 29, 2002, Catliff J. of the British Columbia Supreme Court gave his
    oral judgment declaring that fourteen of the seventeen categories of items
    seized pursuant to the British Columbia warrant were unsupported by reasonable
    and probable grounds.  He ordered the return of the items seized under those
    fourteen categories.  The appellant’s counsel and counsel for the Crown could
    not agree on the scope and implications of Catliff J.’s order.  An appointment
    to settle the order was arranged. Before the order was settled, however,
    the investigating Delta officer decided that the non-dissemination agreement
    was no longer in effect.  Despite advice from the British Columbia Crown
    counsel that it would be prudent to wait until after the order was settled,
    he provided the Brampton O.P.P. with details of the information stored on
    the seized computer items.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'><i>2. The Ontario Warrant</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    O.P.P. used the information provided by the B.C. police to obtain an Ontario
    warrant, issued April 14, 2003, authorizing the seizure of the computer items
    still in the possession of the B.C. Delta Police as a result of the original
    seizure that Catliff J. had ordered should be returned to the appellant.  Again,
    the appellant was not the target of the O.P.P. investigation, nor was he
    charged with any offence in Ontario.  There were serious problems with the
    search warrant information.  It disclosed neither the non-dissemination agreement
    nor the existence of the appellant’s claim of solicitor-client privilege.  The
    informant swore that Catliff J. had upheld the validity of the search as
    it related to the items he was seeking.  This was completely incorrect: Catliff
    J.’s order was to the opposite effect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    existence of the Ontario warrant and the information used to obtain it were
    brought to Catliff J.’s attention on May 23, 2003, on the motion to settle
    his earlier order. Catliff J. was concerned that his order had been misrepresented.  He
    directed counsel for the British Columbia Crown to write to the Ontario Crown
    to “bring to the attention of the authorities in Ontario the fact that the…search
    warrant issued in Ontario for the premises of the Delta Police Department
    appears to be fundamentally flawed.”  The British Columbia Crown’s letter,
    dated May 26, 2003, detailed the circumstances of the Delta search, the proceedings
    brought by the appellant to challenge the Delta search, the order made by
    Catliff J., and the subsequent proceedings to settle the order.  The letter,
    which requested the voluntary return of the seized material, concluded with
    the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Mr. Justice
    Catliff expressed grave concern over what he perceived to be a total misrepresentation
    of the scope of his Order respecting the validity of the Delta search warrant.  He
    declined, however, to direct the Crown in BC to obtain the return of the
    items in the possession of the OPP within the time suggested by [counsel
    for the appellant].  Rather, Mr. Justice Catliff adjourned the motion to
    settle to Monday, June 2, 2003 so I could bring the misrepresentation to
    the attention of the Ontario authorities and allow them to voluntarily take
    the necessary corrective action and return all copies of items seized from
    the Delta Police Department.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='
text-align:left'><i>3. The Decision to Quash the Ontario Warrant</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant commenced proceedings in Ontario on October 8, 2003, to challenge
    the Ontario warrant and the seizure of his property from the Delta police.  Despite
    Catliff J.’s direction, the information that the B.C. proceedings had been
    misrepresented, and the request from the B.C. Crown that the items seized
    be returned, the Ontario Crown refused to return the seized items and decided
    to oppose the application to quash the Ontario warrant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    August 18, 2004, the application judge quashed the search warrant and ordered
    the O.P.P. to return the seized items.  He found that the nature of the B.C.
    proceedings had been misrepresented, that the non-dissemination agreement
    had been violated, and that the claim of solicitor-client privilege had not
    been disclosed.  He concluded that without the false and improper information,
    there was no basis to obtain the search warrant.  The application judge found
    that there had been a serious violation of the appellant’s s. 8 <i>Charter</i> rights.  He
    summarized his findings at para. 92:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>This is a case
    where I conclude that the lack of care exhibited and the nature of the omissions,
    including failing to properly advise of ongoing proceedings before a Superior
    Court of another jurisdiction, are so subversive of the preauthorization
    process that the warrant should be quashed.  The combination of failing to
    advise of the outstanding claim of solicitor-client privilege, the inaccurate
    overall description of the situation in British Columbia including failure
    to mention the non-dissemination agreement, and the failure to adequately
    characterize the court proceedings there, lead me to this conclusion.  In
    particular, the failure to respect the judicial process and the important
    principles of solicitor-client privilege lead me to this result.  These are
    fundamentally important matters that must be carefully guarded and protected.  In
    the context of search and seizure, that protection is provided in large measure
    by the process of judicial preauthorization.  The Information to Obtain the
    Brampton warrant completely failed to alert the Justice of the Peace to these
    important matters.  I conclude that the need to protect the preauthorization
    process requires that the warrant be quashed in these unusual, and hopefully
    rare, circumstances.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='
text-align:left'><i>4. The Costs Decision</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant asked for an order of costs against the Crown as a s. 24(1) <i>Charter</i> remedy.  In
    a subsequent decision dated April 18, 2005, the application judge dismissed
    that request.  The application judge recited that he “found that there had
    been a serious breach of s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>”, that the Delta officer
    breached the non-dissemination agreement, and “that the nature of the proceedings
    in British Columbia were misrepresented in the information to obtain the
    Brampton warrant.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge stated that if these were civil proceedings “there is little
    doubt that costs would follow the event” and that the appellant would receive
    at least partial compensation for the legal costs he had incurred.  However,
    as the proceedings were criminal in nature, he declined to order costs on
    the ground
    “that costs will only be awarded where there has been serious misconduct
    on the part of the Crown”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge ruled that it was important to distinguish the conduct
    of the Crown from the conduct of the police.  He observed that the <i>Charter </i>breach
    was particularly related to the conduct of the Delta police officer, an individual
    not under the direction or control of the Ontario Crown.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge found that the Ontario Crown was involved at two points
    in making decisions that resulted in the appellant having to bring proceedings
    in Ontario to protect his <i>Charter</i> rights: first, when the police were
    trying to determine the nature and extent of the B.C. proceedings; and second,
    upon receipt of the letter from the B.C. Crown relating Catliff J.’s concerns
    and requesting the voluntary return of the information.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the first point, the application judge found that the Ontario Crown had made
    inquiries to determine the nature and extent of the B.C. proceedings but
    that the B.C. Crown had not been forthcoming.  He concluded that “[a]lthough
    more could certainly have been done”, there had been “a <i>bona fide</i> effort
    made such that I am not able to say that there has been a marked departure
    from what would reasonably be expected of Crown counsel in the circumstances.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge made the following findings, at para. 17, with respect
    to the letter from the B.C. Crown:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In my view the
    letter of May 26, 2003 from Crown counsel in British Columbia, which is some
    three pages in length and quite detailed, provides a considerable amount
    of information. That information together with some further investigation
    by the Ontario authorities should have led them to conclude that there was
    a probability the warrant would be quashed.  In other words, I disagree with
    the Crown’s submission that the outcome was as uncertain as suggested in
    argument.  Be that as it may, I have no evidence that the Crown advice to
    the police was made in bad faith or for any improper purpose.  In addition,
    the Crown’s position, as advanced before me on the application to quash the
    warrant, was arguable and well argued.  I am not able to say that there was
    a marked departure from the conduct of the Crown that would be expected in
    the circumstances.  While the Crown did have considerable information after
    receiving the letter of May 26, 2003, and could have investigated to determine
    more, the Crown did not then have available all of the detailed information
    that was placed before me on the application to quash the warrant.  The Crown
    also had a legitimate public interest in pursuing evidence for use in an
    investigation and prosecution in Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge concluded that the serious <i>Charter</i> breaches in this
    case flowed primarily from the conduct of the police.  The Crown was involved
    at two important points of the process leading to the application to quash
    the warrant, but the application judge was not persuaded that there was Crown
    misconduct that would justify an award of costs.</p>

    costs awards in favour of the winning party are a feature of civil, not criminal
    proceedings.  Costs awards in civil litigation serve several purposes.  Costs
    in civil cases are awarded on the compensatory principle that it is just
    to allow the successful civil litigant at least partial indemnity for the
    costs of the action.  Costs sanctions are also an important tool at the disposal
    of civil courts to control proceedings and to discourage unreasonable or
    inappropriate behaviour.  Especially when fortified with offer to settle
    rules that penalize unreasonable litigation, the threat of an adverse costs
    award serves to discourage unnecessary or frivolous litigation and encourages
    parties to settle their disputes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Different
    considerations apply to criminal proceedings.  Criminal proceedings are brought
    in the public interest, not by one party to vindicate his or her private
    interests as against another.  As Devlin L.J. explained in <i>Berry v. British
    Transport</i>, [1962] 1 Q.B. 306 (C.A.) at p. 327: “A plaintiff brings an
    action for his own ends and to benefit himself; it is therefore just that
    if he loses he should pay the costs.  A prosecutor brings proceedings in
    the public interest, and so should be treated more tenderly.”  Costs are
    not usually deployed in criminal law to influence the conduct of litigation.  The
    threat of conviction and loss of liberty provides an adequate incentive to
    the accused to defend the case. As the Crown acts in the public interest
    when conducting criminal prosecutions, it is said that its discretion should
    not be influenced or fettered by the threat of a costs award.  As explained
    by McFadyen J.A. in <i>R. v. Robinson</i> (1999), 142 C.C.C. (3d) 303 (Alta.
    C.A.) at para. 29:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The reasons
    for limiting costs are that the Crown is not an ordinary litigant, does not
    win or lose criminal cases, and conducts prosecutions and makes decisions
    respecting prosecutions in the public interest.  In the absence of proof
    of misconduct, an award of costs against the Crown would be a harsh penalty
    for Crown officer carrying out such public duties.</p>

    agree with the appellant’s submission that as he established a serious breach
    of his <i>Charter</i> rights, we must consider whether costs are “appropriate
    and just in the circumstances” as s. 24(1) remedy. To what extent does s.
    24(1) permit or require a departure from the traditional Crown misconduct
    rule where the individual claiming costs has made out a breach of his or
    her <i>Charter</i> rights?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    traditional aversion to costs in criminal cases is a product of the pre-<i>Charter</i> era.
    Because of their constitutional status, <i>Charter</i> rights have a higher
    claim to judicial protection than non-<i>Charter</i> rights and s. 24(1)
    entitles the victim of a <i>Charter</i> breach to an appropriate remedy.  As
    stated in <i>R. v. Mills</i>, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 863 at 882, the purpose of
    s. 24(1) is to ensure that <i>Charter</i> rights are “easily available” and
    not “smothered in procedural delays and difficulties”.  Adopting this statement
    in <i>R. v. 974649 Ontario Inc.</i>,<i> supra</i>, at para. 20, McLachlin
    C.J.C. added: “Anything less would undermine the role of s. 24(1) as a cornerstone
    upon which the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the <i>Charter </i>are founded,
    and a critical means by which they are realized and preserved.” In light
    of the overriding purpose of s. 24(1) to guarantee effective and appropriate
    remedies for <i>Charter</i> breaches, I agree with the statement of Galligan
    J.A., writing for the majority in <i>R. v. Pawlowski</i>,<i> supra</i>, at
    p. 357, that the “clear effect of s. 24(1) is to enlarge the grounds” upon
    which the superior court’s inherent jurisdiction to award costs against the
    Crown may be exercised “to include a <i>Charter</i> infringement, along with
    misconduct by the prosecution”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the other hand, the authorities are clear that this does not mean that costs
    will be routinely ordered in favour of accused persons who establish <i>Charter</i> violations.
    Galligan J.A. cautioned in <i>R. v. Pawlowski</i> that costs awards in favour
    of an accused will be “rare”. As a general rule, when claimed by an accused,
    absent Crown misconduct, costs will not be an “appropriate and just” <i>Charter</i> remedy:
    see <i>R. v. 974649 Ontario Inc.</i>,<i> supra,</i> at para. 87; <i>R. v.
    Leduc</i> (2003), 176 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (Ont. C.A.) at para 161; <i>R. v. Robinson</i>,<i> supra.</i>  In <i>R.
    v. Hallstone Products Ltd., </i>[2000] O.J. No. 1051 (S.C.J.) at para. 33,
    LaForme J. suggested that the expanded jurisdiction to award costs against
    the Crown as a s. 24(1) remedy for a <i>Charter</i> breach in cases not involving
    Crown misconduct requires something that is
    “rare” or “unique” that “must at least result in something akin to an extreme
    hardship on the defendant.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the cases to which we have been referred do not consider costs as a <i>Charter </i>remedy
    when claimed by someone other than the accused.  On that point, this appears
    to be a case of first impression.  Does the fact that the party claiming
    costs as a <i>Charter</i> remedy was not the accused, together with any other
    unusual features of the case, render the traditional rationale for requiring
    serious Crown misconduct as a prerequisite for a costs award inapplicable?  </p>

line-height:normal'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, there are a number of features of this case that distinguish it
    from the usual situation where costs are not available absent Crown misconduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    the appellant was not the target of the investigation nor charged with any
    offence distinguishes this case from the cases that deal with the Crown misconduct
    rule in relation to an accused.  The appellant’s status as a bystander to
    the prosecution, rather than as the accused, materially alters the appropriate
    balance of interests between the need to protect <i>Charter</i> rights on
    the one hand and the need to afford free range to the prosecution on the
    other.  For the following reasons, I conclude that the rationale for limiting
    costs awards in favour of accused persons to cases of Crown misconduct does
    not apply with the same force to the bystander.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    there is a significant access to justice issue.  This area of law is complex
    and, as this case demonstrates, litigating a s. 8 issue can be very expensive.
    The bystander will have considerably less motivation than the criminal accused
    to defend his or her <i>Charter</i>-protected privacy rights.  The cost of
    mounting a <i>Charter</i> challenge will discourage the bystander from proceeding.
    Access to legal aid is unlikely. <i>Charter</i> rights should not come at
    an excessive price. The legal regime should encourage, not discourage, the
    ordinary citizen to stand up for his or her <i>Charter</i> rights.  If the
    bystander does proceed and is successful, he or she will perceive an element
    of injustice if saddled with the full cost of securing the <i>Charter</i>-protected
    right.  In my view, the compensatory principle that it is just to allow a
    successful litigant at least partial indemnity for the costs of litigation
    holds greater sway when the successful litigant is not the accused but a
    bystander to the criminal prosecution.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the situation of a bystander whose <i>Charter</i> rights are threatened or
    infringed is different than that of a criminal accused when it comes to the
    procedures and remedies available to protect his or her <i>Charter</i> rights.  The
    rules of the criminal process afford the accused procedural protections not
    available to the bystander. The risk of exclusion of evidence pursuant to
    s. 24(2) serves to dissuade the prosecution from actions that violate the
    accused’s <i>Charter </i>rights.  The bystander is more vulnerable.  The
    bystander’s <i>Charter</i> rights will not come under scrutiny in the ordinary
    course of the prosecution.  There are few, if any, disincentives on the authorities
    to discourage conduct that violates the bystander’s <i>Charter</i> rights.  As
    a general rule, they cannot be asserted by the accused and their violation
    will have little or no impact on the presentation of the case against the
    accused at trial: see <i>R. v. Edwards</i> (1996), 104 C.C.C. (3d) 136 (S.C.C.)
    at para. 55.  In my view, the vulnerability of the bystander considerably
    weakens the case for leaving the Crown’s discretion unfettered by the threat
    of an adverse costs award and considerably strengthens the case for awarding
    costs to ensure, in the spirit of s. 24(1), that there is a meaningful <i>Charter</i> remedy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the argument that Crown discretion should be unfettered by the threat of
    a costs order does not apply with the same force in the case of the bystander.  Given
    the lack of other controls, there is less to fear from orders that would
    encourage the Crown to pay greater heed to bystanders’ <i>Charter</i> rights.  The
    bystander is a member of the very public the prosecution is duty-bound to
    protect.  The cost of securing the <i>Charter</i> rights of an individual
    not suspected of criminal activity and not charged with an offence should
    not be automatically or routinely sacrificed in the cause of the general
    public interest.  There is an analogy here with cases where the Crown appeals
    to settle a point of law and is required to pay the respondent’s costs “because
    it is the public-at-large who are the beneficiaries of such a step and it
    is not considered just that one individual should be put to substantial expense
    when it is the Crown that seeks to effect a valid social purpose by taking
    the appeal”: <i>Trask v. The Queen </i>(1987), 37 C.C.C. (3d) 92 (S.C.C.)
    at p. 95.  While this dictum related to a narrow range of Crown appeals,
    Prof. Kent Roach identifies it as “a much broader rationale for granting
    costs…when a case is brought for the benefit of the public at large and when
    it is not just that the applicant should be put to a substantial expense”: <i>Constitutional
    Remedies</i>, looseleaf (Aurora: Canada Law Book, updated 2005) at para 11.920.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    I come to the unusual circumstances of this case.  First, the O.P.P. warrant
    authorized the seizure of items <span style='color:black'>that were in the
    possession of the Delta police under the B.C. warrant. Second, the items
    were the subject of judicial proceedings in British Columbia to determine
    what items could be legally kept under the B.C. warrant.</span> Third, in
    those proceedings, the B.C. Supreme Court ordered the items returned to the
    appellant. After achieving substantial if not total success in the British
    Columbia Supreme Court, the appellant was required to engage in further costly
    litigation in Ontario to protect his <i>Charter</i> rights.  It strikes me
    as highly unusual and highly burdensome that the appellant should be required
    to litigate his claim twice, before two different courts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    related unusual feature of the case is that the Ontario Crown was put on
    notice by the B.C. judge that there were problems with the O.P.P warrant.  The
    application judge declined to make a finding of Crown misconduct or bad faith,
    but he also found that on the known and ascertainable facts, the Ontario
    Crown should have concluded that the search warrant would likely be quashed.  The
    letter from the B.C. Crown, written at Catliff J.’s direction, expressed
    the concerns of the judge seized with the B.C. proceedings that the O.P.P.
    warrant had been obtained on the basis of misrepresentation and nondisclosure
    regarding the B.C. proceedings.  The application judge found that upon receipt
    of this letter, the Ontario Crown could have done more: “That information
    together with some further investigation by the Ontario authorities should
    have led them to conclude that there was a probability the warrant would
    be quashed.” The Crown seeks to undermine that finding on appeal, but in
    my view it is entitled to the same deference as the application judge’s finding
    that there was no misconduct on the part of the Crown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown took what in my view could appropriately be described as a “hardball” attitude
    towards the appellant and his <i>Charter</i> rights.  I recognize that the
    source of the problem was the cavalier and reckless behaviour of the B.C.
    officer who was not subject to the control of the Ontario Crown.  However,
    despite a clear warning that there were serious problems with the information
    provided by the B.C. officer, the Ontario Crown decided to tough it out.  The
    Crown’s conduct in the Ontario proceedings has been found to fall short of
    misconduct sufficient to warrant a costs award on the traditional criminal
    law test, and I do not say that costs would be appropriate if the appellant’s
    claim rested solely on the manner in which the Crown conducted this case.
    However, the decision of the Crown staunchly to resist the application to
    quash the warrant in the face of the clear warning from the B.C. Crown that
    the information was tainted provides an additional factor which, together
    with the other circumstances discussed above, makes it “appropriate and just” to
    require the Crown to indemnify the appellant for a reasonable portion of
    the costs he incurred to secure his <i>Charter</i> rights.</p>

    to his limited means, the appellant had only actually paid $26,450 and that
    there was a further $1,600 outstanding. In my view, an appropriate award
    of costs in favour of the appellant would be $20,000.</p>
