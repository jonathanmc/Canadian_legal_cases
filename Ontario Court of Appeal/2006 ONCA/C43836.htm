  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the October 10,
    2004 decision of Justice Roydon J. Kealey dismissing the summary conviction
    appeal from the finding of guilt entered by Justice Beaman of the Ontario Court
    of Justice on December 5, 2002.</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'> </span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:
normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was found guilty by Justice Beaman of the
    Ontario Court of Justice of two counts of assault and two counts of uttering
    threats against his wife.  His
    conviction appeal was dismissed by the summary conviction appeal court judge
    although his sentence appeal was allowed varying the sentence to a conditional
    discharge.  The appellant now seeks
    leave to appeal his finding of guilt and, if granted, appeals to this court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the summary conviction appeal court
    judge erred in law by failing to find that the trial judge had misapprehended
    or failed to consider critical evidence to the detriment of the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues, in effect, that several pieces of
    evidence must have been ignored or misunderstood by the trial judge for her to
    have found him guilty.  Specifically,
    the appellant says that the trial judge accepted evidence of discreditable
    conduct but did not consider evidence of witnesses other than the complainant
    that conflicted with the complainant’s description of various incidents and of
    her relationship with the appellant.  Further, the appellant argues that the trial judge misapprehended the
    evidence in failing to appreciate the importance of the numerous
    inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence as well as the fact that the
    complainant had a motive to fabricate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the issues raised relate essentially to findings of
    fact, the appellant’s position in this court is that the trial judgment is
    unreasonable and, as a result, the summary conviction appeal court judge’s
    failure to allow the appeal was an error of law.  The appellant submits that the summary conviction appeal court
    judge ought to have found that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence and
    ought to have allowed the appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown argues in its factum and submissions that this case
    essentially turned on the assessment of the complainant’s credibility.  The appellant did not testify at trial and,
    as a result, the complainant’s evidence was essentially uncontroverted.  It is apparent from the trial judge’s
    reasons that she considered all of the inconsistencies in the complainant’s
    evidence and was alive to the suggestion that the complainant may have reason
    to fabricate evidence.  The trial
    judge’s finding that the complainant was credible and the trial judge’s
    acceptance of the complainant’s evidence are to be afforded deference.  Once accepted, this evidence, together with
    the balance of the record provided ample support for a finding of guilt on all
    four counts. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown also argues that the reasons of the trial judge are
    thorough and her failure to address in her reasons every piece of evidence led
    over the course of this five-day trial does not constitute an error.  Read as a whole, the reasons indicate that
    she properly assessed the evidence that was led at trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the position of the Crown and find no basis to
    interfere with the judgment on appeal.  As stated by the summary conviction appeal court judge: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>The
    trial judge gave detailed reasons for her decision, some twenty-five pages in
    length.  The charges before her arose in
    the context of domestic relations with the complainant wife and the accused
    husband.  From the record, it is
    exceedingly clear that the trial judge properly admitted and utilized the
    evidence of prior disreputable conduct, was alive to the inconsistencies in the
    complainant’s testimony, some of which she discussed in her reasons and appears
    to have dealt with the issue of ‘animus’ as presented at trial.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Despite the able argument of counsel for the
    appellant, there is no basis for concluding that the evidence at trial was not
    reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge’s determination of the
    offences she tried.  Furthermore, in a
    case such as this where credibility is a key factor in the prosecution, great
    deference must be accorded to the trier.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In conclusion, therefore, leave to appeal is granted but the
    appeal is dismissed.</p>
