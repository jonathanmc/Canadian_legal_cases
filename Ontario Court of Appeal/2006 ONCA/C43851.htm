  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>LaFORME J.A.:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals from a decision <span lang=EN-US>of the Superior Court
    of Justice dismissing her civil action against the Respondents – Dr. Sawadsky
    and Sunnybrook Hospital.  </span>The action arose because the appellant had
    been detained at Sunnybrook for a psychiatric assessment under the <i>Mental
    Health Act</i>, <span lang=EN-US>R.S.O., 1990, c. M.7 (“<i>MHA</i>”)</span>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    at Sunnybrook, Dr. Sawadsky<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a> examined
    the appellant and applied for a psychiatric assessment, ordering her detention
    for up to 72 hours.  She was assessed and released, all within four and one-half
    hours.  There was a follow-up appointment three days later, which the appellant
    attended.  She did not attend a further appointment.  Doctors diagnosed the
    appellant as suffering from paranoid delusions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant brought an action against Dr. Sawadsky and Sunnybrook claiming
    the detention was unlawful and seeking damages for false imprisonment and
    various <i>Charter </i>breaches.  The trial judge dismissed the action, finding
    that the detention was <span lang=EN-US>lawful since Sunnybrook and Dr Sawadsky
    had complied with the applicable provisions of the <i>MHA</i>.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge also dismissed the appellant’s <i>Charter</i> challenge to
      the <i>MHA</i>, finding that the <i>Charter</i> does not extend the same
      level of procedural protections to people brought to a hospital pursuant
      to the <i>MHA</i> as to those being criminally investigated by police. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also filed an amended Notice of Constitutional Question on the
    appeal, challenging the constitutional validity of the <i>MHA</i>.  The Attorney
    General for Ontario intervenes pursuant to s. 109(5) of the <i>Courts of
    Justice Act</i>.  However, the appellant abandoned this issue in oral argument. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the following reasons, I conclude that this appeal must be dismissed.  The
    trial judge was correct in holding that the appellant’s right to counsel
    was not violated by the provision of a written notice of her right to counsel.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    May 22, 2003, at the request of the appellant’s daughter, a Justice of the
    Peace issued a Form 2 under s. 16 of the <i>MHA</i>.<i> </i> Acting under
    the authority of the Form 2, police officers attended at the appellant’s
    home in the early afternoon of May 26, 2003, took custody of the appellant
    and escorted her to Sunnybrook for examination by a physician. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was registered at emergency at around 1:30 pm.  Dr. Sawadsky examined
    the appellant at around 4:00 pm, and at 4:30 pm, he detained her under a
    Form 1 for further assessment.  Another doctor examined the appellant at
    around 5:30 or 6:00 pm and released her under s. 20(1) of the <i>MHA</i>.  The
    appellant was told she was free to go but was asked to return three days
    later for a follow up appointment.  She returned to Sunnybrook on May 29
    at around 1:30 pm, and was examined. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Form 1 completed by Dr. Sawadsky authorized the detention of the appellant
    for up to seventy-two hours.  When a Form 1 is executed, the <i>MHA</i> requires
    the attending physician to provide the patient with written notice of the
    application for psychiatric assessment, including the reasons for the detention
    and the individual’s right to retain and instruct counsel without delay.  It
    is common practice to use a Form 42 to provide that notice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Sawadsky testified at trial that although he had no specific recollection
    of giving the appellant a Form 42, he believes that he did, based on his
    routine practice of doing so and his obligations to his patient.  The appellant
    testified that she did not receive the Form 42.  She also testified that
    she felt compelled to return for the follow up appointment on May 29.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issues raised by the appellant in this appeal amount to the following two
    assertions:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1. The trial judge erred in finding that the detention
    of the appellant was not unlawful; and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2. Dr. Sawadsky and Sunnybrook violated several
    of the appellant’s <i>Charter</i> rights, namely ss. 7, 8, 9 and 10(a), (b)
    and (c).</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where,
    as in this case, the examining physician concludes that a psychiatric assessment
    is warranted, s.  38.1 of the <i>MHA </i>requires that written notice of
    the right to counsel be given to the patient:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b><span lang=EN>38.1(1)&#8194;</span></b><span lang=EN>The
      attending physician of a person&#8194;who is the subject of an application
      for assessment under section 15…shall promptly give the person a written
      notice of the application or order.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) The notice shall state the reasons for the
    detention and shall indicate that the person has the right to retain and
    instruct counsel without delay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    already noted, the common practice is to use a Form 42 to provide that notice.  A
    Form 42 is a two-page document that includes the sentence: “You have the
    right to retain and instruct a lawyer without delay”.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>(i)            Unlawful
        Detention</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that the appellant’s detention on May 26, 2004, under
    the <i>MHA </i>was lawful. The appellant argued that the trial judge erred
    in doing so.  In support of her conclusion she made the following findings
    of fact:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the circumstances, the appellant was seen
    “forthwith” by Dr. Sawadsky; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was given the Form 42 required by the <i>MHA</i>;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was notified “promptly” of the decision to detain the appellant
    for psychiatric assessment; and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Upon
    her release on May 26, the appellant was invited to return for a further
    examination but was not detained beyond the initial psychiatric assessment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    effect of those findings is that the respondents complied with the material
    parts of the <i>MHA</i>.  Unless the trial judge made palpable and overriding
    errors in arriving at those findings, the appellant’s argument that the detention
    was unlawful must fail.  She did not, and I can find no basis upon which
    to interfere with the findings of fact made by the trial judge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence before the trial judge was that Dr. Sawadsky saw the appellant two
    and one-half hours after she arrived at Sunnybrook.  The events took place
    in a busy emergency room during the SARS crisis in Toronto.  Dr. Sawadsky
    also testified that patients brought into the emergency room under the <i>MHA </i>are
    a priority.  It was open to the trial judge to conclude, in these circumstances,
    that the examination took place “forthwith”, as required by s. 18 of the <i>MHA</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence of the appellant and Dr. Sawadsky conflicted as to whether or not
    the appellant was given a Form 42.  The trial judge made credibility assessments
    and favoured the evidence of Dr. Sawadsky.  She was entitled to do so and
    preferred the evidence of Dr. Sawadsky to that of the appellant.  The trial
    judge accepted Dr. Sawadsky’s belief that based on his usual practice and
    his obligations to his patients; he gave the appellant the Form 42.  Her
    conclusion that the appellant received the Form 42 was reasonable and supported
    by the evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Upon
    determining that an application for an assessment was necessary, Dr. Sawadsky
    was required by s. 38.1 of the <i>MHA</i> to notify the appellant “promptly” of
    the detention.  The evidence at trial was that Dr. Sawadsky examined the
    appellant by 4:00 pm and he gave her the Form 42 notifying her of the detention
    immediately after completing the Form 1, at about 4:30 pm.  Again, the conclusion
    that the appellant was notified “promptly” was available to the trial judge
    on the evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    to the length of the detention, I again find no basis for interfering with
    the trial judge’s findings.  The appellant testified that she felt compelled
    to return for a follow up examination on May 29, 2003.  However, considering
    the evidence in its totality, including the evidence of the nurse who arranged
    a taxi ride home for the appellant after the examination on May 26, the trial
    judge found that it was not reasonable for the appellant to have felt that
    she was under a compulsion to return three days later.  I would not interfere
    with the finding that the detention did not continue beyond the initial assessment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the trial judge did not err in holding that the respondents complied
    with the <i>MHA</i>.  The appellant’s arguments that the detention was unlawful
    cannot succeed.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>(ii)            Charter</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    remaining grounds of appeal relate to alleged violations of ss. 7, 8, 9,
    and 10(a), (b) and (c) of the <i>Charter</i>.  Given my conclusion that the
    appellant was not unlawfully detained under the <i>MHA</i>, the appellant’s
    arguments based on ss. 9 and 10(c) of the <i>Charter</i> must also fail. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am unable to agree with the appellant that there was a violation of her right
    against unreasonable search and seizure guaranteed by s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.  The
    questions put to the appellant by Dr. Sawadsky in his examination of her
    under the authority of the Form 2 did not constitute a search or seizure.  There
    was no expectation of privacy between the appellant and the doctors, and
    the questioning was not unreasonable in the circumstances.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the trial judge that the appellant was informed promptly of the
    reasons for her detention.  There is no basis therefore for finding a breach
    of s. 10(a) of the <i>Charter</i>.  This then leaves the appellant’s contention
    that there was a violation of her s. 10(b) right. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    person’s s. 10(b) right to counsel only arises upon arrest or detention.  Under
    the <i>MHA</i> scheme, and in circumstances such as those in this case, an “attending
    physician” is required to <span lang=EN>give the person a written notice
    of the order (i.e. Form 42).  Once again, Form 42 requires</span> the reasons
    for the detention and indicates that the person has the right to retain and
    instruct counsel without delay.  Aside from the requirement of the attending
    physician to give the notice, he or she is also required to assess the person
    who has originally been detained by the police.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her statement of claim, the appellant advanced two arguments in support of
    her contention that the respondents had violated her s. 10(b) <i>Charter</i> rights.  First,
    that Sunnybrook and Dr. Sawadsky were obligated to advise the appellant of
    her right to counsel immediately upon her arrival at the hospital.  And second,
    that the defendants did not comply with the requirement in the <i>MHA</i>, to
    advise the appellant in writing of her right to counsel immediately upon
    the execution of the Form 1. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the first argument, there does not appear to be any evidence as
    to what the appellant was told about her right to counsel upon her arrival
    at Sunnybrook.  However, s. 33 of <i>MHA</i> makes it clear that the appellant
    remained in the custody of the police who took her to the hospital until
    she was assessed by a physician.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    police are not a party to these proceedings.  The appellant has not alleged
    that they did not comply with their obligations under s. 10(b), and there
    is no evidence as to what, if anything, the police did to advise the appellant
    of her right to counsel or facilitate contact with counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    appears from the trial judge’s reasons that a submission was made that the
    defendants had the same s. 10(b) obligation to the appellant that police
    officers have to those detained in the criminal law context.  For example,
    counsel argues that Dr. Sawadsky and Sunnybrook were obligated, like police
    officers, to tell the plaintiff that she had the right to access free legal
    advice over the telephone. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that the <i>Charter </i>requirement for criminal purposes
    - that police must orally inform a detainee of the right to counsel and the
    opportunity to access free legal advice - does not apply in the circumstances
    of detention pursuant to the <i>MHA</i>.  She held that: “… the procedural

    there is certainly merit to the comprehensive analysis of the trial judge
    on this issue, respectfully, she should not have addressed it in this case.  Any
    issue as to the nature of any s. 10(b) right in this case as compared to
    that in the criminal context was not part of the pleadings and was not the
    subject matter of any evidence.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[3]</span></a>  Without proper pleadings
    and the relevant evidence, this issue should not have been considered at
    trial and cannot be properly addressed on this appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    the question of whether this appellant understood the right to counsel was
    likewise not raised in the pleadings or in the evidence.  It is not suggested
    that if she received written notice, she did not read it or could not understand
    it.  As I have previously concluded, her case on s. 10(b) stands or falls
    on the assertion that she did not get the written notice as required under
    the <i>MHA</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    fully appreciate that in the context of this case there are several difficult
    issues lurking just below the surface in connection with this issue.  All
    of these issues, and no doubt some others, depend upon the degree to which
    the mental health context requires a different configuration of the right
    to counsel than does the criminal law context.  Nevertheless, while the different
    contexts will have to be considered, if and when these issues arise, they
    simply are not properly raised in this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would, however, make one observation as to the nature of the obligation imposed
    by s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter</i> on those who detain persons for assessment
    under the <i>MHA</i>.  Section 38.1 places an obligation on the attending
    physician to provide certain documentation to the patient.  That documentation
    must include notice of the right to counsel.  Insofar as s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter</i> may
    impose additional obligations to advise patients of their right to counsel
    and/or to facilitate contact with counsel, those obligations should not be
    placed on the attending physician.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, it could do real potential harm to the doctor/patient relationship
    to impose a police-like obligation on the attending physician to advise his
    or her patient of the right to counsel and other information pertaining to
    the exercise of that right.  Therefore, to the extent that s. 10(b) may impose
    additional obligations beyond s. 38.1 of the <i>MHA</i>, those obligations
    should fall on the institution and not the attending physician.</p>

    would dismiss the appeal.  Each of Dr. Sawadsky and the Hospital are awarded
    their costs of the appeal in the amount of $15,000 inclusive of disbursements
    and GST.  The Attorney General for Ontario did not seek costs of the appeal
    and none will be ordered.</p>
