    Jarvis and the Crown appeal the sentence imposed by Bigelow J. on July 18,
    2005 for the offence contrary to s. 172.1(1)(c) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> of
    communicating with a person believed to be under the age of fourteen years
    for the purpose of facilitating the offence of invitation to sexual touching.  The
    Crown also seeks to adduce as fresh evidence various statistical studies
    and other information concerning the use of the Internet by young people.  In
    these reasons, I will refer to Mr. Jarvis as the appellant and to the s.
    172.1 offence as Internet luring.</p>

line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the conclusion of oral argument, the court announced that the application
    to adduce fresh evidence was dismissed as were both appeals with reasons
    to follow.  These are those reasons.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
      FACTS</span></h4>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
      offence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    offence in this case took place over 14 days in July 2003.  At the time,
    the appellant was 22 years of age.  He had just moved out of his parents’ home
    and was living with his then girlfriend in her apartment.  He had no prior
    criminal record and was of previous good character.  He was under some stress
    due, among other things, to his mother’s serious illness, an illness that
    unfortunately recurred at the time of sentencing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Just
    after noon on July 3, 2003, the appellant began the first of seven communications
    with an undercover police officer by entering an Internet chat room.  The
    appellant believed he was chatting with a thirteen-year old girl who identified
    herself initially as “funangel”.  Within minutes of the communication having
    begun, the appellant had sent digital photographs of his head and penis.  During
    this communication the appellant engaged in sexually suggestive talk, asked
    where the child lived and asked whether he could meet her so she could see
    his penis
    “for real”.  He told her that if they met, she could hold his penis and masturbate
    him and he could touch and rub her genital area.  About two hours into this
    chat, the appellant sent a photograph that shows him rubbing his penis.  By
    this time, he had learned that funangel’s
    “real” name was Jessie and he had given her his first name.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the ensuing six communications the appellant’s talk became more explicit.  For
    example, he offered to teach Jessie how to masturbate him and perform fellatio
    and he explained how he would perform cunnilingus on her.  There was also
    discussion about the wearing of a condom.  The appellant continually pressed
    to meet Jessie in person.  He also sent Jessie photographs of adult women
    performing fellatio on adult men.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    final communication took place on July 16 when Jessie agreed to meet the
    appellant at a park in downtown Toronto.  There was explicit conversation
    during this chat with the appellant indicating that he wanted to rub Jessie’s
    genital area.  The appellant provided his telephone number to Jessie and
    a female undercover officer called him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    noon on July 16, the appellant walked into the park after travelling almost
    20 kilometres from his girlfriend’s residence.  He was arrested as he approached
    an undercover female officer.  The appellant had a condom in his pocket and
    was not wearing underwear.  The computer and the digital camera used to take
    the photographs were found when the police searched the appellant’s girlfriend’s
    apartment.  The police did not find any child pornography on the computer
    nor any indication that the appellant had engaged in similar communications
    with other children.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant’s background</span></h4>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have said, at the time of the offence, the appellant was 22 years of age
    and of previous good character.  He had abided by all his bail conditions
    for the two years he was on bail pending trial.  Those conditions included
    that the appellant only use a computer and the Internet for work purposes
    and not be around any children under the age of sixteen years.  The appellant’s
    mother testified at the sentence hearing that the appellant had matured in
    the two years since his arrest and was now more engaged with others and not
    so isolated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    year following his arrest, the appellant saw Dr. Wright, a highly qualified
    psychologist who is an expert in assessment and treatment of sex offenders.  His
    report was filed at the sentence hearing and he testified at the sentence
    hearing.  Dr. Wright described the appellant as intelligent.  He had a relatively
    stable and prosocial lifestyle but was then overly reliant on the Internet
    to meet his social and sexual needs.  Testing with actuarial psychological
    instruments showed the appellant as being at low risk to re-offend and an
    excellent candidate for supervision within the community.  However, Dr.&nbsp;Wright
    was also of the view that the appellant is a hebephile, in that he is attracted
    to female adolescents.  Although the appellant was unlikely to re-offend,
    he would benefit from counselling to
    “increase his quality of life and adjustment”.  Dr. Wright expressed some
    concern about how the appellant would react if again put under stress and
    so he thought it prudent that the appellant take relapse prevention therapy
    to deal with his apparent attraction to older children.  He also thought
    it prudent to monitor the appellant when he was around children.  Dr. Wright
    testified that the treatment the appellant could obtain out of custody while
    on a conditional sentence would be superior to the treatment in a provincial
    institution.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The

line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Wright testified that the appellant told him he did not intend to have any
    sexual contact with “Jessie” when he went to the park.  Dr. Wright felt that
    the appellant had been remarkably candid with him and for that and other
    reasons he accepted the appellant’s statement.  The trial judge rejected
    this evidence and drew the inference that the appellant did intend to have
    sexual contact with the child.  The trial judge relied upon the facts that
    the appellant had a condom with him and was not wearing any underwear.  He
    considered alternative explanations for this behaviour as “pure speculation”.</p>

line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, Crown counsel sought to file an excerpt from Hansard that included
    the Minister’s statement at second reading of Bill C-15 that enacted the
    Internet-luring offence.  Crown counsel also sought to file excerpts from
    the executive summary of <i>Young Canadians in a Wired World:  The Students’ View</i>,
    October 2001.  The survey was prepared by Environics Research Group for the
    Media Awareness Network and Government of Canada. Crown counsel stated that
    she relied upon the <i>Wired World</i> excerpt for two purposes.  First,
    to show the material that was before the court in <i>R. v. Carratt</i>, [2005]
    A.J. No. 743 (Prov. Ct.), a case relied upon by Crown counsel.  Second, Crown
    counsel stated that she relied upon the report “to put some numbers to this
    common sense proposition that our children are using the Internet frequently,
    and, so … what this survey does is just give some numbers to what I would
    refer to are common sense propositions”.  Crown counsel specifically wanted
    to refer to statistics showing that:</p>

    counsel indicated that “those are, really, only the figures that I would
    like to refer to and, again, … my argument will be, really, that we’re just
    quantifying what our common sense would tell us”.  Defence counsel objected
    to admissibility of the survey because he would not be able to cross-examine
    the author.  In addition to the statistics referred to by Crown counsel in
    her submissions at trial, the executive summary also includes other information
    such as information about monitoring by parents of Internet usage.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge refused to admit the <i>Wired World</i> survey.  He stated that
    he would find it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from the statistics
    without a witness to explain their import.  While he was prepared to take
    judicial notice “that children use things like chat rooms”, he was not willing,
    without more evidence, “to get into the issues of what those may be, whether
    or not they are controlled by individual children, whether they are open
    to the public, all of that”.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    seems that the trial judge also refused to admit the Hansard excerpt.  However,
    he was prepared to take judicial notice of the issues addressed by the Minister
    in her statement to the House, namely, the rationale for the legislation,
    the concern for safety of children, and the challenge in dealing with this
    new technology.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, Crown counsel, who was not counsel at trial, sought to introduce
    a broad range of material concerning Internet use by children.  This material
    included the 2005 version of the <i>Wired World</i> survey and not just the
    executive summary but the entire report, material from the Canadian Centre
    for Justice Statistics concerning the number of children who were victims
    of violent crime in 2003, information published by Media Awareness Network,
    and sponsored by Bell and Microsoft as part of the <i>Be Web Aware</i> project
    and testimony from hearings before the U.S. Congress concerning Internet
    predators.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    test for fresh evidence on a sentence appeal is similar to the test for fresh
    evidence generally as explained by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v.
    Levesque</i> (2000), 148 C.C.C. (3d) 193.  Generally, the test tends to be
    applied somewhat less rigorously on sentence appeals. However, where it is
    the Crown that seeks to introduce fresh evidence on its sentence appeal,
    it is appropriate to pay special attention to the due diligence requirement.  It
    is problematic to ask a court to increase a sentence many months after the
    sentence was initially imposed on the basis of material that could have been
    produced before the trial judge.  In <i>R. v. Levo</i> (1996), 105 C.C.C.
    (3d) 21 at 32, this court emphasized the undesirability of the prosecution
    placing this kind of material before the appeal court for the first time.  In
    that case, Finlayson J.A. also raised a concern about “simply [placing] on
    the record articles and studies that were intended for a different and wider
    audience” such as the general public or a parliamentary committee.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Much
    of the material sought to be admitted in this court could have been placed
    before the trial judge.  Admittedly, the more recent version of the <i>Wired
    World</i> report was likely not available.  But, had trial counsel considered
    it advisable to do so, she could have adduced the entire 2001 report.  I
    do not criticize trial counsel for not having done so.  She likely did not
    want to clutter the record with a very lengthy report when the executive
    summary would make her point.  But, having made that tactical decision, the
    Crown should not now be able to revisit the matter on appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    material from the United States Congress falls into a different category
    as most of it postdates the sentencing in this matter.  However, it is inadmissible
    as fresh evidence because it would not have affected the result.  It consists
    in part of anecdotal material that may be of interest to legislators but
    is not sufficiently precise to assist a court in sentencing an individual.  Finally,
    there is material consisting of the United States versions of the <i>Wired
    World</i> report and United States justice statistics.  It is not appropriate
    to permit the Crown, having failed to adduce Canadian material of this nature
    at trial, to avoid the due diligence requirements by allowing it to adduce
    material of less relevance to a Canadian court from another country.</p>

    Crown submits that the trial judge erred in failing to admit the <i>Wired
    World </i>material.  As I understand it, the Crown does not complain about
    the refusal to admit the Hansard excerpt.  In any event, the trial judge
    said that he was taking judicial notice of the contents of the Minister’s
    Statement as recorded in Hansard.  His refusal to admit the actual document
    was of no moment.</p>

line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this record, the trial judge did not err in refusing to admit the <i>Wired
    World</i> executive summary.  Crown counsel sought to introduce this evidence
    for two reasons.  First, to explain the material that was before the trial
    judge in a trial decision from Alberta.  I have read the decision in question, <i>R.
    v. Carrant.</i>  The reasons of the trial judge in that case would have been
    of limited assistance to the trial judge in this case.  The report of the
    reasons contains few facts about the offence, or the offender, and the only
    reference to <i>Wired World</i>, is that the judge found the document “helpful
    and informative” (para. 12).  There is no indication what use the judge made
    of the document.  In my view, this first reason provided by Crown counsel
    at trial was not a sufficient reason to admit <i>Wired World</i> for its
    truth.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second reason provided by Crown counsel at trial was to support what she
    considered to be common sense notions of Internet usage by adolescents.  I
    take this to mean that Crown counsel wished to place before the trial judge
    legislative facts or what are sometimes referred to as contextual facts.  (See
    the discussion in Hill <i>et al</i>., <i>McWilliams Canadian Criminal Evidence</i> (looseleaf)
    (4<sup>th</sup> ed.) (Aurora: Canada Law Book, 2003) at §23.40).  Defence
    counsel objected to admissibility of the document because he would not have
    an opportunity to cross-examine the author.  I agree with the Crown that
    this was not a sufficient basis to refuse to admit the evidence.  I do not,
    however, read the trial judge’s ruling as refusing to admit the document
    because Crown counsel did not intend to produce the author of the report.  Rather,
    the trial judge was concerned about the form in which the evidence was presented
    to him.  I have summarized his reasons above; he stated that he would have
    difficulty drawing any meaningful conclusions from the material without the
    assistance of a witness to explain it.  In my view, it was within the trial
    judge’s discretion to refuse to admit the evidence in the form in which it
    was presented.  He was given only the executive summary and provided with
    no information about the methodology used in the survey or the purpose for
    which it was commissioned.  If the trial judge would not have found the information
    useful in the form in which it was presented, there was no reason for him
    to admit it.  Crown counsel was not required to produce the author of the
    report but she did have an obligation to produce the material in a manner
    that the trial judge would find meaningful, for example, by calling an expert
    witness familiar with the report.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    the Crown was not seriously prejudiced by the trial judge’s refusal to admit
    the document.  The trial judge recognized the seriousness of the offence
    and the mischief to which the legislation is directed.  He took judicial
    notice of the pervasiveness of the Internet and that children can access
    chat rooms.  He also noted the “significant concern about safety of children,
    about children being harmed” and “the dangers that exist as a result of this
    new technology”.  In his reasons for sentence, the trial judge also relied
    upon the decision of Ratushny J. in <i>R. v. Jepson</i>, [2004] O.J. No.
    5521 (Sup. Ct.) and he quoted from para. 19 of her reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Denunciation,
    deterrence, both general and specific, and rehabilitation are the objectives
    to be served in sentencing Mr. Jepson, in that order.  <i>Child luring over
    the internet requires strong denunciation because of the ease with which
    offenders can prey on innocent children, out of the reach of the public eye</i>.  The
    consequences can be catastrophic, especially where, as here, the sexually
    explicit talk progresses past the fantasy talk to a face-to-face meeting
    where the risk of physical sexual offences being committed becomes a more
    real risk. [Emphasis added.]</p>

line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Jepson </i>decision
    accurately identifies the seriousness of the offence and the appropriate
    approach to sentencing. The <i>Wired World</i> report would not have materially
    changed the trial judge’s approach.</p>

    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in failing to accept Dr. Wright’s “uncontradicted
    expert opinion” that the appellant would not have acted out in the park.  The
    trial judge was not bound to accept Dr. Wright’s opinion.  He had to draw
    his own conclusions from all the information placed before him and the evidence
    he accepted.  Given the appellant’s attraction to adolescent females, the
    explicit nature of the numerous communications with
    “Jessie”, his stated intention to perform sexual acts with her, and that
    he actually went to the park, not wearing underwear and with a condom, the
    trial judge could reasonably draw the inference that the appellant intended
    to perform some form of sexual act with the child, if given the opportunity.  From
    reading Dr. Wright’s report and evidence, I think it reasonable to conclude
    that the appellant would not have used physical force against the child.  But,
    the trial judge could easily conclude that the appellant was not simply using
    the Internet to indulge his fantasies but was grooming “Jessie” so that he
    would not have to use force.  I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>

    trial judge imposed a sentence of six months imprisonment, three years probation
    and made an order under s. 161 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> for ten years.  On
    appeal, the Crown submits that the six-month sentence is inadequate, while

    will deal first with the appellant’s appeal.  In my view, a conditional sentence
    will generally be inappropriate for an offence of the nature committed by
    the appellant in this case.  Given the degree of planning implicit in the
    offence and the seriousness of the conduct contemplated, the objectives of
    general deterrence and denunciation will rarely be satisfied by a conditional
    sentence of imprisonment.  This offence is not committed simply through communication
    with a child, even communication of a sexual nature.  The Crown must also
    prove that the offender communicated with the child, or a person he believed
    to be a child, for the purpose of facilitating commission of a serious sexual
    offence such as invitation to sexual touching, an offence which if committed
    a conditional sentence is not available.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a>  Moreover,
    this accused committed the most serious form of the offence as described
    in s. 172.1(1)(c); he communicated with someone he believed to be under fourteen
    years of age.  </p>

    appellant relies upon this court’s decision in <i>R. v. Folino</i> (2005),
    202 C.C.C. (3d) 353 where the court varied a nine-month sentence of imprisonment
    to a conditional sentence.  The circumstances of that case, however, were
    exceptional.  The appellant did not suffer from pedophilia or hebephilia
    but was suffering from a major depressive illness at the time of the offence.  He
    remained in a fragile mental and physical state at the time of the appeal
    and there was a significant risk of suicide if he was returned to jail.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    paragraph 25 of the reasons of the court in <i>Folino</i>, McMurtry C.J.O.
    emphasized the seriousness of this offence and the limited circumstances
    in which a conditional sentence could be imposed:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Having come
    to this conclusion, I wish to first make it clear that I fully agree with
    the sentencing judge that the offence of child luring must be dealt with
    seriously by the courts. The social policy underlying the enactment of this
    offence is clear. Many Canadian families have home computers with Internet
    access. Children are frequent users of the Internet. Children, as vulnerable
    members of our society, must be safeguarded against predators who abuse the
    Internet to lure children into situations where they can be sexually exploited
    and abused. In most circumstances involving the offence of child luring,
    the sentencing goals of denunciation and deterrence will require a sentence
    of institutional incarceration. <i>Indeed, it will only be in the rarest
    of cases that a conditional sentence will be appropriate in a case involving
    this offence</i>. In my view, however, this is one of those rare cases. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the trial judge gave full consideration to the various mitigating
    factors and serious consideration to a conditional sentence.  He did not
    err in imposing a custodial sentence. For this reason, we did not give effect
    to the appellant’s appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    to the Crown appeal, while I consider the sentence imposed by the trial judge
    to be a lenient one, I cannot say that the sentence is manifestly inadequate
    or that the trial judge erred in principle.  The decisions of trial courts
    that were placed before us suggest that the range of sentence for this offence
    generally lies between twelve months and two years.  Circumstances such as
    possession of child pornography or a record for other child sexual offences
    will require a sentence at the upper end of this range.  Obviously, if the
    offender has previously committed the same offence, an even longer sentence
    may be required.  The trial judge recognized that he was imposing a sentence
    below the usual range, but he had in mind a number of mitigating factors
    and the absence of any serious aggravating circumstances.  He took particular
    note of the appellant’s relative youth and the impact of incarceration on
    his family.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a>  He referred at some length to <i>R.
    v. Jepson</i>, where Ratushny J. imposed a sentence of 12 months imprisonment
    in circumstances not unlike this case.  But, as the trial judge noted, in <i>Jepson</i>,
    the offender was also found in possession of child pornography. Accordingly,
    we did not give effect to the Crown appeal.</p>
