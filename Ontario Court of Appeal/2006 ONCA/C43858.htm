  <h2 style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:13.0pt;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>On
      appeal from the judgment of Justice R. Echlin of the Superior Court of
      Justice dated June 10, 2005.</span></h2>
  <h2>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, this appeal must be dismissed for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    on our reading of his reasons, the trial judge did not fail to recognize,
    nor did he reject, the proposition that an employer enjoys the authority
    to impose reasonable employee discipline short of termination of employment
    in a proper case.  To the contrary, the trial judge expressly directed himself
    concerning the principles enunciated in <i>McKinley v. B.C. Tel</i>, [2001]
    2 S.C.R. 161, including the principle that disciplinary measures short of
    dismissal may be appropriate for less serious types of employee misconduct.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the absence of a specific agreement between the parties regarding employer-initiated
    suspensions, the issue before the trial judge was whether an implied term
    authorizing unpaid suspensions should be read into the employment relationship
    between the parties.  The trial judge concluded that it should not.  In our
    opinion, he did not err in so holding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    historical discipline of the employee did not include unpaid suspensions
    from work of uncertain duration.  In addition, the suspension at issue was
    inconsistent with the rehabilitative and progressive disciplinary measures
    contemplated under the employer’s human resources policies.  As well, the
    trial judge found that the imposition of the proposed term was unnecessary
    to ensure the business efficacy of the employment relationship.  That finding
    was open to the trial judge on the evidence in this case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    do we accept the appellant’s submission that the trial judge erred by failing
    to hold that the discipline imposed was proportionate and reasonable.  The
    trial judge made the following critical factual findings:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)        the respondent was suspended without
    pay indefinitely; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)       the respondent was not told of the duration
    of the sus-pension or whether her salary would be continued; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii)     the suspension was the result of what
    the trial judge considered to be an “<i>ad hoc</i>/knee jerk reaction” by
    an angered chief executive officer; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iv)      the additional sanctions imposed in the
    form of the indefinite demotion of the respondent were “punitive” in nature, “mean-spirited
    and designed to humiliate” the respondent, and intended to punish and embarrass
    the respondent in the workplace.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    factual findings, which were supported by the evidence, are dispositive of
    this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    we are not persuaded that the trial judge erred in his application of the
    governing legal principles to the facts of this case or that he failed to
    consider the entire context of the employment relationship.  In our opinion,
    these contentions are simply not supported by this record.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge considered the actions of the employer, the course and history
    of the employment relationship and the employee’s conduct throughout that
    relationship.  Although the employee’s challenged actions, including her
    dealings with the chief executive officer of the appellant company, were
    less than laudable, the trial judge concluded that her conduct, viewed objectively,
    did not afford just cause for dismissal and that, in the circumstances, she
    had been constructively dismissed.  We agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is dismissed.  The respondent is entitled to her costs of the
    appeal on the partial indemnity scale, fixed in the amount of $12,000, inclusive
    of disbursements and GST.</p>
