style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant applies for judicial review of the June 30, 2005 decision of the
    Minister of Justice to surrender the applicant to the Czech Republic to face
    charges relating to production and possession of methamphetamine.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Minister issued an Authority to Proceed under the <i>Extradition Act</i> on
    November 7, 2002.  On September 30, 2004, the applicant consented to committal
    on all charges listed in the Authority to Proceed.  He was subsequently committed
    on October 18, 2004.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the applicant consented to a committal order, he opposed his surrender on
    several grounds.  The applicant’s submissions to the Minister can be summarized
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent align=left style='text-align:
left;line-height:normal'>1.         surrender would amount to an abuse of process
    in light of the following circumstances:</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;
'>(a)  he was given immunity as a police informer and agent;</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;
'>(b)  the underlying charges and the extradition request are motivated by a
    property dispute between his family and corrupt senior Czech police officials;
    and</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;
'>(c)  because of irregularities in the investigation process, the inherent unreliability
    of the evidence supporting the extradition request and the failure of Czech
    authorities to question Czech drug investigators about these charges, it
    is apparent that he would not receive a fair trial;</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent align=left style='text-align:
left;line-height:normal'>2.         surrender would be inappropriate because
    police corruption is a serious problem in the Czech Republic and would preclude
    him from receiving a fair trial; and </p>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent align=left style='text-align:
left;line-height:normal'>3.         surrender should be refused because, if he
    is extradited, he would remain in custody for a lengthy period while this
    matter is dealt with and his life would be at risk because of his status
    as a police informant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    a letter dated June 30, 2005, the Minister rejected the applicant’s submissions
    and ordered that he be surrendered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    oral argument, the applicant abandoned two of the four grounds for judicial
    review raised in his factum.  His submissions, therefore, focused on the
    allegations that:</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;
'>1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the Minister
    addressed the concerns raised by the applicant only in the context of a s.
    7 <i>Charter </i>breach and erred by failing to advert, specifically, to
    the test for refusing surrender under s. 44 of the <i>Extradition Act</i>;
    and </p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;
'>2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the Minister
    erred by setting too high a threshold for what could constitute a breach
    of fundamental justice.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant therefore submits that it is necessary that this matter be remitted
    to the Minister for reconsideration in accordance with the proper tests.  He
    contends that both grounds of review advanced if established, would constitute
    errors of law and, therefore, the standard of review is correctness</p>

      the outset of his letter, the Minister correctly set out that his discretion “to

      the United Kingdom and Czechoslovakia for the Extradition of Criminals</i>,

      could not get a fair trial in the Czech Republic; on the contrary, the
      Czech authorities demonstrated good faith and had been responsive to the
      applicant’s concerns.  The Czech authorities provided confirmation of the
      applicant having co-operated with the police in drug investigations.  Whether
      the impugned actions underlying the extradition request were committed
      to assist Czech police in their investigation and whether the applicant

      reached the factual conclusions referred to above, the Minister stated:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>In conclusion, I am of the view that none of the circumstances which
      you raise, either individually or cumulatively, would lead to a determination
      that Mr. Hajnis’ surrender to the Czech Republic would be “shocking or
      fundamentally unacceptable to our society,” or that his circumstances are
      such that they “constitutionally vitiate an order of surrender.” [<i>Kindler,
      supra</i>].  I have also determined that there are no other considerations
      that would warrant ignoring Canada’s obligations under the Treaty.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      our view, it is apparent from the Minister’s letter that in assessing the
      applicant’s submission, the Minister analyzed the circumstances of this
      case, drew certain factual conclusions and then assessed whether those
      conclusions could support a claim that the principles of fundamental justice
      would be breached if he were to order surrender of the applicant.  The
      factual conclusions are well founded and addressed all of the issues raised.  These
      conclusions make it clear that the Minister considered that the threshold
      for establishing an abuse of process had not been met and that there would
      be no unfairness in requiring that the applicant’s claims be dealt with
      as a matter of defence in the Czech Republic.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      the last portion of his conclusion, the Minister said that he had “determined
      that there are no other considerations that would warrant ignoring Canada’s
      obligations under the Treaty”.  We agree that it would have been preferable
      for the Minister to have made specific reference to the test under s.&nbsp;44
      of the <i>Extradition Act</i>.  However, in light of the factual conclusions
      that he reached and reading the letter as a whole, we understand this statement
      to reflect his conclusion that there was nothing in the record before him
      to trigger a refusal to surrender either pursuant to the <i>Charter </i>or
      s. 44 of the <i>Extradition Act</i>.  Even assuming that a failure to refer
      to the specific test under s. 44 of the Extradition Act was an error, we
      would nonetheless refuse to grant the relief sought.  Given the Minister’s
      factual findings, his failure to refer to the s.44 test did not affect
      the outcome and no risk of a miscarriage of justice has occurred.</span></p>

        of Canada recognized that the terminology “shocks the conscience” is
        in some sense a shorthanded way of describing conduct that breaches principles
        of fundamental justice.  However, the court also stated that the use
        of this terminology must not be allowed to undermine the principle that
        the test to be applied is whether there has been a breach of the principles
        of fundamental justice.</span></p>

      our view, in this case, the Minister used the “shock the conscience” language

      a more fulsome expression of the test would have been preferable, after
      reviewing the Minister’s letter as a whole, we are not satisfied that,
