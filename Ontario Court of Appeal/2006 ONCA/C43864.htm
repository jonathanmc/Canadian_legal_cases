      1986, the solicitor was retained by the client to commence an action for
      medical malpractice. In early 2000, the client dismissed the solicitor
      and retained the services of another counsel. At that time, the solicitor
      issued an account for $17,178.42 for services rendered. The account was
      reduced by an Assessment Officer to $9,900. According to the solicitor,
      the account was reduced because of a minor reduction on the hourly fee
      and the client was given credit for what she had already paid. It was not
      clear why credit had not already been indicated on the account in relation
      to what the client had already paid.  The account was further reduced on
      appeal by McGarry J. to $5,759.81, less costs of $1,000 granted to the
      client for a net amount owing to the solicitor of $4,757.81. The solicitor
      appealed to the Divisional Court.</span></p>

      before the beginning of trial in the malpractice action, counsel of record
      for the client had himself removed from the record. At the client’s request,
      the solicitor agreed to represent her in the upcoming trial. In return,
      he required the client to give him a $25,000 mortgage on her Brant Street
      property. He also required the client to sign Minutes of Settlement of
      his appeal to the Divisional Court, thereby consenting to set aside the
      order of McGarry J. and confirming the balance owed to the solicitor on
      the previous bill of costs at $9,000.</span></p>

      after the trial began, the client granted another mortgage to the solicitor.
      This mortgage was for $15,000 on her Gardenvale Road property. The solicitor

      would not show up in court the next day.         </span></p>

      reduced on assessment to $30,386.03 and confirmed at that amount by Lalonde
      J. The solicitor issued a final bill to the client in the amount of $3,356.89
      for work done after the trial in respect of an appeal of the judgment that
      did not proceed. This account was reduced on assessment to $2,904.59.</span></p>

      the solicitor from pursuing the power of sale proceedings on the condition
      that the client pay $15,000 to the solicitor and $25,000 into court to

      detailed reasons, the trial judge reviewed the positions of the parties.  Essentially,
      the client took the position that all transactions should be set aside
      because they were conducted under duress and without proper legal advice,
      while the solicitor took the position that all steps taken by him were
      proper. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The $25,000 Brant Street mortgage</span><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge found that the $25,000 Brant Street mortgage was valid. The
      client had understood and voluntarily signed the mortgage in order to get
      the services of the solicitor for the upcoming trial. He also found that
      she was in default under this mortgage when the notice of sale was issued.
      However, the trial judge found that the notice of sale was clearly incorrect,
      as it contravened the <i>Mortgages Act, </i>R.S.O. 1990, c. M.40, and he
      set it aside.   </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Minutes of Settlement</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With
      respect to the Minutes of Settlement setting aside the order of McGarry
      J. and confirming the $9,000 account, the trial judge found that the client
      had received no legal advice. He found that the solicitor abused his position
      of trust and breached his fiduciary duty to the client in having her abandon
      her rights to  the upcoming appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge’s findings with respect to the mortgage and the Minutes of
      Settlement are not consistent.  Both the $25,000 mortgage and the Minutes
      of Settlement formed part of the retainer under which the solicitor was
      prepared to take the trial. Quite clearly, the client was under pressure.  Her
      counsel had just had himself removed from the record on the eve of trial.  The
      mortgage and her acknowledgement of the $9,000 account were a deal that
      the solicitor required to take the trial.  It was a negotiation of a retainer
      and the client could accept or refuse.  If the mortgage was valid, I see
      no reason to treat the Minutes of Settlement differently.  The solicitor
      should have received full credit for that account ($4,757.81 + $4,242.19
      = $9,000).  </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The $15,000 Gardenvale Road
      mortgage</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> With
      respect to the $15,000 Gardenvale Road mortgage, the trial judge noted
      that the solicitor had testified that the client had agreed to bring the
      amount in cash before the trial commenced and when she breached her promise,
      he requested the mortgage. The trial judge did not comment on the evidence
      that the cash was intended, at least in part, to cover the fees of an expert
      witness for the trial.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge stated that the solicitor knew or ought to have known that
      the client was not able to raise $15,000 in cash in a few days.  On this
      point, the trial judge appears to have been in error.  Although stated
      in relation to the $25,000 mortgage, the client stated in her evidence
      that she owned properties and had an income of $2,500 a month.  She confirmed
      that she had a good credit rating with the bank and could easily borrow
      money.  However, in the circumstances, this error is of no moment.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge found that the solicitor gave the client an ultimatum that
      if she did not sign the Gardenvale Road mortgage, he would not show up
      to represent her the next day, even though he knew that he was ethically
      bound to do so. The solicitor admitted to giving the ultimatum, but played
      down its seriousness by stating that the amount had been discussed before
      the trial began.  He referred to it as an error in judgment and acknowledged
      that he should have acted otherwise.  The trial judge also found that the
      client had not been advised, as part of the legal advice that she received
      on this mortgage, that the solicitor would have had to appear the next
      day whether or not she signed the mortgage.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      conclusion of the trial judge that this mortgage was null and void is well

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The steps taken by the solicitor</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge reviewed, in detail, the steps taken by the solicitor against
      the client. He found that all amounts claimed by the solicitor in the notices
      of sale were inflated and had been covered in the orders of Forget J. and
      Byers J. These amounts were also all disputed in the statement of claim
      in the present action. Nevertheless, the solicitor’s conduct in filing
      a writ of seizure and sale with respect to the $9,000 amount (on the client’s
      North Bay property) was clearly reprehensible when he knew that the Minutes
      of Settlement were being challenged and that he had been enjoined from
      proceeding on that account. The trial judge called it “sharp practice of
      the worst kind” which was intended to cause the client difficulty in properly
      prosecuting her claim against him. The solicitor had shown no remorse.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      addition, the solicitor attempted to garnishee rents after the Byers J.
      order. In his affidavit, he stated that “no payment had been made with
      respect to this judgment”, when in fact he had received the $15,000 ordered
      by Byers J. The trial judge found that the solicitor’s explanation was
      not credible and that the notices of garnishment were intended and did
      cause the client substantial difficulties. The trial judge found this conduct
      abusive and excessive.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      May 2003, the solicitor directed the sheriff to sell the Gardenvale Road
      property to satisfy the same writs and the same debts that were the subject
      matter of the present action and the interim injunction granted by Byers
      J. This led to another injunction, this one granted by Rutherford J.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge concluded his analysis in these words:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Having had the opportunity of hearing all the evidence
    in this case, I find that the defendant was well aware that the
    “spirit” of Byers J.’s order intended to put on hold generally all types
    of enforcement proceedings for those same 3 debts until the merits of the
    action were determined. Once again, the enforcement proceeding taken by the
    defendant was excessive and abusive and intended to derail the plaintiff’s
    efforts to bring this matter to trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    any one individual action of the defendant described above does not constitute
    excessive and abusive enforcement, the cumulative effect of these actions
    over a substantial period of time clearly amounts to excessive conduct. I
    find that the defendant’s conduct was malicious, oppressive and highhanded
    and warrants an award of punitive damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, except as stated above, all findings of fact and all inferences
    made by the trial judge are reasonably supported by the evidence at trial.  The
    credibility of the witnesses played an important role in this case and great
    deference must be accorded to the trial judge on that issue.  I am not persuaded
    that the trial judge made any overriding and palpable error in this case. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The accounting</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    solicitor objected to the accounting that was done by the trial judge, arguing
    that it should not have been part of this action.   I disagree.  The client
    pleaded in her statement of claim that she was asking for an accounting of
    the moneys owed under the mortgages.  Moreover, the trial judge noted in
    his reasons that it was made clear, in discussion with counsel at the opening
    of the trial, that one of the purposes of the trial was to determine the
    amount required to be paid by the client to discharge all mortgages and writs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the client owed the solicitor a total of $39,348.43
    representing his original account ($4,757.81), the trial account ($31,686.03)
    and the appeal account ($2,904.59), less the $15,000 paid to the solicitor,
    for a balance of $24,348.43. He also found that the solicitor owed to the
    client the sum of $2,000 awarded to the client in the Rutherford J. injunction.  In
    addition, he awarded the client punitive damages of $5,000 and costs on a
    substantial indemnity scale fixed at $34,906.98. The bottom line was that
    the solicitor owed the client the sum of $17,558.55.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The costs on a substantial
      indemnity scale</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his reasons, the trial judge awarded the client costs on the higher scale
    before he received submissions on the issue of costs.  On the record before
    us, there is no indication that submissions were made on the scale of costs.
    This is an error:  see <i>Consolidated Enfield Corp. v. Blair </i>(1996),
    28 O.R. (3d) 714 (Div. Ct.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge had awarded punitive damages, and the higher scale of costs did
    not follow as a matter of course. In Mark Orkin, <i>The Law of Costs</i>,
    looseleaf (Aurora: Canada Law Book, 2005) at s.&nbsp;219.1.2, the author
    says:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Some Canadian courts have declined to award both
    punitive damages and solicitor-and-client costs on the reasoning that a party
    who has been punished for misconduct by an award of punitive damages should
    not be further punished by having to pay costs on the higher scale.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    must be remembered that, as the trial judge noted, the client was a difficult
    person.  The solicitor was, in effect, the third solicitor representing the
    client on her case.  He had clearly stated to her in the past that he had
    little confidence in successfully prosecuting her claim. She had not paid
    his accounts and also appears to have broken promises of payment.  This was
    not a case of a solicitor and an inexperienced and vulnerable client.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    costs are discretionary, in this case the award of punitive damages rendered
    an award of substantial indemnity costs unnecessary, as costs on a substantial
    indemnity scale are additionally punitive. This client should not have been
    additionally rewarded with substantial indemnity costs.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    fixing the costs, the trial judge allowed fees of $28,360, $1985.20 for G.S.T.
    and $4561.78 in disbursements for a total of $34,906.98.  On a partial indemnity
    basis, I would reduce the fees by approximately 1/3 to $19,000 plus $1330
    for G.S.T. and $4561.78 for disbursements (inclusive of G.S.T.) for a total
    of $24,891.78. </p>

    a result, in light of my findings on the validity of the Minutes of Settlement,
    the amount owing to the solicitor of $24,348.43 is increased by $4242.19
    to $28,590.62.  The amount owing to the client ($2,000 + $5,000 + $24,891.78)
    is reduced to $31,891.78.  The net amount owing to the client is $3,311.16. </p>

    1, 2 and 5 of the judgment dated March 17, 2005 are varied in terms of these
    reasons.  In all other respects, the appeal is dismissed.</p>

    the end of oral argument, counsel were requested to make submissions on the
    costs of the appeal, assuming that costs would follow the event.  Counsel
    for the client submitted a bill of costs in the amount of approximately $18,800
    based on a substantial indemnity basis and $16,200 on a partial indemnity
    basis.  The solicitor submitted his bill of costs at approximately $72,000
    on a substantial indemnity basis and $62,300 on a partial indemnity basis.  The
    amounts claimed by the solicitor are unrealistic and bear no relationship
    to the nature of this appeal.</p>

    on the appeal is divided.  The client has been successful on the main issues
    relating to the conduct of the solicitor, while the solicitor has been successful
    as well, particularly on the scale of costs.  The degree of success still
    favours the client.  I would fix her costs of the appeal at $10,000.</p>
