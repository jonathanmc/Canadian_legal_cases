style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the night of January 11/12, 2003 there was a party at the Fox and Fiddle,
    a licensed bar and restaurant in Toronto.  The bar had been booked for a
    private function for approximately 90-100 people and two bands were to play.  The
    persons who attended the party were skinheads.  The police knew the party
    was to take place and set up surveillance outside because they feared a possible
    confrontation between the skinheads and an antiracism group.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    several hours of observation, two police detectives entered the Fox and Fiddle.  One
    detective observed the appellant behind a table putting away audio CDs.  When
    asked why he was packing up, he answered, “It doesn’t matter.  The CDs were
    selling slow tonight anyway.”  The CDs were laid flat, not stacked, and fully
    visible.  They were displayed beside sweatshirts bearing symbols that the
    detective understood to be associated with white supremacists.  The detective
    thought the CDs appeared to be of the kind that might afford evidence of
    wilful promotion of hatred or advocating genocide.  The police seized the
    CDs.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant indicated to the detective that he owned the CDs and that the cost
    of each CD was $20.  The detectives saw no sale or other distribution of
    the CDs.  Employees of the bar testified that different people were behind
    the tables during the course of the evening, that the appellant was behind
    the tables for a large part of the evening, and that some CDs had been sold.  No
    witness could testify that the appellant or anyone else had sold one of the
    fifteen specific CDs that were the subject of the charges.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    were eighty-four discs seized with sixty-seven different titles.  The charges
    against the appellant relate to fifteen of those CDs.  Folded inside most
    of the CD jackets were sheets on which the lyrics of the music were printed.  At
    trial, the appellant conceded that “some of the lyrics in each of the fifteen
    CDs promote hatred against the groups mentioned in the various counts corresponding
    to those fifteen CDs.” </p>

    trial judge, in his reasons for acquitting the appellant, stated that there
    was no evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that he was a skinhead or that
    he had sold any of the specific fifteen CDs.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    Superior Court judge found that the trial judge misdirected himself as to
    the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  He stated that not every
    fact of the Crown’s case needed to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and
    only the totality of the evidence must establish guilt beyond a reasonable
    doubt.  As an example, he pointed out that whether or not the appellant was
    a skinhead was a peripheral matter that did not need to be proved at all,
    let alone beyond a reasonable doubt.  The Superior Court judge also observed
    that the Crown did not have to prove that the offensive statement was communicated
    by a sale. </p>

    Superior Court judge then went on to find that there was sufficient evidence

    the accused.  </p>

    Superior Court judge was correct that the Crown did not have to prove that
    the appellant was a skinhead or that the statements were communicated by
    way of a sale.  It is understandable that the trial judge focused on whether
    the Crown had proved that the appellant had sold the CDs because there was
    no suggestion in the evidence that the CDs were distributed in any other
    way.</p>

    the accused.  He submits that the Crown led insufficient evidence at trial
    to establish the following elements of the offence:</p>

    appellant submitted that s. 319(2) did not apply as both the trial judge
    and the Superior Court judge found the gathering was a private party.  The
    issue, however, is not whether the statement is communicated in a setting
    that is private, but rather whether it is made “other than in private conversation.”  The
    evidence was that the bar had been rented for a private function and the
    general public was not admitted.  The affair, which might equally have been
    described as a concert, seems to have been promoted within the skinhead subculture.  There
    was no suggestion in the evidence of any personal selection of those who
    entered.  The evidence was that the premises had not been rented to the appellant
    and he had no control over who might enter.  </p>

    am satisfied that the Superior Court judge was correct in not regarding his
    finding that the setting was a private party as relevant to the analysis.</p>
  <h2 style='text-align:justify'>2. Wilfulness to Promote Hatred</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argued that the Crown had failed to prove that the appellant, assuming
    he had communicated statements, had done so with the wilful intention of
    promoting hatred.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;&quot;\[%2\:15\:0\:\]&quot; &quot;Russell Juriansz&quot; 20060906T1140'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the appellant argued that there was no evidence that the appellant was
    aware of the contents of the fifteen CDs among the many others that were
    seized and pointed out, for example, that there was no evidence that he had
    ever listened to them.  He argued that a person who distributes such CDs
    without adoption of the statements in the music is akin to a clerk at a bookstore
    who sells a hate promoting book or a librarian who allows someone to borrow
    a hate promoting book from a library.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, such analogies are not helpful as the mental element of an accused
    is a question of inference from all the evidence in an individual case.  This
    remains so even though s. 319(2) requires proof that the accused intended
    to produce the consequence of promoting hatred.  This court’s decision in <i>R.
    v. Buzzanga and Durocher</i> (1979), 49 C.C.C. (2d) 369 (Ont. C.A.), upon
    which the appellant strongly relied, makes this clear.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Buzzanga</i> a
    conviction under s. 319 was overturned because the Crown had not proved the
    requisite wilfulness to promote hatred.  The two accused had testified and
    explained that they had distributed pamphlets to expose the existence of
    prejudice against French Canadians and to create a furor that would compel
    the government to act. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    reversing the convictions in <i>Buzzanga,</i> the court held that it was
    not enough for the Crown to prove that the accused intended to distribute
    statements that promoted hatred.  The Crown had to prove that the accused
    did so with the intent of promoting hatred.  </p>

    J.A. reiterated the established principle at 387: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='

    consideration of all the circumstances, as well as from his own evidence,

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Martin
    J.A. went on to explain: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The purpose
    of this process, however, is to determine what the particular accused intended,
    not to fix him with the intention that a reasonable person might be assumed
    to have in the circumstances, where doubt exists as to the actual intention
    of the accused.  The accused’s testimony, if he gives evidence as to what
    was in his mind, is important material to be weighed with the other evidence
    in determining whether the necessary intent has been established.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case too, what the appellant intended or foresaw must be determined
    based on a consideration of all the circumstances as to what his state of
    mind or intention was.  I am satisfied that the evidentiary record, as it
    exists, is capable of supporting the inference that the appellant had the
    required intention to promote hatred.  That evidence included the fact that
    he was the owner of the CDs, he offered them for sale at a function where
    it was apparent entry was restricted principally to skinheads, he was behind
    the table for some 80% of the evening, he acknowledged that sales of the
    CDs had been slow, and the CDs were displayed on the tables laid out flat.  In
    making the inference the trier of fact could resort to the doctrine of documents
    in possession to fix the appellant with knowledge of the lyrics on the CDs,
    or find that the appellant was wilfully blind both as to the contents of
    the lyrics and as to the inevitable result that dissemination of the CDs
    would promote hatred. </p>

    the appellant had completed the act of communicating the statements in the

    his end to impart or transmit the statements promoting hatred contained on

    do not agree.  Communication requires the transmission of information from
    a sender to a receiver.  There is no evidence to support a finding that the
    appellant transmitted the statements in the music and on the lyric sheets
    to another person.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown’s alternative submission is that the graphic images and the song titles
    on the covers of the CDs themselves promote hatred and the appellant communicated
    these to others by displaying them to the persons in the room.  Indeed, the
    evidence was that the CDs were laid flat, not stacked, and spread across
    the two tables.  The function was well attended and, as mentioned, some people
    had approached the tables to buy CDs.  </p>

    appellant responded that the Crown could not rely upon the CD covers as the
    hate-promoting statements for the first time on appeal.  The appellant submitted
    that the Crown’s case against the appellant at trial was based upon the statements
    in the music on the CDs and the lyric sheets, not on the CD covers.  It would
    be unfair, the appellant said, to require him to respond to a different case
    than the one that the Crown brought at trial and lost.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the Crown did elicit some evidence about the CD covers and did refer to them
    in submissions, the prosecution was based on the statements in the music
    and on the lyric sheets.  The comments about the covers made by the Crown’s
    expert on hate crimes and hate group activity went to the issue of his knowledge
    of the content of the CDs.  </p>

    counsel’s references at trial to the display of the CDs were made while advancing
    the argument, rejected above, that the displaying and offering for sale of
    the CDs should be taken to constitute communication of the statements they
    contained.  For example, the Crown submitted to the trial judge:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The question
    is whether the act of putting those CDs out for display to the room, generally,
    is communicating the statements that are contained therein.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Most
    telling is that Crown counsel, at the outset of her submissions at trial,
    advised the judge that it was unnecessary for her to address whether the
    statements promoted hatred against the identifiable groups because that had
    been conceded by the defence.  The defence concession related only to the
    lyrics on the CDs.  As the Crown relied on the defence concession, it is
    evident the defence concession reflected the basis upon which the case was
    prosecuted.  The Crown did not ask the trial judge to make the finding that
    the CD covers promoted hatred.  The Crown is seeking a new trial to have
    this issue considered by a trial judge for the first time.</p>

    my view, it would offend the rule against double jeopardy to dismiss the
    appeal based on a new theory that the charges relate to the contents of the
    covers and not the CDs and lyric sheets. The comments of Doherty J.A. in <i>R.
    v. Varga</i> (1994), 90 C.C.C. (3d) 484, at 494 are apposite:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A Crown appeal
    cannot be the means whereby the Crown puts forward a different case than
    the one it chose to advance at trial. It offends double jeopardy principles,
    even as modified by the Crown’s right of appeal, to subject an accused, who
    has been acquitted, to a second trial based on arguments raised by the Crown
    for the first time on appeal. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Superior Court judge allowed the Crown’s appeal but mistakenly understood
    that the defence had conceded that the covers of the CDs promoted hatred.  In
    view of this error, his conclusion that there was sufficient evidence before
    the trial judge upon which the appellant could have been convicted cannot
    stand.  The appellant was prosecuted for communicating the statements in
    the music of the CDs and on the lyric sheets.  On the evidence before the
    trial judge, it could not be found beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant
    communicated such statements.</p>
