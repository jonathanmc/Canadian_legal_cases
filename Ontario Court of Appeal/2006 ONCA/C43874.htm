    Trade Medical Network Inc. seeks to set aside the judgment of Hoy J. dated
    June 24, 2005 dismissing its action for damages and for breach of confidence.  The
    appellant submits that the trial judge failed properly to apply the three
    part test enunciated by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Lac Minerals Ltd.
    v. International Corona Resources Ltd.</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 574.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Free
    Trade had an agreement with Community Care Network Inc. (“CCN”) entitling
    it to market CCN services.  It was not an exclusive agreement.  CCN is what
    is known in the medical insurance industry as a Preferred Provider Organization
    (“PPO”).  It provides access to discounted medical and hospital services
    throughout the United States.  These services are important to companies
    like the defendant RBC which is in the business of providing travel insurance
    to tourists and others travelling abroad.  RBC had had a contractual relationship
    with a predecessor of CCN through an intermediary but that contract had ended
    and RBC was seeking a new arrangement with a PPO on a direct contractual
    basis.  It was interested in continuing with CCN.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Hitchlock, the principal of the appellant, arranged the meeting on October
    31, 1997, with representatives of RBC, a representative of CCN and himself,
    in order to pitch CCN’s services.  Nothing was said at that meeting about
    the relationship between Free Trade and CCN.  In the course of the meeting,
    Mr. Hitchlock provided RBC with, amongst other things, a directory containing
    confidential information about CCN’s discounts.  This was important information
    and it enabled RBC to satisfy itself through a test analysis that CCN’s services
    met their needs.  On November 6, RBC entered into a contract directly with
    CCN.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the information in the directory was confidential
    and that it had been provided to RBC in confidence.  She concluded, however,
    that Free Trade was not entitled to claim breach of confidence because it
    was not the “owner” of the confidential information.  Rather, CCN was.  She
    also found that there had been no misuse of the information.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    November 6 agreement did not involve Free Trade and was made at a meeting
    to which Mr. Hitchlock was not invited, even though he had had some further
    involvement in the test process.  In short, Free Trade was cut out of the
    deal.  It failed to obtain redress in an arbitration proceeding against CNN
    in United States and subsequently, brought this action against RBC.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    we understand the appellant’s argument, the complaint is that Free Trade
    provided the confidential information in the directory to RBC and RBC either
    used it to improperly enter into a deal directly with CCN or used it improperly
    by disclosing it to their agent Mr. Hodosy whom RBC had retained to help
    it find a direct deal with a PPO.  There is no suggestion that Mr. Hodosy
    or RBC used the information for anything other than analysing the discounts
    in the test scenario, which resulted in the RBC/CCN agreement, or that they
    disclosed the information to anyone other than persons in the RBC/CCN/Free
    Trade orbit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, however, Free Trade obviously feels that it was deprived of a
    potentially lucrative commercial arrangement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    three elements that must be established to make out a claim for breach of
    confidence, as established in <i>Lac Minerals</i> are the following:</p>
  <p>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    information conveyed must be confidential;</p>
  <p>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    information must have been communicated in confidence, and, </p>
  <p>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    information must have been misused by the party to whom it was communicated
    to the detriment of the party who confided it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    behalf of the appellant, Mr. McDonald argues that the trial judge made a
    fundamental error in applying the foregoing test by failing to consider the
    third element and, more particularly, by concluding that a party asserting
    breach of confidence is not entitled to rely upon a misuse of confidential
    information unless it is the “owner” of that information.  He submits that
    this error skewed the entirety of the trial judge’s reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not agree.  Subject to the following comment, she applied the test correctly
    and, in the result, there is no reversible error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge relied upon the decision of Lord Denning M. R. in <i>Fraser v.
    Evans</i>, [1968] Q.B. 349 and the decision of Nordheimer J. in <i>Air Canada
    v. Westjet Airlines Ltd</i>., [2004] O.J. No. 5627 (S.C.J.).  We accept that
    it may not be accurate in all cases of breach of confidence to say that the
    person seeking to rely upon a confidence must be the owner of the confidential
    information.  As Lord Denning said in <i>Fraser v. Evans</i>, however, </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>… the party
    complaining must be the person who is entitled to the confidence and to have
    it respected.  He must be a person to whom the duty of good faith is owed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Free
    Trade does not fall into that category.  RBC had no relationship with Free
    Trade other than in its capacity as a representative of CCN.  The confidential
    information in the directory was CCN’s confidential information (this was
    acknowledged in a non-exclusive agreement between Free Trade and CCN).  The
    information was being provided by, or on behalf of CCN, to assist RBC in
    deciding whether to contract with CCN as its PPO.  We can see nothing on
    the record that would support an argument that Free Trade is the person who
    is entitled to the confidence and to have it respected (except insofar as
    necessary to protect CCN) or that RBC owed a duty of good faith to Free Trade
    in a fashion sought to be established by the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, there was no misuse of the confidential information in our opinion.  In
    this regard, the trial judge did not fail to apply the third element of the <i>Lac
    Minerals</i> test.  She made a finding that the confidential information
    had not been misused.  We agree.  The discounted information in the directory
    was used for exactly the purpose intended, namely, to facilitate the negotiation
    of a contract with CCN.  Any disclosure to Mr. Hodosy was justified because
    he was RBC’s agent and was entitled to deal with CCN on RBC’s behalf.  Neither
    he nor RBC used the information for any other purpose.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs
    to the respondent fixed at $25,017.99 inclusive of disbursements and GST.  The
    $135,000 (and any accruing interest) posted as security for costs by the
    appellant is to be released to the credit of the respondent.</p>
