      respondent, Christian Herbert Harold Magee, be transferred from a maximum
      security mental health facility in Penetanguishene to a medium secure facility
      in Toronto.  At issue is: (i) whether the Review Board erred in law when

      under s.&nbsp;672.54 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46;

      October 21, 1977, Mr. Magee was found not guilty by reason of insanity

      under the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 542-547, concerning
      mentally ill offenders.  On January 5, 1980, he was found not guilty by
      reason of insanity on two additional charges of first degree murder, one
      charge of rape and one charge of indecent assault.  </span></p>

      1977 until 1992, Mr. Magee was held in custody at the Mental Health Centre

      persons found “not criminally responsible” (“NCR”) on account of mental
      disorder,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a> Mr. Magee came under

      Magee, who is now 58 years of age, has been detained in custody at Oak
      Ridge for almost 29 years.  </span></p>

      hearing, Mr. Magee renewed his request for a transfer to a suitable medium
      secure facility in Ontario.  He did not seek access to the community.</span></p>

      the person in charge of CAMH, Mr. Magee may attend within or outside of
      CAMH for necessary medical, dental, legal or compassionate purposes, on
      notice to the local police of his entry into the community.  Although not

      June 15, 1976, Mr. Magee enticed a 15-year-old girl to accept a ride in
      his truck.  He then strangled her, stabbed her in the throat and chest
      area, cut her across the abdomen above her vagina, and raped her.  Until
      his appeal from his conviction for first degree murder was dismissed in
      1979, Mr. Magee denied any involvement in these crimes.  At that time,
      he informed the authorities of his commission of additional offences, namely,
      two further murders, a rape and a sexual assault perpetrated during the
      period between March 1974 to November 1975.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      first of these additional offences involved the murder of a 19-year-old
      girl, who Mr. Magee grabbed on March 2, 1974 when she was on her way home
      after shopping at a variety store and purchasing a pizza.  Mr. Magee appears
      to have made sexual demands and, when the victim refused and struggled,
      he slashed her throat with a knife (nearly severing her head from her body),
      and then sexually assaulted and robbed her. </span></p>

      next offence took place on June 20, 1975.  The female victim was returning
      home from a local library when Mr. Magee came up behind her, grabbed her
      around her throat, and ordered her to remove her clothes.  When she refused,
      he tightened his grip around her throat, strangling her until she passed
      out.  After she recovered consciousness, it was discovered that her vagina
      had been injured and it appeared that she had been sexually assaulted.  </span></p>

      third offence, another murder, occurred on October 20, 1975.  On this occasion,
      Mr. Magee strangled a 19-year-old female acquaintance and knifed her in
      the throat.  Although the victim’s underwear was removed, no signs of a
      sexual attack were later detected.  Mr. Magee acknowledged that he went
      to the victim’s home and, on gaining entry, grabbed her and forced her
      to the floor for the purpose of having sex.  He claimed that he did not
      carry through with this act, but admitted that he had no control over what
      he was doing and that he strangled the victim, first with his hands and
      then with a shoelace, which he tied around her throat.  He then stabbed
      her in the throat with a knife.</span></p>

      last index offence took place on November 3, 1975.  It involved the rape
      of a 14-year-old female hitchhiker who accepted a ride from Mr. Magee.  Mr.
      Magee struck the victim in the face, tore her clothes off, had forced intercourse
      with her causing lacerations to her vagina, strangled her until she lost
      consciousness, and hit her on the head with a pop bottle.  She was later
      found naked and semi-conscious on the road.  She sustained a fractured

      his 1992 report, Dr. Bradford described Mr. Magee as “a serial murderer” who “presents
      with a problem of very serious sexual violence directed towards young adult
      and adolescent females”.  Mr. Magee admitted to Dr. Bradford that he engaged
      in coercive sexual and rape fantasies involving adults, fantasies with
      elements of rape and “lust murder” followed by cannibalism, and fantasies
      of sex with his sister and his daughter.  In addition, on testing, Mr.
      Magee showed “a significant level of sexual arousal to a highly sadistic

      the 2005 Risk Assessment also indicated that Mr. Magee had expressed a
      keen interest in “resuming a heterosexual relationship” once discharged

      he could “progress”, or be happy and
    “grow”, was to move to a medium secure facility in order to become involved
    in a heterosexual relationship.  In addition, in her testimony before the
    Review Board, Dr. Ramshaw confirmed that Mr. Magee’s motivation in seeking
    a transfer to a medium secure hospital is to obtain access to women and to
    his family, including his daughter (about whom he admits to having sex-related

      victims’ love, or as the result of his former wife’s alleged abuse of him.  He
      has stated that he is “a person that needs a lot of love and affection”.  According
      to Dr. Ramshaw, Mr. Magee attributes his past offending </span>behaviours<span lang=EN-US> (in

      these concerns, MHCP clinical team members who prepared the 2005 Risk Assessment
      expressed the unanimous opinion that the likelihood of Mr. Magee reoffending
      in the future continues to be “extremely high” and that he remains a significant
      risk to the safety of the public.  Their opinions and recommendations were
      summarized as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he Clinical Team believes that Mr. Magee’s risk
    factors underscore his continued requirement for a highly structured and
    supervised hospital setting in order to ensure the safety of the public,
    including hospital staff and co-patients.  Further, it is their opinion that
    a co-educational setting, with a greater percentage of female staff and patients,
    would potentially place others at undue risk given the nature of the index
    offences and other previous sexual behaviour, as well as Mr. Magee’s ongoing
    desire to once again become involved in a heterosexual relationship. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   In summary, it is the unanimous recommendation
    of the Clinical Team that Mr. Magee must continue to be detained at the Oak
    Ridge facility.  It is their opinion that the Oak Ridge facility would continue
    to provide the least onerous and restrictive setting at this time.  Clearly,
    this facility is uniquely resourced and structured to be able to address
    the twin-goals of safety/security of the public as well as quality of life
    issues for patients such as Mr. Magee, who would otherwise require extremely
    restrictive conditions to be able to reside within a less secure environment

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mr. Magee still harbors deviant sexual fantasies

    Magee’s risk to the community cannot be overstated.  He scores high on all

    suggests that Mr. Magee is unlikely to be responsive to treatment, and equally
    as important, is a strong indicator of a high risk of re-offending.
    … The evidence before the Board clearly shows that Mr. Magee desires a new
    relationship and given Mr. Magee’s history and predilection for sadist sexual
    violence towards women, it is an unacceptable risk to have Mr. Magee in contact

      the Board completed its risk assessment of Mr. Magee and concluded that
      his risk could be contained – in a security sense – in a medium secure
      hospital environment, it was incumbent upon the Board to then evaluate

      (including programs for sexual offenders), save for emergency or compassionate

      activities of the type currently afforded to him at MHCP has diminished.  If,

      that Mr. Magee, knowing “the challenges that face him on the medium secure
      unit at CAMH”, had nonetheless requested a transfer.  With respect, this
      misses the point.  The application of the s.&nbsp;672.54 requirements cannot
      be avoided, or satisfied, by the fact that an NCR accused wishes to be
      transferred, knowing that the consequences of the requested transfer may
      cause him difficulties.  </span></p>

      of many factors to be considered by the Review Board, it was not dispositive
      of whether his transfer to CAMH would meet his mental health and other
      needs, and ensure the safety of the public.  Indeed, given the evidence
      that Mr. Magee persists in seeking a transfer to a medium secure facility
      because he believes that it will facilitate his desired access to women,

        curiae </i>counsel asserted in his factum filed with this court that
        Mr. Magee’s continued detention at Oak Ridge would infringe Mr. Magee’s
        rights under s.&nbsp;7 of the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>,
        this claim was not pursued in oral argument before us.  Nor was it raised
        before the Review Board.  In any event, the <i>Charter </i>challenge,
        as I understand it, is premised on the proposition that the denial of
        Mr. Magee’s transfer to a medium secure unit at CAMH would unjustifiably
        interfere with his personal liberty.  However, as I have </span>endeavoured <span lang=EN-US>to
        explain, there was evidence before the Review Board, which the Board
        failed to consider, suggesting that it is the transfer to CAMH, rather
        than the continuation of his detention at MHCP, that would trigger further
        restrictions upon Mr. Magee’s liberty interests.  It is for the Review
        Board conducting the rehearing to determine, on all the relevant evidence
        before it, which disposition for Mr. Magee will satisfy the requirements
        of s.&nbsp;672.54.</span></p>

      the reasons given, I would allow the appeal, set aside the Review Board’s
      disposition order and refer the matter back to the Board for a rehearing.  As
      Mr. Magee’s circumstances may have changed since the date of the disposition
      order at issue on this appeal, I would further direct that the rehearing
      be expedited and that, pending the rehearing, Mr. Magee continue to be
      detained at the Oak Ridge Division of MHCP.</span></p>
