    the appellant to pay the respondent child and spousal support monthly.  The
    appellant seeks to have the order set aside and requests the following: </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'>(1)       A Final Order for sole custody of the children in favour of the appellant; </p>

    directions to the trial judge.  The appellant further requests that this
    court order a stay of the judgment pending the disposition of the appeal.  The
    appellant also seeks costs of the appeal and throughout.  The respondent
    requests a dismissal of the appeal and costs of the appeal.  Alternatively,
    the respondent requests a new trial.   </p>

    appellant and the respondent met in Japan in 1994.  The couple married in
    Canada on October 27, 1997.  They have two children.  They separated on February&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2003.  The
    appellant brought an application before the trial judge seeking sole custody,

    for activities in which the children are enrolled.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant and respondent retained Dr. Weinberger to prepare a custody and
    access assessment for the purposes of the application hearing.  On July 7,
    2004, he reported that he could not see how a joint decision making arrangement
    would be feasible in the circumstances.  He did, however, note that this
    might change if the respondent became healthy and settled into recovery.  Dr.
    Weinberger recommended interim sole custody to the appellant, to be reviewed
    in 18-24 months, with significant ongoing but defined access that included
    weekends, overnights and extensive holiday time to the respondent. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the application hearing, Dr. Sweet testified that the respondent suffers
    from substance abuse and Type II bi-polar affective disorder.  He also stated
    that he is not especially disturbed by the respondent’s relapses because
    he believes psychiatric assistance will help the respondent.  He identified
    prospective treatment of the respondent with antibuse.  The respondent has
    been unable to pay for such medication but Dr. Sweet testified that the medication
    would be made available to the respondent, possibly without charge, if ordered
    by the court.  He testified that he would be prepared to prescribe its use
    and to supervise the treatment.  The respondent not only consented to such
    an order, but also expressed a wish that it be made.  Dr. Sweet believed
    that the respondent was gradually learning about and accepting her problems.  He
    stated, however, that to improve, the respondent would have to absent herself
    from work for two years.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on his findings of fact and a review of the applicable legal principles,
    the trial judge made numerous orders, including joint custody of the children,
    antibuse treatment for the respondent, and monthly payments of $225 and $325
    for child and spousal support, respectively, to the respondent.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>1.         Did the trial judge
      err in making his custody order?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s submission on this point may be summarized as follows.  The trial
    judge erred by making his custody order on the basis of what would purportedly
    be in the best interests of the <i>respondent</i>, instead of the <i>children</i>.  The
    trial judge found that co-parenting would help the respondent with her substance
    abuse recovery efforts.  He also based his decision on his finding that if
    he granted the appellant sole custody, the respondent’s potential future
    enlarged parenting role would be prejudiced by such an order, and that if
    she had to wait one-and-a-half to two years for such a parenting role, this
    would be a disincentive to her efforts to overcome her drug and alcohol addictions.  The
    trial judge was obliged to consider each of the factors in the <i>Childrens’ Law
    Reform Act</i> in light of the evidence adduced at trial.  The trial judge
    failed to do so.  In addition, he misdirected himself with respect to the
    relevant evidence in favour of sole custody and with respect to the relevant
    evidence against joint and shared custody. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree.  In our opinion, the trial judge did not base his decision on the
    best interests of the respondent.  The trial judge recognized that the legal
    test was the best interests of the children and specifically dealt with all
    of the factors relating to that test. The trial judge did comment that joint
    custody would be contingent on the respondent’s continuing efforts to stay
    clear of substance abuse.  He also opined that joint custody would serve
    as an incentive to her and that a delay in commencing joint custody could
    be a disincentive.  A parent’s sobriety and addiction issues are clearly
    significant in determining the best interests of children and the trial judge
    did not commit an error in making the comments he did.  The trial judge saw
    the respondent’s sobriety as a factor in determining her fitness to parent
    and not as an end in and of itself, or the objective of his ultimate parenting
    decision.  The factual findings made by the trial judge served as a backdrop
    to his analysis of what was in the best interests of the children.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to shared custody, the appellant submits that all of the evidence
    disclosed that the parents were unable to co-operate and therefore to co-parent.  We
    do not agree that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence.  His decision
    is entitled to deference.  The trial judge noted that the parents agreed
    to engage and jointly pay for Dr.&nbsp;Weinberger’s assessment.  He adopted
    Dr. Weinberger’s comment to the effect that, “the girls love their mother
    and it would be hurtful to them to have any loss of time or contact with
    her.”  He held, however, that Dr. Weinberger’s opinion that joint decision
    making was not feasible did not accord with the actual regime that was in
    place. They were able to agree to access schedules including holiday access;
    while there were difficulties coordinating pickup and drop-off times they
    were able to do so.  They agreed that the children would attend bible school
    and other extra curricular activities.  We would defer to the trial judge’s
    finding that, despite their difficulties, the parents were the able to co-parent
    and that that arrangement was in the best interests of the children.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>2.         Did the trial judge
      err in allowing Dr. Sweet to give expert evidence?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in permitting Dr. Sweet to give
    evidence, or in the alternative, that he gave evidence outside of his area
    of expertise.  Dr.&nbsp;Sweet testified as to the respondent’s efforts and
    ability to rehabilitate herself.  He also gave evidence as to the respondent’s
    ability to parent her children.  Dr. Sweet is not a psychiatrist or a psychologist
    and has no background in child psychology .The appellant submits that Dr.
    Sweet could not give an opinion with respect to the respondent’s ability
    to parent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge specifically considered the four-part test articulated in <i>Mohan </i>in
    determining whether to allow the Dr.&nbsp;Sweet’s expert evidence.  Dr. Sweet
    was able to show “special or peculiar knowledge through study or experience” in
    the areas of addictions and related psychological problems.  He was previously
    recognized as an expert in a similar case before the Ontario Superior Court.  Dr.
    Sweet had extensive experience in dealing with addiction and the psychological
    effects of addiction and the respondent had been his patient for a long time.  It
    was open to the trial judge to qualify Dr. Sweet as an expert and to admit
    his evidence.  Nor did the trial judge misuse that evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    only issue with respect to the respondent’s parenting ability was her substance
    abuse and mental health problems.  Dr. Sweet was entitled to testify with
    respect to those issues.  The trial judge used that evidence to conclude
    that she could parent and it was open to him to do that. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the appellant also complains that he was not given an expert’s report ahead
    of time, the trial judge provided the appellant’s counsel with the opportunity
    of an adjournment, which was refused.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would dismiss this ground of appeal</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>3.         Did the trial judge
      err in making the spousal support award?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge failed to consider any of the factors
    delineated in the <i>Family Law Act</i> regarding entitlement or quantum
    of spousal support.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our opinion a fair reading of the trial judge’s reasons as a whole indicates
    that he did turn his mind to the factors outlined in the <i>Family Law Act.  </i>In
    particular, he considered the appellant’s and the respondent’s current and
    future assets and means, their capacities to contribute to their own support,
    their needs, and the nature of their relationship.  We see no reason to interfere.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
