    is an appeal by Enernorth Industries Inc. (Enernorth) from a judgment granting
    an application brought by Oakwell Engineering Limited (Oakwell) for an order
    recognizing and enforcing in Ontario a judgment granted against Enernorth
    by the High Court of the Republic of Singapore on October 16, 2003 and affirmed
    by the Court of Appeal of the Republic of Singapore on April 27, 2004. The
    judgment under appeal also dismissed an application brought by Enernorth
    for a declaration that the Singapore judgment cannot be recognized or enforced
    in Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s position is that the Singapore judgment was granted by a corrupt
    legal system, with biased judges, in a jurisdiction that operates outside
    the rule of law and, as such, ought not be enforced in Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent’s position was accurately summarized in the application judge’s
    reasons as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>While Oakwell
    acknowledges that Enernorth has tendered some evidence relating to possible
    government interference in trials, all of that evidence applies only to political
    cases. The case at bar is a commercial case. There is no evidence that Singapore
    courts are biased when deciding a commercial case between private parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Singapore proceedings arose out of Oakwell’s successful tender in 1995 for
    a contract to build and operate power generation facilities in India. Because
    Oakwell lacked the financial resources to complete the project on its own,
    in 1997 it entered into a joint venture agreement with Enernorth. Under their
    agreement, together, they formed the “Project Company”
    to finance, construct and operate the project.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Disputes
    arose between the two, which were eventually resolved in a December, 1998
    Settlement Agreement. In addition to stating the parties’
    rights and obligations going forward, the Settlement Agreement provided that
    any disputes were to be governed by Singapore law and subject to the non-exclusive
    jurisdiction of the Singapore courts. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under
    that Settlement Agreement, Oakwell sold to Enernorth its interest in the
    Project Company and any claims it may have had under previous agreements
    between the parties. In return, Enernorth agreed to give Oakwell: (1) 1.85
    million Enernorth shares; (2) U.S. $2.79 million upon successful financing
    of the Project (“Financial Closure”); and (3) a royalty equal to 6.25% of
    the available cash flow from the first five years of the Project’s commercial
    operation. Both parties agreed to do all things necessary to give effect
    to the Settlement Agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ultimately,
    Enernorth did not achieve Financial Closure and, in August 2000, without
    informing Oakwell, Enernorth divested its interest in Project Company to
    a third party without in any way dealing with its second and third obligations,
    as set out above, to Oakwell. Oakwell took the position that Enernorth, in
    not providing for the disputed sums, had repudiated its obligations to Oakwell
    under the Settlement Agreement. Enernorth took the position that when it
    did not achieve Financial Closure, it was absolved of any obligation to pay
    Oakwell the disputed sums.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    Oakwell learned of the repudiation, it sued Enernorth in Singapore in accordance
    with the attornment and choice of law clauses in the Settlement Agreement.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties’ positions are best articulated in their respective factums as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><b><u>The Appellant</u></b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;'>Before its
    assets are seized under Canadian law to pay Oakwell’s claims, Enernorth is
    seeking to have its defence to those claims adjudicated in a legal system
    that guarantees a trial before an independent and impartial judiciary and
    in a jurisdiction that operates under the rule of law. This will be had in
    Canada. What Enernorth is faced with, however, is having its assets seized
    under Canadian law to pay a judgment that was granted by a corrupt legal
    system before biased judges in a jurisdiction that operates outside the rule
    of law. Canadian law mandates the former. Justice Day imposed the latter. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;'>This case concerns
    a judgment from the courts of Singapore. The uncontradicted evidence in this
    case, from leading international experts, reveals that Singapore is ruled
    by a small oligarchy who control all facets of the Singapore state including
    the judiciary, which is utterly politicised. The judiciary bends over backwards
    to support the government’s and ruling elite’s interests. Oakwell has close
    ties to the government. The trial judge held that Enernorth had breached
    a contract with Oakwell when Enernorth had done no such thing, and the Court
    of Appeal upheld the judgment, after a perfunctory hearing, despite the existence
    of manifest legal errors under Singapore law.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice
    Day correctly rejected Enernorth’s attack on the Singapore legal system.
    In doing so, he carefully followed the test for enforcement of foreign judgments
    prescribed by the Supreme Court of Canada’s recent decision in <i>Beals v.
    Saldanha</i>. First, he concluded that the Singapore courts had jurisdiction
    over the dispute. Enernorth has not contested this point. Second, Justice
    Day examined the various defences to enforcement advanced by Enernorth. He
    considered, and rejected, each defence that Enernorth now advances on appeal.
    He concluded that the Singapore courts are characterized by the rule of law
    and judicial independence; that Singapore’s judiciary enjoys a demonstrated
    reputation for fairness in commercial matters; that the Singapore proceedings
    were conducted fairly in keeping with the principles of natural justice;
    that there was no evidence of a reasonable apprehension of bias against Enernorth,
    let alone actual bias, and that Enernorth’s most important witnesses had
    contradicted themselves and their opinions could not be accepted [citation
    omitted].</p>
  <h2 style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'><u><span style='font-size:

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge relied on the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <i>Beals
    v. Saldanha</i>, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 416, and concluded: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[T]he test to
    decide recognition and enforcement of the Singapore decision will be whether
    or not the foreign court properly assumed jurisdiction by applying the real
    and substantial connection test. If that test is met, the court will then
    decide whether or not Enernorth succeeds in proving any of its defences. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>He had no difficulty concluding that there was a real and substantial connection
    with Singapore, and his finding in this respect is not disputed in this court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rather,
    the appellant argues that there are three pre-conditions, or “filters”, for
    recognizing a foreign judgment and enforcing that judgment domestically.
    Those three factors are:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>1. That the foreign court must have appropriately exercised jurisdiction based
    on the “real and substantial connection” test (first filter);</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>2. That the legal system of the court from which the judgment came must meet
    Canadian constitutional standards (second filter); and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>3. That the foreign proceedings must not have been tainted by fraud or conflict
    with the law or public policy of Canada (third filter).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant relies on certain passages from the majority judgment in <i>Beals</i> to
    support its “second filter” argument. The passages cited are all found in
    that part of the majority judgment where the defence of natural justice is
    discussed. They are not isolated stand-alone passages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the majority judgment in <i>Beals</i> makes it clear that once an
    enforcing court is satisfied pursuant to the “real and substantial connection” test
    set out in <i>Morguard Investments Ltd. v. De Savoye</i>, [1990] 3 S.C.R.
    1077, that the foreign court properly took jurisdiction, it next must consider
    the defences available to a domestic defendant, who seeks to have a Canadian
    court refuse enforcement of a foreign judgment. As Major J., for the majority,
    noted at paragraph 40 of  <i>Beals</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The defences
    of fraud, public policy and lack of natural justice were developed before <i>Morguard,
    supra</i>, and still pertain.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    majority then went on to consider these three defences and concluded, at
    paragraph 79:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Having properly
    taken jurisdiction, the judgment of that court must be recognized and enforced
    by a domestic court, provided that no defences bar its enforcement. None
    of the existing defences of fraud, natural justice or public policy have
    been supported by the evidence. Although the damage award may appear disproportionate
    to the original value of the land in question, that cannot be determinative.
    The judgment of the Florida court should be enforced.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the only support that might be found in <i>Beals</i> for the appellant’s “second
    filter” argument lies in the dissenting judgment of LeBel J. This court is
    bound by the majority opinion, which holds that, absent special or unusual
    circumstances which may require the creation of a new defence, the court’s
    inquiry is limited to a consideration of three defences –
    fraud, public policy and natural justice – once jurisdiction is established. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    to the “third filter” that the foreign proceedings must not have been tainted
    by fraud or conflict with the law or public policy of Canada
    – the Supreme Court of Canada has defined this concept as a defence. It is
    not, as the appellant asserts, a precondition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge carefully considered the evidence as it related to the
    defences of public policy, bias (as an aspect of the public policy defence)
    and natural justice. The defence of fraud was not raised.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    will now turn to his consideration of each of those defences and assess his
    conclusion that they have not been made out.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Beals</i>,
    Major J. described the scope of the public policy defence at paragraphs 71
    and 75:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The third and
    final defence is that of public policy. This defence prevents the enforcement
    of a foreign judgment which is contrary to the Canadian concept of justice.
    The public policy defence turns on whether the foreign <u>law</u> is contrary
    to our view of basic morality. As stated in Castel and Walker, <i>supra</i>,
    at p. 14-28:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>…. the traditional
    public policy defence appears to be directed at the concept of repugnant
    laws and not repugnant facts…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>How is this
    defence of assistance to a defendant seeking to block the enforcement of
    a foreign judgment?  It would, for example, prohibit the enforcement of a  foreign
    judgment that is founded on a law contrary to the fundamental morality of
    the Canadian legal system. Similarly, the public policy defence guards against
    the enforcement of a judgment rendered by a foreign court proven to be corrupt
    or biased.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The use of the
    defence of public policy to challenge the enforcement of a foreign judgment
    involves impeachment of that judgment by condemning the foreign law on which
    the judgment is based. It is not a remedy to be used lightly. The expansion
    of this defence to include perceived injustices that do not offend our sense
    of morality is unwarranted. The defence of public policy should continue
    to have narrow application [emphasis in original].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge concluded that “in the present case the asserted repugnancy
    is in the facts emanating out of Singapore, not the laws of Singapore” and,
    accordingly, he concluded that the defence of public policy is not available. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Enernorth’s
    attack on the judgment in question is not that it resulted from a law that
    is contrary to the fundamental morality of the Canadian legal system, but
    rather that it is the product of a corrupt legal system, with biased judges,
    in a jurisdiction that operates outside the rule of law.</p>

    in support of its bias argument. He considered the exchange between a witness
    and the Singapore trial judge concerning the correct spelling of the Koh
    Brothers Group’s name, and the fact they now controlled Oakwell. He concluded
    that this evidence was insufficient to prove bias or corruption. He considered
    the evidence of the expert witnesses – Ross Worthington, Nihal Jayawickrama
    and Francis T. Seow – and concluded that their evidence was either unreliable
    (as in the case of Mr. Worthington) or too general to prove that there was
    not a fair trial in this case. He concluded there was a lack of evidence
    of corruption or bias in private commercial cases and no cogent evidence
    of bias in this specific case.<i></i></p>

    trial in Singapore, Enernorth did not contest the jurisdiction of the Singapore
    court, nor did it allege bias against the presiding judiciary. Enernorth
    argued that it would have been impossible for it to raise in the Singapore
    action, the defences it raises here. It has suggested that in doing so, it
    would likely face charges of sedition there. I note, however, that Enernorth
    in the Settlement Agreement agreed that the agreement was to be governed
    by Singapore law and that the courts of Singapore were to have non-exclusive
    jurisdiction to hear disputes over the agreement. It advanced a U.S. $175
    million counterclaim against Oakwell. The trial lasted thirteen days. As
    is the practice in Singapore, evidence-in-chief was led by way of affidavits
    from the twenty-one witnesses. Both parties had full opportunity to cross-examine
    each other’s witnesses and filed extensive written submissions of fact and
    law. Judgment was reserved for several months and, thereafter, the trial
    judge issued a forty-six page judgment. Enernorth was ordered to pay to Oakwell
    the disputed sums in full. Enernorth’s counterclaim was dismissed.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Enernorth
    then appealed the judgment to the Singapore Court of Appeal, solely on the
    merits of the decision. It did not challenge the conduct or fairness of the
    trial, the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts or the impartiality of the
    judiciary. The appeal was dismissed from the bench.</p>

    the time of the Settlement Agreement, Enernorth was at all times represented

    ruling political party.</p>

    application judge considered both the substantive and procedural law of Singapore,
    as well as its constitution and compared those laws to the Canadian rule
    of law. He concluded that “while Enernorth’s experts, political scientists
    and lawyers, provide reports that aspects of the government of Singapore
    do not meet the standards of the rule of law in Canada, this evidence goes
    against Singapore’s formal legal structure as evidenced by its constitution
    and laws” and, importantly, “furthermore, Oakwell has provided evidence to
    the contrary”. He concluded that, on a balance of probabilities, both parties
    enjoyed fair process in the Singapore courts.</p>
