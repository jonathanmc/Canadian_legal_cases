  <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is an appeal by Metropolitan Toronto Condominium Corporation No. 545 (the
    Corporation) from the dismissal of its application for an order permitting
    it to enter the respondents’ dwelling units to carry out certain repairs
    or maintenance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Corporation maintains that the manner in which the respondents carried out
    remediation work on the fan coil units (FCUs) located in their condominium
    units left their units in a condition that was “likely to damage the property<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a> or cause injury to an
    individual.”<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a>  As
    a result, the Corporation argues that it was entitled to the order sought
    pursuant to ss.&nbsp;19, 117, 119 and 134 of the <i>Condominium Act, 1998</i>,
    S.O. 1998, c. 19 (the <i>Condominium Act</i>)<i>.</i>  The Corporation further
    argues that the application judge made palpable and overriding errors of
    fact in reaching her decision to dismiss the application.  Finally, it submits
    that, by failing to afford the appropriate degree of deference to decisions
    of the Corporation, the application judge committed a reversible error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.  The application judge
    made no palpable and overriding error of fact nor did she fail to afford
    the Corporation’s decision the appropriate degree of deference.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>SUMMARY OF THE RELEVANT FACTS</h3>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'><u>The parties </u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Corporation manages a 231 unit condominium at 55 Skymark Drive in Toronto.  The
    respondents are unit holders in this condominium.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'><u>The dispute</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    May 2004, the Corporation commissioned an investigation of possible mould
    contamination in the heating and air conditioning FCUs located in the various
    condominium units of the building.  The report provided to the Corporation
    by George White, a mycologist, confirmed that there was mould contamination
    in the FCUs.  Substantial mould contamination was found in ten of the thirteen
    FCUs that he examined.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    report stated that it is difficult to actually assess the risk related to
    mould exposure, but that it could safely be assumed that there is an increased
    risk associated with any increase in exposure.  The risk identified was an “occupant
    risk”.  Although the report did not suggest that mould from the FCUs in one
    residential unit would disperse to another unit, the report noted that there
    would be risks to the property value and reputation if the issues were not
    handled in a sensible and timely manner.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>White
    opined that it was more prudent to eliminate the risk factor than to determine
    what the acceptable level of risk actually was.  He cautioned that this approach,
    however, was not always cost-effective and ran the risk of overreacting in
    some settings.  He then suggested that, in response to mould contamination,
    three different remedial options were available.  The first, and most expensive,
    involved removing the contaminated insulation, replacing it with a different
    insulation and modifying the FCUs to minimize the recurrence of mould contamination.  The
    second involved removing most of the contamination by HEPA vacuums and disinfectants.  The
    third was a combination of the first and second options.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    June 28, 2004, the Corporation held a special meeting of residents.  White
    was present at this meeting and the issue of mould contamination was discussed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    previously determined that the repair and maintenance of FCUs was a unit
    holder responsibility, the Corporation advised the residents, by August 26,
    2004 letter, of their responsibility and gave residents a list of contractors
    who carry out this type of repair.  The letter indicated that this list was
    neither a referral nor a recommendation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Corporation then retained Construction Control Inc., consulting engineers
    and building scientists, to research and investigate the problem and to prepare
    specifications for mould remediation.  In September 28, 2004, another meeting
    of unit holders was held.  The President of the Corporation advised those
    in attendance that the unit holders were free to make their own arrangements
    for mould remediation.  However, he indicated that they would have to comply
    with the protocol for remediation set by the Corporation’s engineers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    October 2004, the Corporation reiterated that the remediation was the responsibility
    of the unit holders and advised that the Corporation had approved Dry Coil
    Limited (Dry Coil) as the authorized contractor after the usual tendering
    process.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each
    of the respondents chose not to use the pre-approved contractor and made
    this intention known to the Corporation.  In response, the Corporation wrote
    to the respondents, requiring that they comply with a list of conditions
    at their own expense.  These conditions included pre and post remediation
    air quality tests and that the remediation be done in accordance with the
    New York Protocol, Level 5.  The letter also advised that a note would be
    placed in the file for each of the units, indicating that periodic inspections
    of the FCUs were required.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents formally advised the Corporation that they did not consider that
    they were required to comply with these conditions.  Despite the Corporation’s
    continuing insistence that its listed conditions be complied with, the respondents
    ignored them and proceeded to have the remediation carried out by their own
    contractor, Reliable Fan Coil Maintenance (Reliable).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reliable
    was one of the contractors mentioned in the August 26, 2004 list of contractors
    provided by the Corporation.  The remediation by Reliable was done at a cost
    of about $100 per FCU, as compared to approximately $1500 per FCU if done
    by the Corporation’s contractor.  The remediation done by Reliable was completed
    to the New York Protocol, Level 1 standard.  In Reliable’s view, the Level
    1 standard was sufficient.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents did not provide the Corporation with reports following the remediation.  They
    did, however, advise the Corporation that it could, at its expense, have
    its engineer and contractor inspect the work done by Reliable.  The Corporation
    maintained its position that a Level 5 remediation was required.  Since the
    respondents had readily admitted that only a Level 1 remediation was carried
    out, the Corporation felt that there was no point in inspecting the work.  The
    Corporation then brought an application under s. 134 of the <i>Condominium
    Act</i>.  It is the dismissal of that application that is the subject of
    this appeal.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'><u>The decision under appeal</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the hearing of the application, the respondents took the position that the
    application could not proceed on the merits because s. 134(2) of the <i>Condominium
    Act</i> required that the dispute be submitted to mediation and arbitration
    before resorting to the courts.  The Corporation responded that s. 134(2)
    of the <i>Condominium Act</i> applied to disputes regarding the declaration,
    by-laws and rules of a condominium but did not apply to an application seeking
    the interpretation of the Act itself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge rejected the respondents’ objection and allowed the application
    to proceed on the basis that “the Corporation has very carefully limited
    its relief to sections 117 and 19 of the Act”.  By limiting its dispute to
    the interpretation of the Act itself, the failure to proceed to mediation
    and arbitration was not a legal impediment to the bringing of the application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her reasons, the application judge made the following relevant findings of
    fact:</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent align=left style='

line-height:normal;'>a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>there

    a risk to other residential units;</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    work done by Reliable had effectively remediated the mould contamination
    in the respondents’ units and, in any event, mould in an FCU was only an
    issue for the residents of the unit with the contaminated FCU;</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;
'>c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    Corporation’s evidence went no further than to show that the work done by
    Reliable was “not as careful or complete” as the work done by Dry Coil; it
    did not go so far as to say that the Level 1 remediation carried out by Reliable
    was insufficient to deal with the problem;</p>
  <p align=left style='

'>d)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>with
    respect to the Corporation’s concern that Reliable’s work had not included
    changes to the slope of the drain pan, there was no evidence that the drain
    pans had ever overflowed in the respondents’ units nor was there evidence
    that overflowing pans pose a risk for mould contamination to other units
    as opposed to water damage; </p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;
'>e)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>there
    was no evidence that the Board of the Corporation had considered the less
    expensive options suggested by White; and</p>
  <p align=left style='

'>f)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>there
    was no evidence that the way in which the respondents had remediated their
    units would affect the sales of units other than those of the respondents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge rejected the Corporation’s submission that, by remediating
    to a Level 1 rather than a Level 5 standard, the respondents had created
    a dangerous situation as contemplated by s. 117 of the <i>Condominium Act</i>.  She
    went on to find that this section of the Act did not empower the Board of
    the Corporation to impose a particular method of remediation where it could
    not establish that the method chosen by the respondents had not reasonably
    dealt with the problem.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:
normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge concluded that the Corporation failed to meet its onus
    of proving that a condition currently existed that was “likely to damage
    the property or cause injury to an individual”.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[3]</span></a>  In
    the event that she was wrong on this point, and that the Corporation had
    in fact established the existence of such a condition, she went on to consider
    whether the Corporation was acting reasonably so as to justify the court
    granting the discretionary relief being sought.  On this latter issue the
    application judge concluded that the Corporation had not acted reasonably
    in imposing its standard of remediation.  Central to this conclusion was
    her finding that the Board of the Corporation had failed to consider reasonable
    alternatives to the requirement that all units carry out a Level 5 remediation.  Reasonable
    lower cost alternatives ought to have been considered, especially in light
    of there being no evidence of harm to other units.</p>

line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Corporation submits that the application judge disregarded important parts
    of the evidence relevant to the issues being determined and made palpable
    and overriding errors in respect of several findings of fact.  Further, the
    Corporation maintains that, even on the facts as found, the application judge
    committed reversible error in failing to show the appropriate level of deference
    to decisions of the board of a condominium corporation in accordance with
    this court’s decision in <i>York Condominium Corp. No. 382 v. Dvorchik</i> (1997),

    challenging the application judge’s finding that there was no evidence that
    a Level 5 remediation was required, the Corporation referred to various portions
    of the evidence that, it says, demonstrate the need for a high level of remediation.  For
    example, the Corporation pointed to the evidence of Janet Valianes who testified
    that, although no report was prepared assessing the various options, she
    assumed from the fact that the consulting engineers had selected the high
    level of remediation option that they considered this level of remediation
    to be necessary.  Although such an inference could be drawn from this evidence,
    it was up to the application judge to decide.  She chose not to draw it.  Further,
    even if the application judge had drawn that inference, it would not necessarily
    translate into evidence that this high level of remediation was required
    specifically for the FCUs in the respondents’ units. </p>

line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All
    of the other evidence referred to by the Corporation in support of its submission
    on this point addresses the mould issue in a similarly global or generic
    way.  I took the application judge’s findings as applying specifically to
    the FCUs at issue in these proceedings: the FCUs located in the respondents’ units.  None
    of the evidence cited by the Corporation says that a high level of remediation
    is required for every FCU in the building nor does it specifically address
    the FCUs in the respondents’ units.  The application judge considered all
    of the evidence and chose not to draw the inference urged on her by the Corporation.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Corporation submits that, contrary to what the application judge found, the
    Adams report concludes that the Level 5 remediation was required to prevent
    the spread of mould from one unit to another.  In making this submission
    it relies principally on a statement made in his report regarding poorly
    functioning drip pans.  That statement is as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Poorly functioning
    drip pans are of a concern, as they can contribute large volumes of water
    to hidden areas within common elements or to other unit owners’
    spaces.  Water from the drip pans can lead to damage at other locations and
    possible mould growth, putting other owners at risk of damage. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>Later in his report, Adams concluded that the Reliable procedure
    “resulted in a partial solution that covered the problem and did not address
    the significant issue of overflowing drip pans.”</p>

line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Corporation submits that these excerpts are at odds with the application
    judge’s finding that, although an overflowing drip pan can contribute to
    mould growth in the vicinity of the FCU in question, nothing in Peter Adams’
    report says that “this can pose a risk for mould contamination to other residential
    units in the building, as opposed to water damage.”</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree.  The quotes from the Adams’ report are ambiguous.  They can reasonably
    support both the interpretation advanced by the Corporation and the interpretation
    made by the application judge.  The application judge understood that the
    failure to correct the slope of the drip pans could lead to water damage
    in other units.  She interpreted the statements in Adam’s report as indicating
    that, if other units suffered water damage as a result of overflowing drip
    pans, this, in turn, could lead to mould forming in those units.  This, however,
    is different from mould contamination transferring from one unit to another.  The
    application judge was focussed on the suggestion that mould can be transferred
    from unit to unit.  She concluded that the report made no allegation in that
    regard.  That was a finding open to her on the record.</p>

line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    the application had been brought pursuant to s. 117 of the Act, the application
    judge focussed on the Corporation’s concern that the presence of mould in
    the respondents’ units might affect the units of other residents or the common
    elements.  In reaching the conclusion that mould is not transferred from
    one unit to another, the application judge relied in part on a statement
    to that effect.  That statement was attributed to one of the Corporation’s
    experts, Mr. White and was contained in the unsigned minutes of a special
    meeting of unit owners produced in the course of the litigation from the
    managers’ files.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Corporation submits that the weight of the evidence is to the contrary and
    that it was inappropriate for the application judge to rely on this evidence
    rather than the evidence of another expert, Mr. Adams.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have dealt with the evidence of Mr. Adams in the previous section and found
    that it does not contradict the application judge’s finding.  With respect
    to the statement attributed to Mr. White, I find no error in the application
    judge having referred to the statement contained in the unsigned minutes.  A
    business’ records are admissible where they were made, and usually are made,
    in the ordinary course of business.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[4]</span></a>  As stated by the application judge,
    the minutes were prepared for the Corporation.  They were produced by the
    Corporation from the manager’s files and appended to her affidavit flied
    in the proceedings.  The <i>Condominium Act</i> requires the Corporation
    to keep minutes of its meetings,<a href="#_ftn5"
name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[5]</span></a> and
    there was no suggestion that the statement contained therein was not made,
    was not accurate or was not consistent with his report filed in the proceedings.</p>

line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge also found that even if there were a basis for finding
    that a condition existed in the respondents’ units that was
    “likely to damage the property or cause injury to an individual”, she would
    have exercised her discretion and would have refused to grant the relief
    sought.  This was because the Corporation had not considered less expensive
    alternatives than the one it imposed on all owners.  She found this to be
    unreasonable, particularly in light of the Corporation’s inability to show
    the existence of a risk that the mould could spread from one unit to another.</p>

    134 of the <i>Condominium Act</i> provides that compliance orders “may” be
    granted.  The application judge therefore retains a discretion and, on the
    evidentiary record and findings made, I see no basis to interfere with the
    exercise of her discretion on this point.</p>

    to the Corporation, the application judge ran afoul of the principles established
    by this court in <i>Dvorchik</i>.  The Corporation submits that <i>Dvorchik</i> stands
    for the proposition that rules are only considered to be unreasonable where
    they are contrary to the legislative scheme of the <i>Condominium Act</i> or
    are clearly unreasonable.  Unless the rule has been found to be unreasonable,
    trial judges are not entitled to substitute their opinion for that of the
    condominium corporation.</p>

    Corporation argues that, in the present case, it reached the decision that
    unit owners had to carry out Level 5 remediation based on the advice of experts.  It
    was, therefore, clearly reasonable.  This decision was in substance, if not
    in form, a rule and the application judge failed to apply the requisite deferential
    approach when evaluating this decision.  Deference was required by <i>Dvorchik</i> and
    the application judge’s decision should be set aside.</p>

    was attempting to obtain forcible entry into the respondents’ units to remedy

line-height:normal'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Dvorchik</i>,
    the Corporation applied under s. 49(1) of the then <i>Condominium Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. C.26, for an order directing the respondent to comply with
    a corporation rule that prohibited unit holders from having pets weighing
    more than twenty-five pounds.  Section 49(1) is similar to s. 134(1) of the
    current <i>Condominium Act</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    first instance, Keenan J. found the rule restricting pet size to be invalid
    and unenforceable.  He did so because the Condominium Corporation had failed
    to provide evidence proving that the twenty-five pound limit was reasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:normal'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    allowing the appeal, the Court of Appeal made the following statement about
    the deference to be paid to condominium corporations:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The condominium
    board was not obliged to hear evidence in reaching its conclusion that larger
    pets be prohibited.  In making its rules, the Board is not performing a judicial
    role, and no judicialization should be attributed either to its function
    or its process.  In an application brought under s.&nbsp;49(1), a court should
    not substitute its own opinion about the propriety of a rule enacted by a
    condominium board unless the rule is clearly unreasonable or contrary to
    the legislative scheme.  In the absence of such unreasonableness, deference
    should be paid to rules deemed appropriate by a board charged with responsibility
    for balancing the private and communal interests of the unit owners (para.
    5).</p>
  <h3 align=left style='

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court in <i>Dvorchik</i> was considering the enforcement of a rule adopted
    by a condominium corporation pursuant to s. 29(1) of the previous <i>Condominium
    Act</i> (s. 58 of the current <i>Condominium Act</i>).  The rule adopted
    in that case clearly fell within the scope of the rule-making authority of
    the condominium board.  The operative section of the Act specified that the
    condominium corporation’s rule-making power was only limited by the requirements
    that the rules be “reasonable” and “consistent” with the <i>Condominium Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      case at bar does not involve a rule, and the sections relied on by the
      Corporation do not contain language similar to s. 29 of the previous Act.  The </span><i>Dvorchik</i> decision
      is, therefore, clearly distinguishable on its facts.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left;'><span lang=EN-US>d)            Should
      the principles in </span><i>Dvorchik</i> be extended to apply in the present

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Corporation argues that its judgment that, absent a Level 5 remediation,
    a dangerous situation will be allowed to exist in those units is a reasonable
    one made with the benefit of expert advice.  As a result this decision should
    be given the same deference as provided in <i>Dvorchik</i> without regard
    to the fact that it is not a “rule” or “by-law” of the Corporation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, <i>Dvorchik</i> should not be extended to the present case.  I say
    this for two reasons.  First, the decision by the Corporation that it would
    not seek to structure the remediation requirement as a rule creates an important
    distinction from <i>Dvorchik</i>.  Second, this case raises both different
    and competing rights and duties under the <i>Condominium Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is important not to lose sight of the fact that the Corporation chose to
    frame its application as a dispute with respect to the interpretation of
    ss. 117, 119 and 134 of the <i>Condominium Act</i> and not as “a disagreement
    between the parties with respect to the declaration, by-laws or rules” of
    the corporation (see s. 132(4) of the <i>Condominium Act</i>).  Whether or
    not the remediation requirement could be made into a rule, the Corporation
    appears to have chosen not to make it a rule so as to avoid the s.&nbsp;134(2)
    requirement to go to mediation or arbitration as a precondition to any court
    application.  Thus, the Corporation’s failure to adopt the requirement for
    Level 5 remediation as a “rule” is more than semantics.  It reflects a strategic
    decision by the Corporation.  By choosing this route, the Corporation cannot
    benefit from the statutory provision relied on in <i>Dvorchik</i>.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
    importantly, in the present case, the court is being called upon to enforce
    a decision of the Corporation that, unlike <i>Dvorchik</i>, is not within
    the Corporation’s exclusive area of responsibility.  Here there are competing
    obligations and duties.  The <i>Condominium Act</i> provides that unit holders
    are responsible for the maintenance of their units.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[6]</span></a>  The Corporation only has authority
    to interfere with and override these unit holders’ responsibilities and obligations
    where the unit holder has failed in his obligation to such a degree that
    a risk outlined in s. 92(3) or a condition likely to damage the property
    or cause injury to an individual as described in s. 117 is allowed to exist
    and continue.<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a
