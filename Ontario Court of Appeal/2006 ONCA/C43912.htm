cite="mailto:Sharpe" datetime="2006-05-19T14:12">destroyed</del></span> documents relevant to an employee’s grievance.  On a preliminary motion, the arbitrator found no bad faith on the part
    of the employer but concluded that without the lost evidence, both the union’s
    ability to advance its case and the employer’s ability to defend its actions
    were “irreparably prejudiced”.  Without
    hearing the employer’s evidence on the grievance proper, the arbitrator ruled
    that the appropriate remedy was to allow the union’s grievance.  The employer applied for judicial review on
    the ground that by granting the grievance without a conducting a hearing on the
    merits, the arbitrator denied the employer’s right to natural justice.  The Divisional Court concluded that the
    arbitrator’s award was not unreasonable and refused to quash it.  The employer appeals that decision and asks
    for an order quashing the award and remitting the matter for a hearing on the
    merits.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The grievance that gives rise to this appeal has what the
    arbitrator aptly described as “a fairly long and painful past.”  The grievor, Don Larman, a long-serving
    employee of the Ministry of Family and Children’s Services (“the employer”),
    worked as one of six parole and probation officers at the employer’s parole and
    probation office in St. Catherines.  The
    grievor, a member of the respondent Ontario Public Service Employees Union
    (“the union”), was before the Grievance Settlement Board (“the Board”) on
    several prior occasions.  In April 1999
    and again in July 2001, grievances were settled on terms that required the
    employer to remove documents from the grievor’s file and prohibited the
    employer from relying on those documents in the future.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;&quot;\[%2\:3\:0\:\]&quot; Sharpe 20060519T1411'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the basis of findings in an investigative report dated
    November 15, 2001, the employer alleged that the grievor had breached a term of
    the July 2001 settlement, disciplined the grievor and transferred him to
    another office in Simcoe.  The grievor
    filed two grievances against that decision.  Those grievances were settled on February 22, 2002.  A term of the settlement was that the
    employer would hire an outside workplace review consultant to assess the
    situation at the employee’s home office.  The employer agreed that it would not take any disciplinary or punitive
    action based on the allegations contained in the November 15, 2001
    investigative report and that it would not give that report to the workplace
    review consultant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The employer entered into a written consulting contract with
    Mediated Solutions Incorporated to conduct the workplace review.  The Mediated Solutions Workplace Review
    Report of July 23, 2002, recommended that the grievor should be relocated
    laterally to another office in view of the history of conflict in his home
    office.  It concluded that as the
    grievor had “been at the centre of past and present conflict”, returning him to
    the same office “would unnecessarily disrupt the healing process” and that
    there was “too much water under the bridge to repair the working relationship”
    between the grievor and his former colleagues.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The employer implemented this recommendation and temporarily
    assigned the grievor to another office.  The grievor immediately grieved this decision, essentially on the ground
    that the employer had violated the terms of the February 22, 2002 settlement
    that no disciplinary or punitive action be taken on the basis of the
    allegations contained in the November 15, 2001 investigative report and that
    that report would not be given to the workplace review consultant. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The union demanded disclosure of all relevant documents.  The employer initially refused
    disclosure.  The grievor filed a second
    grievance alleging breach of the terms of the collective agreement requiring
    disclosure.  On the first hearing date,
    counsel for the union requested further disclosure and the matter was adjourned
    to afford the employer time to search for the documents. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The contract between the employer and Mediated Solutions
    provided that Mediated Solutions was to maintain confidentiality over all
    documents and communications and was “not to destroy any material or information
    which is the property of [the employer] without [the employer’s] prior written
    approval”.  Contrary to this contractual
    obligation, Mediated Solutions destroyed all documents it received and, in
    keeping with its usual practice, it also destroyed all notes made by those
    conducting the review.  The employer
    advised the union that all documents provided to Mediated Solutions had been
    destroyed.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the basis of that information, the union moved to have the
    grievances granted on the basis that the employer had failed to produce
    relevant documents.  On the union’s
    motion to allow the grievances on the grounds of non-disclosure, the employer
    called Dave Hopkins, the manager of the St. Catherines office and the individual
    who had provided documents to Mediated Solutions for the purposes of its
    review.  Hopkins testified that “to the
    best of [his] recollection” he provided all documents electronically without an
    accompanying letter or list.  While
    Hopkins was not “100%” sure, he was “fairly confident” that that was all he had
    provided and that he had not included the forbidden materials from the earlier
    settlement.  He did not keep a list of
    what he sent but he produced the documents he believed he had forwarded to Mediated
    Solutions.  He also testified that
    pursuant to the terms of the earlier settlement he had destroyed a number of
    documents.<ins cite="mailto:soobraa" datetime="2006-06-23T12:21"> </ins> No evidence was called to suggest that any
    other documents had been provided to Mediated Solutions. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The union submitted that without knowing precisely what
    documents had been provided to Mediated Solutions, the union could not advance
    its case and that to proceed with the hearing would constitute a denial of
    natural justice and an abuse of process.  The union asked the arbitrator to allow the grievance on grounds of
    non-disclosure.  The employer submitted
    that those interviewed by the reviewers and the reviewers themselves were
    available to give <i>viva voce</i> evidence as to the documents that had been
    provided and that conducting a full hearing on the merits would afford both
    parties the right to a full hearing on the employer’s decision to relocate the
    grievor.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The arbitrator ruled that the grievances should be allowed on
    the ground of non-disclosure.  In her
    view, the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Carosella</i>,
    [1997] 1 S.C.R. 80, granting a stay of sexual assault charges on the ground
    that relevant material resulted in breach of the accused’s constitutional right
    to full answer and defence, was “instructive”.  She noted that while <i>Carosella</i> arose in a criminal law context,
    “the principles explored there do have some applicability to the instant
    matter” as the “right to a fair hearing includes the right to advance one’s
    case and the right to respond.” </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The arbitrator found that while the employer should have been
    more careful to identify the documents it did provide the consultant, the
    employer had asked the consultant not to destroy documents.  The arbitrator concluded that the employer
    did not intentionally disregard its duty to disclose, <span class=msoDel><del

    been destroyed, there was “simply no way to be certain, with any degree of
    confidence, what documents were actually provided.”  She concluded that the destruction of the documents “irreparably
    damaged” the union’s ability to advance its case and the employer’s ability to
    defend its actions: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Without knowing
    the <i>full</i> extent of what was relayed to the reviewers, the basis upon
    which Mediated Solutions made its recommendations cannot be determined. Without
    knowing the complete basis upon which Mediated Solutions made its
    recommendations, it cannot be determined whether the employer based its decision
    to relocate Mr. Larman on prohibited information… [W]ithout knowing the full
    extent of what was relayed to the reviewers, neither the union nor the employer
    can have a full and fair hearing on the central issues in dispute. Likewise,
    this Board will not be able to determine if there was a breach of the
    settlement and determine the merits of the case.</p>

    breached the earlier settlement or destroyed documents to thwart the
    arbitration, the arbitrator concluded that as the destruction of the documents
    precluded the possibility of a full and fair hearing, and as there was no
    alternate remedy, the only appropriate remedy was to grant the grievance. </p>

    para. 56) “</span>a decision to obstruct the course of justice by
    systematically destroying evidence which the practices of the court might
    require to be produced.”  Here, the
    arbitrator expressly found that the documents in question were lost through

    the arbitration process. <ins cite="mailto:soobraa" datetime="2006-06-23T12:17"> </ins>Second, <i>Carosella</i> dealt with the
    infringement of a <i>Charter</i> right in relation to a serious criminal
    charge.  While the grievor’s right to be
    treated fairly by his employer is an important one, it does not rise to the
    same level as that of a criminal accused invoking a breach of <i>Charter</i> rights.  Third, at issue in this case is
    the need to reconcile the competing claims to natural justice of the grievor
    and his employer in a civil context, not the rights of an individual accused
    pitted against the state in a criminal law setting as in <i>Carosella</i>.
    Fourth, <i>Carosella</i> involved the notes taken of an interview involving an
    historic sexual assault where the individual who took the notes had no
    recollection whatsoever of the interview. <ins cite="mailto:soobraa"

    cross-examined to determine the extent to which they relied on the prohibited
    information, if at all.  In addition,
    the report produced by Mediated Solutions was available to the union.  It also could have been used to identify
    inconsistencies and test evidence.  Witnesses were available from the Ministry to testify about what
    documents had been provided to the consultants.  Other Ministry employees could have been cross-examined on the
    issue of whether the prohibited information formed any part of their
    discussions with the consultants.  In
    the end, if there remained any significant doubt about whether or not the
    employer had violated the terms of the settlement by providing the consultant
    with forbidden information, the arbitrator could have drawn an adverse
    inference against the employer on the ground that the documents had been
    destroyed and allowed the grievance on that basis.  In my view, it was an error meriting the intervention of judicial

    sought to be advanced by the union, the relevance of the destroyed material to

    Court of Canada unpacked the concept of reasonableness.  As described there, an unreasonable decision
    is one that, in the main, is not supported by any reasons that can stand up to a
    somewhat probing examination. The reviewing court looks to see whether any of
    the reasons given by the tribunal adequately support the decision being
    reviewed.  The court should not at any
    point ask itself what the correct decision would have been.  See <i>Ryan</i>, paragraphs 48, 49 and
    50.  The court summarized this at
    paragraph 55:</ins></p>

    of analysis within the given reasons that could reasonably lead the tribunal
    from the evidence before it to the conclusion at which it arrived.  If any of the reasons that are sufficient to
    support the conclusion are tenable in the sense that they can stand up to a
    somewhat probing examination, then the decision will not be unreasonable and a
    reviewing court must not interfere  (see <i>Southam</i>, at para. 56).  This means that
    a decision may satisfy the reasonableness standard if it is supported by a
    tenable explanation even if this explanation is not one that the reviewing
    court finds compelling (see <i>Southam</i>, at para. 79).</ins></p>

    I have said, the arbitrator first concluded that the Ministry was legally
    responsible for the reviewers’ destruction of their notes of their interviews
    with employees of the St. Catherines office, the documents received from the
    Ministry and for not keeping a record of the documents forwarded.  The Ministry was thus in breach of its
    disclosure obligation under the collective agreement.  She then turned to the remedial issue.</ins></p>

    reiterated that the union’s case on the transfer grievance was that the
    Ministry’s transfer of the grievor, which was admittedly based on the
    reviewer’s report, violated the three settlements as well as constituting
    discrimination and unjust discipline. The Ministry had agreed not to rely on
    the incidents that were the subject of the settlements and to destroy certain documents
    and not supply them to the reviewers.  It was vital to the union’s case to establish that employees had
    discussed the incidents with the reviewers, that the reviewers had received
    certain documents and that both were used in preparing their report.</ins></p>

    this, the arbitrator found that the destroyed material was central to the
    union’s case.  It provided a critical
    basis for cross-examination of both the employees and the reviewers to test
    what information was passed and the extent to which the reviewers had relied on
    it.</ins></p>

    arbitrator then considered whether there were other remedies that would cure
    the prejudice caused by the Ministry’s breach.  None were suggested by the Ministry. The arbitrator examined the taking
    of adverse inferences but found that wanting on the specific facts of this
    case.  She then concluded that the
    appropriate remedy for the breach was to grant the transfer grievance and
    return the grievor to his position in the St. Catherines office as soon as
    practical.</ins></p>

    my view, this decision meets the standard of reasonableness.  It was reasonable for the arbitrator to find
    that for the union to make its case that the reviewers had received and acted
    on documents and information in contravention of the settlements,
    cross-examination was critical. The reviewers were agents of the Ministry, and,
    given the damaged relationships between the grievor and his colleagues in the
    St. Catherines office, many of the employees interviewed may also have been
    opposed in interest to the grievor.</ins></p>

    was equally reasonable for the arbitrator to view the destroyed material as a
    critical tool in cross-examination since it carried the accuracy of
    contemporary records and was assembled without thought to the allegations to be
    made by the union in the transfer grievance.  </ins></p>

    I think it was reasonable for the arbitrator to conclude that no other remedy
    would cure the prejudice. None was suggested by the Ministry, and she concluded
    that the alternative of drawing adverse inferences would not do the same job.  While another arbitrator could reasonably
    conclude that there were alternatives that would cure the prejudice every bit
    as well, I do not think it was unreasonable for this arbitrator to decide
    otherwise in these circumstances.</ins></p>

    my view, she was entitled to choose the remedy she did rather than others
    which, while they might go some distance and might serve the Ministry’s
    interest in having a hearing of the transfer grievance on the merits, would not
    in her view completely cure the prejudice to the union.  The arbitrator after all was fashioning a
    remedy for the Ministry’s breach of the collective agreement.  To seek to provide full redress to the union
    without regard for the interest of the breaching party does not seem to me
    unreasonable.  </ins></p>
