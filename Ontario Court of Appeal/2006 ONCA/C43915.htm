  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>WEILER J.A.:</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE NATURE OF THE APPEAL AND
    CROSS&#8209;APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown appeals both the trial judge’s finding of liability for
    breach of contract and his award of $2.52 million as damages plus $400,000
    punitive damages against it.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to liability, the Crown submits that the trial
    judge erred in finding that Industry Canada breached its contractual
    obligations to CivicLife.com Inc. (“CivicLife”), an internet software
    developer, by deliberately and secretly undermining the objectives of their
    agreement and by implying a term of good faith on the part of Industry Canada
    in carrying out the contract.  With
    respect to damages, the Crown submits that CivicLife was paid the full amount
    under the contract and the trial judge erred in awarding any damages for the
    Industry Canada’s alleged failure to properly test the software CivicLife
    developed.  The Crown further submits that
    the trial judge grounded his award of punitive damages on the very same conduct
    he used to conclude that Industry Canada had breached its contract, namely
    breach of an implied duty of good faith, and that he erred in law in holding
    that breach of the duty of good faith entitled CivicLife to punitive
    damages.  In addition, the Crown submits
    that the amount of punitive damages is not rational. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CivicLife cross-appeals the award of damages on the basis that
    although the trial judge awarded it compensation for the money it spent and the
    pilot tests it was promised, no award was made to address the value and
    opportunity that CivicLife once had, but lost, because of Industry Canada’s
    failure to perform the contract in good faith.  CivicLife seeks additional damages of $14,520,000, on the basis that
    CivicLife was worth this amount and was destroyed, plus $4,000,000 for the
    reasonable expectation that a national rollout of the software would occur.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the Crown’s
    appeal with respect to liability and damages but I would allow the appeal with
    respect to punitive damages.  I would
    dismiss the cross-appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s decision is reported at [2005] O.J. No.
    3485.  The following background is
    sufficient for the purposes of this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Starting in the mid 1990s, the Information Highway
    Applications Branch (“IHAB”) of Industry Canada put in place a number of
    on-line programs intended to make the internet accessible to schools and
    communities and to encourage the use of the internet.  The director of IHAB, Doug Hull, envisioned that a program known
    as “Access.ca” would make all information and services of federal ministries
    and agencies accessible on-line.  In
    order to do so, a portal had to be created.  In 1999, a pilot of such a portal was attempted in Prince Edward Island
    by SmartSources.com Technologies Inc. (“SmartSources”), another software
    developer.  IHAB decided to proceed
    further with the project.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In May 1999, Mr.&nbsp;Hull met Kevin&nbsp;Higgins, the
    president of FreeBalance, a software company that was already working on a
    software application that could be used to access government services.  In September 1999, Mr. Hull attended a
    demonstration of the FreeBalance prototype and was impressed by it.  Because the FreeBalance board of directors
    decided not to take on the Industry Canada project, Mr. Higgins resigned his
    position and in January 2000, he incorporated CivicLife with two other former
    FreeBalance executives.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Industry Canada decided that CivicLife would be the prime
    contractor of the portal and that SmartSources would provide two specific
    components for the portal, a search engine and a context information
    manager.  CivicLife’s responsibility was
    to integrate the two components supplied by SmartSources and deliver a
    completed portal ready for implementation of pilot projects at up to twenty
    different sites across Canada. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Negotiations led to five contracts signed on February 4,
    2000.  Industry Canada<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a> entered into two supply agreements, one with CivicLife and one with
    SmartSources.  According to the
    provisions of the two supply agreements, the portal was to be delivered in
    stages with the final product due May 31, 2000.  In return, Industry Canada agreed to pay $1.52 million to
    CivicLife in one supply agreement and $0.5 million to SmartSources in the
    other.  Aside from the cost of the
    contract, the supply agreements were identical.  Similarly, Industry Canada entered into an Intellectual Property
    (“I.P.”) agreement with each of CivicLife and SmartSources.  The fifth contract was a development and
    commercial agreement between SmartSources and CivicLife.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The development of the portal did not proceed as
    anticipated.  Despite the tight time
    frame envisaged by the contract, SmartSources and CivicLife did not work together.  On July 14, 2000, Industry Canada brought
    together representatives of  SmartSources and CivicLife.  At
    that meeting, the parties orally agreed to a “minimal integration approach”
    whereby the two companies would work on their software independently and later
    link them by remote access.  Industry
    Canada requested that Xwave, the independent software technology company it had
    retained to evaluate the portal software, assist the parties in devising a
    technical plan for integrating the two products.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 18, 2001, CivicLife advised that it had been unable
    to integrate the SmartSources search engine into its software.  In May 2001, it delivered a portal software
    program using an off-the-shelf search engine.  After some modifications, Xwave approved the CivicLife portal and
    Industry Canada ultimately paid the remaining amount owing under the contract.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Instead of supplying Industry Canada with the two components
    it had agreed to provide, in early 2001 SmartSources provided Industry Canada
    with an entirely separate stand-alone portal using its search engine and
    context information manager.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The CivicLife and SmartSources portals were each independently
    tested at only two separate pilot locations.  CivicLife was hired to launch the two pilot tests of its portal for
    $390,000.  Industry Canada did not
    involve CivicLife in any further expansion of the Access.ca program.  CivicLife ultimately went into receivership.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>SUMMARY OF THE TRIAL DECISION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The following is a summary of the salient portions of the trial
    judge’s reasons.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The context in which the
    agreement came to be</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Throughout the period of negotiation, Mr.&nbsp;Hull, who had
    the authority to negotiate this deal with CivicLife, represented that the
    national rollout was going to take place.  CivicLife understood, and Industry Canada was fully aware of CivicLife’s
    understanding, that the national rollout was an integral and fundamental term
    of the deal.  There was no real money in
    the development of the portal.  The real
    money was in the marketing of the portal after rollout and in numerous
    incidental economic opportunities that would arise in Canada and abroad from
    the wide use of the CivicLife portal in Canada.  The I.P. agreements were, therefore, “the golden egg” of the
    transaction.  All parties understood that
    the full potential of the I.P. agreements could only be achieved with the
    national rollout.  This is obvious from
    the very large revenue projections conveyed by the Assistant Deputy Minister to
    the Deputy Minister.  A careful reading
    of the memorandum of offering issued by CivicLife clearly shows that the
    cornerstone of CivicLife’s overall business plan was the national rollout,
    which was expected to provide the impetus and groundwork from which all
    revenues would emerge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The five contracts signed February 4, 2000 represent one
    contractual arrangement.  Interpretation
    of one must take into account the terms and conditions of the four others.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>What legal obligations did
    Industry Canada breach?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the parties anticipated and firmly believed that
    Access.ca would be launched nationwide, the agreement did not go so far as to
    impose on Industry Canada the legal obligation to proceed with the national
    launch.  The national launch remained
    contingent on the performance of CivicLife, SmartSources and “other planning
    considerations”, which included final Treasury Board approvals and the
    continued support of the government officials.  CivicLife assumed the risk that the national rollout might not occur if
    certain of those conditions were not met.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was a term of the agreement that Industry Canada would act
    fairly and take all reasonable steps to achieve the objectives of the agreement
    and the expectations of the parties.  Simply paying the amount owed under the contract to CivicLife was not
    the sum total of Industry Canada’s legal obligations.  It was an implied term of the agreement that Industry Canada
    would at all times deal fairly with CivicLife in order not to nullify the
    reasonable expectations that Industry Canada had itself fostered.  Industry Canada breached this implied term
    and the duty of good faith it owed to CivicLife in many respects.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Roger&nbsp;Casselman, the Industry Canada representative who
    was responsible for the deliverables from CivicLife and SmartSources, with the
    acquiescence of his IHAB supervisors, deliberately encouraged SmartSources to
    provide its own portal.  By doing so,
    Industry Canada destroyed the relationship of trust and cooperation required
    between SmartSources and CivicLife to accomplish integration of the
    SmartSources components.  The secret
    “un-official” emails between Mr. Casselman and SmartSources’ principal,
    Nathan&nbsp;Nifco, paint a picture of deceit and sabotage.  CivicLife took all reasonable steps it could
    to integrate the SmartSources components.  If not for the deliberately uncooperative attitude of SmartSources,
    integration could have been completed within two to three months of May 31,
    2000.  SmartSources’ decision not to
    cooperate in the integration was promoted and encouraged by Industry
    Canada.  Further, Industry Canada encouraged
    SmartSources to supply its stand-alone portal in direct breach of the terms of
    the agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As part of the bargain, it is reasonable to conclude that
    CivicLife would obtain a properly tested portal at the end of the deal.  Accordingly, it was a term of the agreement
    that Industry Canada would act fairly and reasonably in proceeding to
    adequately test CivicLife’s portal.  To
    be adequately tested, the portal had to undergo a substantial number of pilots.  Section 4 of the supply agreement
    contemplates the requirement for a substantial amount of pilot testing,
    specifically, up to twenty pilot trials in communities across Canada.  It is meaningful that the last sentence in
    s.&nbsp;4 reads, “The Intellectual Property Agreement provides the terms and
    conditions of the use of the Intellectual property by the Parties.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Industry Canada failed to adequately test the portal.  On the one hand, it tested a competitor’s
    portal in clear breach of the agreement and, on the other, it only tested
    CivicLife’s portal at two pilot locations.  That was clearly inadequate testing well below what was contemplated by
    the agreement.  There is cogent evidence
    Industry Canada knew that the testing was inadequate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CivicLife was never notified it had not met its part of the
    bargain.  Industry Canada never
    terminated the agreement.  To the
    contrary, throughout the relevant period Industry Canada continued to encourage
    CivicLife to proceed with the project.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Industry Canada never provided any evidence to explain:
    (a)&nbsp;what position it took when the portal was not delivered on May 31,
    2000; (b)&nbsp;whether it ever rejected or found fault with any of the products
    supplied by CivicLife; (c)&nbsp;why it decided to ask SmartSources to provide a
    stand-alone portal; (d)&nbsp;why it proceeded only with the pilots it did; and
    (e)&nbsp;why it did not proceed with the national launch. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Industry Canada was required to act fairly and take all
    reasonable steps to achieve the objectives of the agreement.  These objectives included working
    cooperatively in the development, supply and commercialization of the Civic
    Portal so as to have it ready to market.  Industry Canada breached its duty of good faith and in many respects,
    particularly in its dealings with SmartSources, deliberately took steps to
    nullify the contractual objectives.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Specifically, Industry Canada breached its duty of good faith
    in the following ways:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>(a)       It deliberately and secretly interfered
    with the relationship between SmartSources and CivicLife thereby significantly
    contributing to CivicLife’s failure to integrate the SmartSources components;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>(b)       It encouraged SmartSources to compete
    with CivicLife by soliciting and accepting from SmartSources another portal; </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>(c)       When dealing with SmartSources, Industry
    Canada deliberately kept these transactions secret; </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>(d)       It failed to notify CivicLife that it
    contemplated not proceeding with the national launch and instead communicated
    with CivicLife in such a way as to indicate that the project was proceeding as
    planned; and </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>(e)       It failed to adequately test CivicLife’s
    portal and proceeded to test the portal supplied by SmartSources.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Damages</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The general principle governing the award of damages for
    breach of contract is that the complaining party should, insofar as can be done
    by money, be placed in the same position as if the contract had been performed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The damages that are recoverable are the losses a reasonable
    person at the time of making the contract would contemplate as being a serious
    possibility.  Once a foreseeable
    consequence occurs, all the damages of that kind are recoverable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CivicLife claims damages under three main headings.  The first of these claims relates to alleged
    wasted expenditures.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CivicLife incurred expenditures that it would not have had to
    make but for Industry Canada’s interference between CivicLife and
    SmartSources.  CivicLife identified
    seven specific items in its quantification of the alleged loss.  All of these sums, totalling $3,130,712.90,
    are said to have been spent during the life of the project over and above the
    amounts received from Industry Canada under the contract.  Industry Canada did not challenge the actual
    quantification and validity of these expenses.  CivicLife spent the amounts claimed.  The question was:  What amounts
    could be said to flow directly from Industry Canada’s breach?  The trial judge was not satisfied that three
    of the items flowed directly from Industry Canada’s breach.  In addition, some of the additional
    expenditures were incurred as a result of Xwave’s deficiency reports.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge accepted CivicLife’s evidence that the
    external beta version of the portal could have been delivered as required
    within approximately two to three months after the original deadline of
    May&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2000.  A good
    proportion of the deficiencies noted by Xwave were due to the integration
    difficulties.  Industry Canada was
    obliged to assume responsibility for those.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result of the Crown’s breach, it took CivicLife at least
    double the time and resources to finally obtain approval of the portal.  In the circumstances, it was just and
    reasonable to double the cost of the contract from $1.52 million to $3.04
    million.  CivicLife’s damages under this
    head were therefore fixed at $1.52 million.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second claim was for the loss of three types of
    opportunities related to the contract, namely: (a)&nbsp;Pilot and Post Pilot
    Enhancement; (b)&nbsp;National Rollout; and (c)&nbsp;Community Program.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The last two items can only arise if Industry Canada had a
    legal obligation to proceed with the national rollout.  Since it did not, no damages can be awarded
    for these two items.  The same applies
    to post pilot enhancements, which would only have been carried out in final
    preparation for the national rollout.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the claim for the loss of pilot testing, if Industry
    Canada had performed its contractual obligation to properly test the portal at
    least one pilot would have proceeded in each province and likely two in Quebec
    and Ontario, for a total of twelve pilots.  Brian&nbsp;Awrey’s (CivicLife’s Chief Financial Officer) estimate of a
    financial return of $100,000 per pilot is very reasonable.  That estimate was in no way challenged by
    Industry Canada.  CivicLife would likely
    have been retained to proceed with all pilots.  Taking into account the two pilots carried out (for which CivicLife was
    paid $390,000), damages under this head were fixed at $1 million. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CivicLife’s final claim was for punitive damages.  The law is clear that in commercial contract
    cases punitive damages should only be awarded in the most exceptional
    circumstances and only for very harsh and outrageous conduct.  This is such a case.  Instead of treating CivicLife fairly,
    Industry Canada engaged in very oppressive and highhanded conduct.  For instance:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>(a)       Industry Canada engaged in a deliberate
    and protracted course of duplicitous conduct;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>(b)       The conduct was aimed at destroying the
    very core of the reasonable expectations that CivicLife was entitled to hold; </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>(c)       The misconduct was carried out in secret
    while all along Industry Canada was telling CivicLife the project was
    proceeding as agreed, and when CivicLife learned of the portal submitted by
    SmartSources, Industry Canada invented a false story to convince CivicLife that
    its position was not altered;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>(d)       Even though Industry Canada knew
    CivicLife was in dire financial straits and needed to be told the truth as soon
    as possible, it deliberately chose not to respond to CivicLife’s many letters
    and kept silent to allow CivicLife to drown in useless and expensive attempts
    to keep the project alive. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown chose not to call one single officer to try to give
    a reasonable explanation for Industry Canada’s conduct.  (Those that were called were called by
    CivicLife as adverse witnesses.)  The
    court can only conclude that Industry Canada did not have any explanation to
    offer for its outrageous conduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>$400,000 is a just amount of punitive damages to denounce
    Industry Canada’s very high handed and oppressive conduct.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More specifically, the Crown’s submissions concerning the
    trial judge’s findings respecting the conduct of Industry Canada and my
    response are as follows: </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>1.         <b>Crown:</b> Industry Canada was
    entitled to communicate privately with SmartSources.  These secret communications did not breach any term of the agreement
    it had with CivicLife.  It was a term of
    the commercial and development agreement between SmartSources and CivicLife
    that SmartSources communicate all pertinent information to CivicLife.  Industry Canada had no such obligation.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><b>Response:</b> This submission ignores: (a)&nbsp;the fact that the supply agreements with each
    of CivicLife and SmartSources specifically required that all five agreements be
    read together; (b)&nbsp;the purpose of the secret communications between
    Industry Canada and SmartSources which was to encourage SmartSources to provide
    its own portal in direct breach of the terms of the agreement; and (c)&nbsp;the
    expectations of the parties set out in the supply agreement between Industry
    Canada and CivicLife.  In addition, the
    communications had the effect of undermining Industry Canada’s obligation under
    the I.P. agreement to assist CivicLife with the commercialization of its
    portal.  Mr.&nbsp;Casselman testified at
    trial that he understood that CivicLife must be a part of or advised of all
    cogent communications made between SmartSources and Industry Canada, and he
    admitted that part of his responsibility was to keep the contractors equally
    informed.  Yet, as found by the trial
    judge, when CivicLife learned of the portal submitted by SmartSources, Industry
    Canada invented a false story to cover up what was happening.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>2.         <b>Crown:</b> There is no evidence to
    support the finding that Mr. Casselman set out to sabotage CivicLife.  In Mr. Casselman’s view, the integration
    problems were due to CivicLife’s failure to communicate with SmartSources.  Mr. Casselman understood that his role on
    the Access.ca project was to ensure that Industry Canada got what it paid
    for.  To elevate his intention to one of
    deliberate sabotage is a patently unreasonable interpretation of the evidence.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><b>Response: </b>Upon
    becoming engaged in the project, Mr. Casselman stated that it was his intention
    to redirect the Access.ca project in support of SmartSources, but at trial he
    was not able to identify what information, if any, he used to form his stated
    preference for the SmartSources architecture.  A substantial email record established his involvement in forming an
    agreement with SmartSources to develop a secret competing portal.  Mr.&nbsp;Casselman’s conduct was contrary to
    the supply agreement between Industry Canada and CivicLife that required
    CivicLife and SmartSources to have clearly defined roles, and which specified
    the individual elements that each party was to contribute to the overall
    deliverables.  The agreement further
    required that any changes be done by mutual agreement between the parties.  Industry Canada’s decision to encourage
    SmartSources to develop a competing portal was a change that was not done by
    mutual agreement between the parties.  The trial judge correctly found that Industry Canada’s agreement with
    SmartSources to produce a competing portal was in direct breach of the terms of
    their overall agreement.  Further, in
    the I.P. agreement, Industry Canada agreed “to use its best efforts to assist CivicLife
    during the currency of [the] Agreement with the commercialization of the Civic
    Portal Software and to make available its expertise and marketing materials in
    connection therewith.”  By plotting to
    replace the CivicLife portal with a SmartSources portal, Mr.&nbsp;Casselman did
    the opposite. </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>3.         <b>Crown:</b> As the project went on,
    Mr. Casselman eventually became frustrated with CivicLife’s failure to deliver
    what was required by the CivicLife supply agreement.  However, CivicLife only raised the integration problems they were
    having with SmartSources in June 2000, after CivicLife failed to deliver the
    external beta software incorporating SmartSources’ components by
    May&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2000.  In
    Mr.&nbsp;Casselman’s view, these problems were due to CivicLife’s failure to
    communicate with SmartSources.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><b>Response:</b> See my response above.  Further, the
    trial judge accepted the evidence of CivicLife’s Karl&nbsp;Gretton, as he was
    entitled to do, that Mr.&nbsp;Gretton took all reasonable steps he could to
    integrate the SmartSources components.  The trial judge further found that CivicLife could have completed the
    integration within approximately two or three months of May 31, 2000, well in
    advance of the end of December 2000 (the date the pilots were to begin), had it
    not been for the deliberately uncooperative attitude of SmartSources.  On the evidence, the trial judge was
    entitled to come to the conclusion he did.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>4.         <b>Crown:</b> The trial judge’s finding
    that but for Mr. Casselman’s communications with SmartSources and SmartSources’
    resulting intransigence, CivicLife would have been able to complete the portal
    within two to three months of the initial completion date of May 31, 2000
    contrasts with the evidence of Xwave, the third-party company retained to
    independently assess CivicLife’s portal.  </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><b>Response:</b> While early Xwave reports were critical of CivicLife’s progress, a good
    proportion of the deficiencies noted by Xwave were due to difficulties
    encountered with integration, for which the trial judge found Industry Canada
    solely responsible.  In addition, Mr.
    Casselman instructed Xwave to test CivicLife’s components against a standard of
    100&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent completion even though the product was in early stages
    of development.  In the end, CivicLife
    passed Xwave’s final report, and another report prepared by Communications
    Research Centre Canada praised CivicLife deliverables.  The fact is CivicLife did deliver a
    stand-alone portal that was approved by the independent body chosen by Industry
    Canada to test it.  As I have already
    indicated, the trial judge was entitled to make the finding that, but for the
    actions of Mr.&nbsp;Casselman and SmartSources, CivicLife’s completion of the
    portal would have been much more timely. </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>5.         <b>Crown:</b> The trial judge’s
    conclusion that Industry Canada acted deliberately to undermine the objectives
    of the contract is contrary to the evidence of Mr. Casselman (of Industry
    Canada), Mr. Nifco (of SmartSources) and David Klein (of Xwave, the independent
    assessor of CivicLife’s software).</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><b>Response:</b> The fact that the trial judge’s conclusion is contrary to the evidence of
    Messrs.&nbsp;Casselman, Nifco and Klein is not of itself a palpable and
    overriding error.  It is not enough that
    there is a difference of opinion with the trial judge:  <i>Schwartz v. Canada</i>,<i> </i>[1996] 1
    S.C.R. 254 at paras. 32-33; <i>H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General)</i>,<i> </i>[2005]
    1 S.C.R. 401 at para. 74.  A core
    function of a trial judge is to accept all, part or none of the evidence of a
    witness. </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>6.         <b>Crown:</b> The trial judge gave no
    explanation for finding Mr. Nifco not credible.  The reasons for decision provide no insight into the fact-finding
    process that led to his conclusion.  Mr.
    Nifco testified that it was never SmartSources’ objective to take over the
    Access.ca project.  In July 2000, he
    raised concerns about the platform upon which CivicLife had chosen to build the
    portal and also stated he had doubts about CivicLife’s commitment to working
    with SmartSources.  He only agreed to
    provide a stand-alone portal once it became clear that CivicLife could not do
    so.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><b>Response:</b> Overall, the trial judge gave detailed reasons on credibility.  The trial judge’s reasons for rejecting the
    evidence of Mr.&nbsp;Casselman, an adverse witness, and for accepting the
    evidence of CivicLife’s witness, Mr.&nbsp;Higgins, apply in large measure to
    Mr.&nbsp;Nifco, a witness whose self-interest in the project was obvious.  The trial judge is not required to comment
    on the evidence of each and every witness. Reasons for judgment are not a
    running commentary on the trial process but are intended to explain the result
    arrived at: <i>Waxman v. Waxman</i>, [2004] O.J. No. 1765 at para.&nbsp;283
    (C.A.).  </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>There is evidence
    that in May 2000, Mr. Nifco was having discussions with Industry Canada about
    the delivery of a SmartSources portal without CivicLife’s involvement.  Up to that point, SmartSources had not
    provided its deliverables and had not cooperated in integrating its
    deliverables with the CivicLife portal.  Industry Canada never gave evidence as to what position it took when the
    portal was not delivered on May 31, 2000. The supply agreement provided for
    “Excusable Delays” when a party is prevented from performing a contractual
    obligation by circumstances beyond its reasonable control.  No submissions were addressed to this
    provision.  CivicLife did in fact
    deliver a stand-alone portal that was approved by the independent body (Xwave) chosen
    by Industry Canada to test it, and no evidence was led by the Crown that the
    delay in production, for which Industry Canda was in large measure responsible,
    meant that the project was no longer practicable.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>7.         <b>Crown:</b>  CivicLife failed to design software to integrate the SmartSources
    components.  Mr. Klein testified that
    CivicLife’s lack of documentation describing how the CivicLife and SmartSources
    software would fit together was “a key element that would affect
    integration”.  The trial judge’s inflation
    of the role SmartSources played in CivicLife’s delay is inconsistent with Mr.
    Higgins’ own evidence that SmartSources’ two components were relatively minor
    in the context of the overall Access.ca project.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><b>Response: </b> The trial judge was entitled to find, as he
    did, that CivicLife was to be the prime contractor on the project.  This accorded with the contracts and the
    amounts paid to each party. The trial judge’s finding in this regard is in no
    way inconsistent with his finding concerning the role SmartSources played in
    CivicLife’s delay. The trial judge was entitled to accept the evidence of Mr.
    Gretton that all reasonable steps had been taken by CivicLife to integrate the
    SmartSources components.  There is no
    evidence that Industry Canada found fault with CivicLife’s portal despite the
    fact that it did not integrate the SmartSources software.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In conclusion, the essence of the Crown’s appeal is an attempt
    to show that the trial judge made a palpable and overriding error in finding
    that Industry Canada secretly and deliberately undermined the contractual
    framework of its agreement with CivicLife.  I have reviewed the Crown’s main challenges directed to the trial
    judge’s findings of fact above.  The
    trial judge made no clear and obvious errors. The Crown has failed to meet the
    high standard required to overturn these findings of fact. The trial judge was
    entitled to come to the conclusion he did that there was a causal link between
    Industry Canada’s conduct and CivicLife’s delayed performance.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(2)       Did the trial judge err in law in holding

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted previously, the trial judge held that Industry Canada
    breached its duty of good faith in the following ways:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>(a)       It deliberately and secretly interfered
    with the relationship between SmartSources and CivicLife thereby significantly
    contributing to CivicLife’s failure to integrate the SmartSources components;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>(b)       It encouraged SmartSources to compete
    with CivicLife by soliciting and accepting from SmartSources another portal; </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>(c)       When dealing with SmartSources, Industry
    Canada deliberately kept these transactions secret;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>(d)       It failed to notify CivicLife that it
    contemplated not proceeding with the national launch and instead communicated
    with CivicLife in such a way as to indicate that the project was proceeding as
    planned; and</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>(e)       It failed to adequately test CivicLife’s
    portal and proceeded to test the portal supplied by SmartSources.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown submits that it was not a specific term of the contracts
    that it act in good faith and that by implying a term to act in good faith, the
    trial judge added a substantive, unbargained for contractual term to the
    contracts. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The question of when a term may be implied in a contract was
    considered by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>M.J.B. Enterprises Ltd. v.
    Defence Construction (1951) Ltd., </i>[1999] 1 S.C.R. 619.  The issue was whether a “privilege clause”,
    which allowed the person calling for tenders to disregard the lowest bid in
    favour of any other tender, allowed acceptance of a non&#8209;compliant tender
    or whether the court should imply terms.  In coming to its conclusion that there was an implied term only
    compliant tenders would be accepted, the court confirmed its decision in <i>Canadian
    Pacific Hotels Ltd. v. Bank of Montreal, </i>[1987] 1 S.C.R. 711, as to when a
    term may be implied in a contract.  One
    of the bases for implying a term is presumed intention – <i>i.e.</i> “the
    implication of a term as necessary to give business efficacy to a contract or
    as otherwise meeting the ‘officious bystander’ test as a term which the parties
    would say, if questioned, that they had obviously assumed”: <i>Canadian Pacific
    Hotels</i>, at 775.  Based on the
    presumed intention of the parties, the court concluded that persons tendering
    in response to the tender specifications assumed only compliant tenders would
    be accepted and implied that term.  In
    determining the intention of the parties, the court considered the express
    terms of the contract to see whether the suggested implication was necessary, fit
    in with what had been agreed upon and the precise nature of what had been
    implied. </p>

    of the parties was that Industry Canada would facilitate cooperation between

    on a national basis.  The trial judge
    found in effect that the actions of Industry Canada undermined the reasonable expectations
    of the parties in five specific ways and did not fit with what they had agreed
    upon.  The trial judge used the term
    breach of good faith to globally encompass his conclusion that Industry Canada
    had acted in such a way as to undermine the very objectives of the

    68 O.R. (3d) 457 (C.A.), O’Connor A.C.J.O. for the majority at para. 53 and
    Laskin J.A. in dissent at para. 87 held respectively that this court and other
    courts have used the doctrine of good faith to ensure that the parties do not
    act in such a way as to defeat the objectives of the agreement or to police the
    bargain the parties have already made.<a
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[3]</span></a>  In his recent book, <i>The Law of Contracts </i>(Toronto:
    Irwin Law, 2005) at 784-805, Professor McCamus examines a number of Canadian
    cases in which good faith has been found to be an implied term of the contract
    and groups them into three categories: (a) those imposing a duty to cooperate
    in achieving the objectives of the agreement; (b) those imposing limits on the
    exercise of discretionary powers provided for in the contract; and (c) those
    precluding parties from acting to evade contractual duties, such as by engaging
    in conduct not strictly prohibited by the letter of the terms of their
    agreement but that has the effect of defeating rights under the agreement.  In his opinion, the result in each case
    could have been, and was, explicitly grounded in the application of traditional
    contract doctrine.  In the event that a
    generalized duty of good faith is adopted as part of the Canadian common law of
    contracts, he suggests that the duty might be defined in terms of these three
    categories, although he acknowledges such a definition is more restrictive than
    the general duty found in the American Uniform Commercial Code.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to breaching the necessity of cooperation and
    undermining the very objectives of the contract, Industry Canada’s conduct
    would also appear to be an abuse of its discretion under the contract.  In oral argument before us, the Crown
    conceded that Industry Canada’s duty to use its “best efforts” to assist
    CivicLife in the commercialization of the portal involved the exercise of a
    discretion that had to be exercised reasonably and fairly.  That concession is well founded.  In <i>Greenberg v. Meffert</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    a real estate company had an agreement with its real estate agent that, after
    termination of their relationship, payment of commission was payable “at the
    sole discretion” of the company.  This
    court held that these words meant the company must act reasonably in exercising
    its discretion, and also honestly and in good faith.  Since the company had not done so, the agent was entitled to his
    commission.  Additionally, in <i>Shelanu
    Inc. v. Print Three Franchising Corp. </i>(2003), 64 O.R. (3d) 533 at para. 96
    (C.A.), this court affirmed that a discretion under a contract must be
    exercised reasonably, fairly and with regard to how the other party’s interests
    are affected.  See also F. Paul Morrison
    and Hovsep Afarian, “Good Faith in Contracts: A Continuing Evolution” in The
    Honourable Justice Todd Archibald &amp; Michael Cochrane, eds., <i>Annual
    Review of Civil Litigation, 2003 </i>(Toronto: Carswell, 2004) 197 at 213-223;

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, Industry Canada’s conduct appears to come within each of
    the three categories that courts have recognized as giving rise to the
    imposition of a duty of good faith.  For
    the purposes of this appeal it is unnecessary for me to enter into the debate
    as to whether Industry Canada’s misconduct should be characterized as a breach
    of the duty of good faith, as an abuse of the exercise of discretion or simply
    as undermining the reasonable expectations of the parties to the agreement.  The trial judge was entitled to find, as he
    did, that Industry Canada’s conduct breached its contractual obligations to
    CivicLife.  I will deal more fully with
    the Crown’s submissions concerning the trial judge’s finding that Industry
    Canada was required to adequately test the portal below. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before leaving this point I wish to mention that in oral
    argument the Crown submitted that the presence of  “entire agreement” clauses in the supply and I.P. agreements
    between CivicLife and Industry Canada precluded the trial judge from holding
    that Industry Canada breached its contract with CivicLife because nowhere did
    the agreements say that there was a duty of good faith or a duty to exercise a
    discretion reasonably and fairly.  There
    are several responses to this submission.  The first is that an entire agreement clause will not preclude the
    implication of a term of the contract, such as a duty of good faith performance
    or the duty not to abuse a discretion, because such a term is already part of
    the existing agreement.  The trial judge
    was not adding a term to the agreement that was not part of the parties’
    bargain; he was enforcing the reasonable expectations of the parties under the
    agreement.  Second, neither of the
    entire agreement clauses here says that their agreement contains no implied
    terms. Indeed, it would be difficult to set out every aspect of the
    expectations of the parties to a contract.  The wording of the entire agreement clauses does not preclude the implication
    of a term.  Third, an agreement in
    writing may be varied by a subsequent oral agreement.  Here, at the July 2000 meeting the parties orally agreed to vary
    their written arrangement and adopt a “minimal integration approach”.  The entire agreement clause does not affect
    the reasonable expectations of the parties with respect to that oral agreement.
    Fourth, based on the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <i>Guarantee Co. of
    North America v. Gordon Capital Corp., </i>[1999] 3 S.C.R. 423, even if the
    entire agreement clause did cover the conduct at issue here, the court has a
    discretion to refuse to enforce it where to do so would be unconscionable,
    unfair, unreasonable or otherwise contrary to public policy: <i>Shelanu, supra,</i> at<i> </i>paras. 30-35.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons given above, the trial judge did not err in
    holding Industry Canada liable to pay CivicLife damages for breach of contract.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(3)       Did the trial judge err in finding that
    Industry Canada was obligated to finance twelve pilot tests of CivicLife’s
    portal software?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the event this court found that Industry Canada
    breached its contract with CivicLife, the Crown did not appeal the amount of
    damages awarded for wasted expenditures ($1.52 million).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the trial judge also found that Industry
    Canada breached its contractual obligation to properly pilot test CivicLife’s
    portal software in twelve different communities.  Because CivicLife’s portal was only tested in two communities,
    the trial judge awarded CivicLife $1 million in damages, based on CivicLife’s
    estimated financial return of $100,000 per pilot.  The Crown challenges this finding of fact as well as the trial
    judge’s calculation of damages in this regard.  The Crown submits that the agreement provided that CivicLife would be
    paid $1.52 million for the delivery of the portal software and that testing of
    the portal in twelve different communities was not part of the contract. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the issue of
    whether testing of the portal in twelve different communities was part of the contract, in addition to the
    provisions of the parties’ agreements mentioned already in these reasons, the
    following additional provisions from the supply agreement between Industry
    Canada and CivicLife are relevant:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>4. Context and Scope</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>IC [Industry Canada] is in the process of
    developing and rolling out a national ACCESS.CA service to be launched in
    December 2000.  In preparation for the
    national launch, IC requires a functioning portal to be available by the
    Completion Date for technical verification and immediately thereafter for up to
    20 Pilot Trials in communities across Canada.  Pilot Trials would be operational until launch of the national service
    at the end of 2000.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Annex A contains a list of communities that are
    candidates for Pilot Trials.  Other
    communities may be added to this list.  IC will determine the list of Pilot Trial communities and the priority
    sequence for Pilot Trials.  [Annex A
    states in part, “Pilots will be implemented according to a schedule to be
    established by IC, and will continue until the national launch of ACCESS.CA
    service.”  There then follows a list of
    48 communities.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>CivicLife, in partnership with SmartSources, will
    develop and supply Civic Portal software with the capabilities set out in
    Section 7 Deliverables, that will be capable of being scaled to provide service
    in all of the Pilot Trial communities.  The software shall be further scalable for national launch and
    growth.  CivicLife and SmartSources will
    also provide the design and other specifications and requirements for the
    server hardware and software necessary to host the Civic Portal software in a
    sufficient scale to provide simultaneous access in the Pilot Trial communities,
    and subsequently for national launch and growth.  These specifications will be provided in document form within 10
    working days of receipt of the final list of pilot trial communities and
    concurrent user estimates from IC.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The contracted cost of the work up to the
    Completion Date is $1.52 M (Canadian Funds).  Decisions regarding specific approach for launch and further
    expenditures will be dependent on the performance of CivicLife and
    SmartSources, and other planning considerations.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>6.2 Schedule Elements</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>After the Completion Date, CivicLife and
    SmartSources will provide support as defined in Section 7.10 Operational and
    Technical Support to Industry Canada for a period of 1 year. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge awarded damages for ten pilot tests
    that did not occur on the basis of the principle that a plaintiff is entitled
    to recover losses that directly and naturally result in the ordinary course of
    events from the breach of contract.  As
    can be seen, s.&nbsp;4 of the supply agreement between Industry Canada and
    CivicLife contemplates the requirement for a substantial number of pilots (up
    to twenty) in order to adequately test the CivicLife portal.  The trial judge rejected the Crown’s
    argument that the purpose of the pilots was to test the portal concept as
    opposed to the functionality of the CivicLife portal. No palpable and
    overriding error has been shown respecting this finding. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> While the Crown
    relies on the wording of the supply agreement, which makes decisions about the
    specific approach for the national rollout and further expenditures contingent
    on “the performance of CivicLife and SmartSources, and other planning
    considerations”, it led no evidence indicating that (a)&nbsp;Industry Canada
    ever rejected or found fault in any of the products supplied by CivicLife, or
    (b)&nbsp;that planning considerations prevented testing of the portal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The uncontradicted evidence of Mr. Higgins, whom the
    trial judge found to be credible, was that he left the company where he was
    employed, incorporated CivicLife and pursued negotiations until a deal was
    reached in the expectation that the portal would be properly tested and rolled out
    nationally. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Throughout, the parties governed themselves in the expectation
    there would be a number of pilots.  The
    pilot testing that actually took place was watered down because it only
    occurred on two occasions, and because the communities in which it was tested,
    Lanark County and Ste. Hyacinthe, Quebec, did not give any national
    exposure.  In addition, CivicLife’s
    portal was tested along with SmartSources’ competing portal, and Industry
    Canada was in clear breach of the agreement.  In order to determine if the portal was worth rolling out nationally it
    had to be tested nationally and the government study of proposed sites
    supported the proposition that at least one pilot site per province was
    required to establish the portal’s efficacy.  Moreover, CivicLife purchased enough software licenses to support twenty
    pilots.  The trial judge’s finding that
    damages should be awarded for Industry Canada’s failure to conduct ten more
    pilots, one in each province and an additional one in Ontario and Quebec, is therefore
    supportable on the evidence.  A
    foreseeable consequence of Industry Canada’s breach of contract with CivicLife
    was that pilot testing would be affected.  Accordingly, the trial judge did not err in awarding damages for
    Industry Canada’s failure to adequately test CivicLife’s portal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In fixing the amount
    of the award at $1 million, the trial judge found that CivicLife would have
    been retained to proceed with all the pilots.  The trial judge accepted the evidence of Mr. Awrey that each of the pilots
    had a value of $100,000, a figure the trial judge found to be “very
    reasonable.”  The Crown says that Mr.
    Higgins, who also testified for CivicLife, indicated that CivicLife could have
    reasonably expected  $100,000 of revenue
    (as opposed to profit) per pilot.  The
    trial judge, however, relied on Mr.&nbsp;Awrey’s estimate of what each pilot
    was worth to CivicLife (which was not challenged by the Crown), and he knew
    that CivicLife had been paid $390,000 for two pilot tests in small
    communities.  Accordingly, it was open
    to the trial judge to come to the conclusion he did.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(4)       Did the trial judge err in awarding punitive damages to
    CivicLife?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unlike the situation when a court is reviewing
    compensatory damages, when dealing with punitive damages courts have a much greater
    scope and discretion on appeal: <i>Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto, </i>[1995]
    2 S.C.R. 1130 at para. 197.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the trial judge recognized, punitive damages will
    rarely be awarded in a case involving breach of contract.  In fact, they can only be recovered if the
    plaintiff can establish a separate actionable wrong – <i>i.e.</i> the breach of
    a different obligation under the contract or other duty, such as a fiduciary
    obligation.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span>[4]</span></span></a>  This is because in contract cases, the
    remedies open to the plaintiff are only those that arise from the contractual
    relationship, whereas in tort cases the injured party is entitled to be made
    whole:  see <i>Vorvis v. Insurance Corp.
    of British Columbia</i>,<i> </i>[1989] 1 S.C.R. 1085 at 1106&#8209;1107.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CivicLife
    relies on the decision of the Supreme Court in <i>Whiten v. Pilot Insurance Co</i>.,
    [2002] 1 S.C.R. 595, in support of its position that a breach of the
    contractual duty of good faith can justify an award of punitive damages.  In that case, Binnie J. held at
    para.&nbsp;79:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the case at bar, Pilot acknowledges that an
    insurer is under a duty of good faith and fair dealing.  Pilot says that this is a contractual
    duty.  <i>Vorvis, </i>it says, requires
    a tort.  However, in my view, a breach
    of the contractual duty of good faith is independent of and in addition to the
    breach of contractual duty to pay the loss.  It constitutes an “actionable wrong” within the <i>Vorvis </i>rule,
    which does not require an independent tort.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The problem is that in this case, unlike in <i>Whiten,
    supra</i>, the breach of the duty of good faith is the basis for the trial
    judge’s award of compensatory damages.  In awarding these damages, the trial judge’s description of Industry
    Canada’s conduct is strikingly similar to his description of the conduct grounding
    his award of punitive damages.  For example,
    in dealing with compensatory damages, the trial judge held that Industry Canada
    breached its duty of good faith to CivicLife in that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    defendant [Industry Canada] failed to immediately notify the plaintiff
    [CivicLife] that it contemplated not proceeding with the national launch and
    instead communicated with the plaintiff in such a way as to indicate to the
    plaintiff the project was proceeding as planned.</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>In describing Industry Canada’s conduct that merited punitive damages,
    the trial judge stated:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>When
    the project was faltering, the defendant [Industry Canada], knowing that the
    plaintiff was in dire financial straits and needed to be told the truth as soon
    as possible, deliberately chose not to respond to the plaintiff’s many letters
    and in fact deliberately kept silent to allow the plaintiff to drown in useless
    and expensive attempts to keep the project alive.</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The gravamen of Industry Canada’s conduct in each case is its silence
    and its encouragement of CivicLife all the while acting as<b> </b>it did with
    SmartSources. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover, when reviewing an award of punitive damages,
    the question the reviewing court must ask both with respect to entitlement as
    well as quantum is whether punitive damages serve a rational purpose: <i>Hill</i>,<i> supra</i>, at para. 197; <i>Whiten</i>, <i>supra</i>,<i> </i>at para. 101. That
    rational purpose is achieved when punitive damages are required to deter the
    conduct in issue and to denounce it: <i>Hill</i>,<i> </i>at para. 197; <i>Whiten</i>,
    at para. 103. Two of the factors the court is to consider in deciding whether
    an award of punitive damages is rational are the relative vulnerability of the
    plaintiff and any advantage or profit gained by the defendant.  However, t<span lang=EN-US>he wisdom of CivicLife’s business plan in choosing to put most of its
    “eggs in one basket” by entering into the portal contracts cannot be laid at
    the feet of Industry Canada.  CivicLife’s vulnerability was largely self-imposed.  Moreover, </span>there is no evidence that
    Mr.&nbsp;Casselman’s misconduct (<i>i.e.</i> his secret and deliberate
    encouragement of SmartSources to provide its own portal) was part of the
    general culture at Industry Canada, or that Industry Canada profited from the
    misconduct as in <i>Whiten</i>, <i>supra.</i>  To punish Industry Canada and, ultimately, the Canadian taxpayer for the
    actions of a rogue employee over a relatively short time frame would not serve
    a rational purpose in such a case as this where substantial compensatory
    damages have already been awarded.  Furthermore, I do not think an award of punitive damages is necessary to
    deter such conduct in the future.  Accordingly,
    I would allow the appeal with respect to punitive damages and set aside the
    award of punitive damages.</p>

    paragraphs 71 and 72 of his reasons the trial judge held:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[71]
    The second claim [for damages] arises out of loss of three types of
    opportunities related to the contract, namely:</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span
lang=EN-US>(a) Pilot
    and Post Pilot Enhancement</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[72]
    The last two (2), items (b) and (c), can only arise if the defendant [Industry
    Canada] had a legal obligation to proceed with the national rollout.  As I have found this not to be the case, no
    damages can be awarded for these two heads of damages. The same applies to post
    pilot enhancements which would have been carried out only in final preparation
    for the national rollout.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>In accordance

lang=EN-US>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before us, CivicLife<span lang=EN-US> accepted the trial judge’s finding of fact that Industry Canada had no
    obligation to proceed with a national rollout of the portal.  CivicLife submits, however, that the trial
    judge did not correctly apply the law of damages to the facts. Had he done so,
    CivicLife submits it ought to have been awarded damages for loss of value and
    opportunity because a national rollout did not take place as well as because
    the community program did not proceed.  CivicLife submits that the measure of the damages for the lost value of
    the company is the diminution in market value of the company.  On December 31, 2000, CivicLife’s Class A
    Preferred Shares issued for cash were approximately 5</span>&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent<span
lang=EN-US> of the total shares issued and
    outstanding.  Based on this percentage
    and the amount of third party investments ($712,612), CivicLife submits that
    its implied valuation equaled $14,520,000.  CivicLife also submits that it is entitled to an additional award of $4
    million in order to compensate it for lost opportunities it claims would have reasonably
    flowed from the national rollout.  Specifically, CivicLife estimated it would have received $2 million for
    the technical support that would have been a necessary part of the national
    rollout of Access.ca and a further $2 million in income for software
    enhancements and community technical support also associated with a national
    rollout as well as for sales of the portal outside Canada.</span></p>

    trial judge properly found that CivicLife assumed the risk that a national
    launch of Access.ca might not occur.  There is no objective evidence concerning CivicLife’s chances of success
    as a newcomer in a competitive portal market.  Nor is there any such evidence that, because of Industry Canada’s
    actions, CivicLife lost the opportunity to make sales of its portal outside of
    Canada. In <i>Ticketnet Corp. v. Air Canada</i>, [1993] O.J. No. 289 (Gen.
    Div.), appeal allowed in part<i> </i>[1997] O.J. No. 4638 (C.A.), a decision on
    which CivicLife relies, the trial judge found that there was a window of
    opportunity in which the plaintiff’s product would be accepted in the marketplace
    and that Air Canada actively prevented Ticketnet from selling its virtually
    completed software.  Here, the trial
    judge did not make any such finding.  Nor did he find that Industry Canada’s actions caused the demise of
    CivicLife or that the likelihood of CivicLife’s collapse in the event no

    Higgins, one of the principals of CivicLife, admitted that in January 2001
    there was a “crack in the market” that caused potential investors in CivicLife
    to retrench.  The result was that these
    “dot-com” companies became inward-looking and conservative and investment
    activities stopped at such large companies as Sun Microsystems as well as at
    other companies involved in the internet economy.  No evidence was led concerning the effect of this collapse in the
    market on the value of CivicLife or on the likelihood of its ability to make
    sales of its portal outside of Canada.</span></p>

    event, diminution in the value of CivicLife would not even be the appropriate
    measure of damages if CivicLife was deserving of compensation for the fact that
    the national rollout did not occur and the community program did not proceed.  The appropriate measure of damages would be
    the value of the lost opportunity to receive income from future sales and
    technical support that would have reasonably flowed from the national
    rollout.  However, CivicLife’s evidence
    in this regard falls well short of the evidence required to sustain an award
    for lost opportunity where the loss in question is incapable of exact
    proof.  </span></p>

  <p>This Agreement is related to the following separate
    agreements, all of which taken together are part of a complete whole.  The Agreement’s requirements must be
    complied with in concert with the requirements of all these agreements[.]  [The I.P. agreements between Industry Canada
    and CivicLife and Industry Canada and SmartSources, the supply agreement
    between Industry Canada and SmartSources and the development and commercial
    agreement between SmartSources and CivicLife are then listed.]</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText3>. . .</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>4.            Context and Scope</span></h4>
  <p>IC [Industry Canada] is in the process of developing and
    rolling out a national ACCESS.CA service to be launched in December 2000.  In preparation for the national launch, IC
    requires a functioning portal<a href="#_ftn5"
name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[5]</span></a> to be available by the Completion Date for technical verification and
    immediately thereafter for up to 20 Pilot Trials in communities across
    Canada.  Pilot Trials would be
    operational until launch of the national service at the end of 2000.  </p>
  <p>Annex A contains a list of communities that are candidates for
    Pilot Trials.  Other communities may be
    added to this list.  IC will determine
    the list of Pilot Trial communities and the priority sequence for Pilot
    Trials.  [Annex A states in part,
    “Pilots will be implemented according to a schedule to be established by IC,
    and will continue until the national launch of ACCESS.CA service.”  There then follows a list of 48
    communities.]</p>
  <p>CivicLife, in partnership with SmartSources, will develop and
    supply Civic Portal software with the capabilities set out in Section 7
    Deliverables, that will be capable of being scaled to provide service in all of
    the Pilot Trial communities.  The
    software shall be further scalable for national launch and growth.  CivicLife and SmartSources will also provide
    the design and other specifications and requirements for the server hardware
    and software necessary to host the Civic Portal software in a sufficient scale
    to provide simultaneous access in the Pilot Trial communities, and subsequently
    for national launch and growth.  These
    specifications will be provided in document form within 10 working days of
    receipt of the final list of pilot trial communities and concurrent user estimates
    from IC.  </p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText3>. . .</p>
  <p>The contracted cost of the work up to the Completion Date is
    $1.52 M (Canadian Funds).  Decisions
    regarding specific approach for launch and further expenditures will be
    dependent on the performance of CivicLife and SmartSources, and other planning
    considerations.</p>
