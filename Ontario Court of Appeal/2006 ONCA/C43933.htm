    </span> Maxwell Aero Maintenance Ltd. (&#8220;Maxwell&#8221;) appeals the motion judge&#8217;s 
    dismissal of its claim for a lien for storage and repair of a 1983 Dassault 
    Falcon 200 Aircraft (the &#8220;aircraft&#8221;).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Although 
    Maxwell&#8217;s negligence resulted in damage to the aircraft that exceeded the 
    repair and storage charges giving rise to its lien, Maxwell asserts that it 
    has the right to be paid because Provident Bank (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;), the lender who 
    took possession of the aircraft, was insured for the damage Maxwell caused.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Maxwell asserts that the motion judge erred in setting off its charges 
    against the cost to repair the aircraft due to its negligence without regard 
    to the insurance proceeds the Bank received.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     
    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Maxwell alleges that it had an oral agreement with the bailor of the 
    aircraft, Chell.com/Air, Inc. (&#8220;Chell&#8221;) that Chell would obtain insurance 
    covering any loss or damage to the aircraft while it was in Maxwell&#8217;s possession. 
    Maxwell asserts that set-off does not apply because the alleged oral agreement 
    precludes any claim for loss or damage to the aircraft while in its possession.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Rather, the Bank must look to the insurance proceeds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   
    </span>Maxwell further contends that its rights are not affected by the fact 
    that it is claiming against the Bank as opposed to Chell because the Bank&#8217;s 
    claim can be no higher than Chell&#8217;s. Irrespective of whether an agreement 
    exists, Maxwell also argues that it is entitled to be paid because otherwise 
    the Bank will receive double recovery. Consequently, Maxwell submits that 
    the motion judge erred in dismissing its lien claim. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></h4>

'> [3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The facts are as follows.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As 
    of January 26, 2000, the aircraft was owned by Chell. Pursuant to a trust 
    agreement dated January 26, 2000, Chell transferred title to the aircraft 
    to First Security Bank, National Association (&#8220;First Security&#8221;).<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'> [1] </span></span></a><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The same day, Chell entered into an Aircraft 
    Operating Agreement (&#8220;AOA&#8221;) with First Security whereby it obtained a licence 
    to possess, use and operate the aircraft.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>One of the terms of the AOA was that Chell was required to maintain 
    at all times comprehensive aircraft and general liability insurance &#8220;in such 
    amount and type usually carried by corporations similarly situated with [Chell] 
    and owning and operating similar aircraft, and covering such other risks as 
    are customarily insured against by such corporations.&#8221; The AOA also directed 
    that all insurance policies name both First Security and Chell as insureds 
    or loss payees. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> First Security then borrowed $7,000,000 USD from the Bank. In addition 
    to executing a promissory note for the amount of the loan plus interest thereon, 
    Chell and First Security provided the Bank with a first priority security 
    interest in the aircraft by entering into an Aircraft Mortgage and Security 
    Agreement (&#8220;AMSA&#8221;) with the Bank dated February 4, 2000.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>The AMSA stated that in the event of loss Chell and First Security 
    would pay the Bank the outstanding principal balance of the loan together 
    with accrued but unpaid interest thereon. The AMSA also required Chell and 
    First Security to insure the aircraft against loss or damage. All policies 
    were to be made payable to the Bank as the loss payee so long as the loan 
    was outstanding and any payments made were to reduce the amount to be paid 
    by First Security on the loan.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The Bank perfected its security interest by making the required 
    filings both in the United States and Ontario. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> It appears from the evidence that Mark Valentine, an investment banker 
    and representative of Chell, and his wife also gave their personal guarantees 
    of the loan. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The insurance policy in place at the time of the loss identified Thompson 
    Kernaghan, the now-bankrupt investment firm for whom Mark Valentine worked,

    </span> The motion judge dealt with the issues of double recovery and equitable

    of equitable set-off in <i>Telford v. Holt </i>(1990), 69 D.L.R. (4th) 25 
    at 46 (S.C.C.). These principles are as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.<span

    </span> A cross-claim must be so clearly connected with the demand of the

    </span> The motion judge held that even though the Bank/LINC had been paid 
    insurance proceeds for the loss of the aircraft&#8217;s tail cones, it was nonetheless 
    entitled to an equitable set-off of the cost to replace the missing parts 
    from the amount owing under Maxwell&#8217;s lien. In concluding that equitable set-off 
    was appropriate, the motion judge applied the common law principle in <i

    25 at 46 (S.C.C.).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This principle 
    is to the effect that people are entitled to insure themselves against a loss 
    and the wrongdoer may not take the benefit of the innocent party&#8217;s prudence 
    in so doing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">    </span>Whether, as here, the 
    insurer has a right of subrogation, and whether the insurer&#8217;s right of subrogation

    (4th) 1 at 21 (S.C.C.). In addition, the motion judge commented: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It should also be noted that in the Aircraft Mortgage 
    and Security Agreement between First Security and Chell and the Bank, Article 
    20.2 sets out what happens under the heading &#8220;Insurance Against Loss or Damage 
    to the Aircraft&#8221; and in Article 20.3, &#8220;Application of Proceeds in any Event 
    of Loss&#8221;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The payments go to reduce

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am of the view that the cases put forward by Maxwell

    </span> Before us, the appellant vigorously argued that the alleged agreement 
    between Chell and Maxwell as to insurance affected the Bank/LINC&#8217;s right to 
    set off the cost of replacing the lost aircraft parts against Maxwell&#8217;s lien 
    claim and that the motion judge erred by disregarding the effect of the agreement. 
    Maxwell argues that the legal effect of this agreement is that Chell is precluded 
    from making a claim against Maxwell for the missing parts and that the Bank 
    can have no higher rights than Chell in this regard. I accept that the Bank 
    can have no higher rights than Chell.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> There is some evidence of an oral agreement between Chell&#8217;s pilot 
    and Maxwell that it would carry insurance to cover any loss or damage to the 
    aircraft while it was in Maxwell&#8217;s possession. The authority of the pilot 
    to enter into such an agreement on behalf of Chell is not apparent from the 
    record.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Quite apart from the absence 
    of evidence as to the pilot&#8217;s authority to bind Chell, there is no evidence 
    that Chell agreed to waive any claim against Maxwell for any loss or damage

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The authorities on which the appellant relies are all cases in which 
    a party agrees to insure itself against the negligence of another that could 
    affect it and in which the court holds that the party who obtains the insurance, 
    as well as any subrogated insurer, actually or impliedly grants a waiver against 
    making a claim in negligence against the wrongdoer. The purpose of obtaining 
    the insurance in those cases is to protect the wrongdoer by providing payment 
    to the person placing the insurance. Otherwise, there would be no reason to 
    obtain the insurance and the insurance would lack &#8220;substance.&#8221; Where the only 
    purpose of obtaining insurance is to protect the wrongdoer, the court will 
    imply a waiver of any claim in negligence on the basis that the insurance 
    otherwise lacks &#8220;substance.&#8221;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Here, the purpose of obtaining the insurance was not to protect Maxwell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   
    </span>The reasons for my conclusion are as follows. First, the insurance 
    on the aircraft existed prior to the bailment of the aircraft to Maxwell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Further, the AMSA directed that any insurance payments go to reduce 
    the borrower&#8217;s debt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Second, based 
    on the agreements with its lenders, Chell had a reason to insure the aircraft 
    apart from the possibility of Maxwell&#8217;s negligence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Thus, the insurance had &#8220;subject matter&#8221; apart from Maxwell&#8217;s negligence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Waiver of any right to sue cannot be implied and, as I have indicated, 
    there is no evidence Chell expressly waived its right to sue Maxwell.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> I will explain further. In support of its position that Chell agreed 
    with Maxwell to obtain insurance, Maxwell relies on the supplementary affidavit 
    of Glen Maxwell, representative of the appellant Maxwell. This affidavit states 
    in paragraph 5:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Now shown to me and marked as Exhibit G to this 
    my Affidavit is a true copy of a letter dated October 29, 2003 from the solicitor 
    for Maxwell to the solicitor for the Applicant confirming that the agreement 
    between Maxwell and the owner of the aircraft was that the owner of the aircraft 
    would place all necessary insurance on the aircraft, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>and 
    therefore no claim can be made as against Maxwell for any loss of parts belonging 
    to the aircraft</i> [emphasis added].<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The emphasized portion of this excerpt from Glen Maxwell&#8217;s affidavit 
    is a legal argument and not a statement of fact. In fact, it appears to be 
    drawn from the above-referenced letter written by Maxwell&#8217;s solicitor, in 
    which he states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>With respect to the issue of the loss of the cones

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I attach a copy of some of the emails that confirm 
    this. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Therefore no claim can be made by your client as

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Bow Helicopter Ltd. v. Bell Helicopter Textron 
    et al.</i> (1981), 125 D.L.R. (3d) 386, mentioned in the letter, is inapplicable 
    to the case at bar. In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Bow Helicopters</i>, 
    the lessee of a helicopter agreed with the lessor to provide insurance against 
    loss or damage to the helicopter and to obtain a waiver of subrogation in 
    favour of the lessor. The helicopter sustained damage in an accident, which 
    the parties agreed was caused by a cause insured against under the insuring 
    agreement. It was agreed that the lessee should repair the helicopter. In 
    due course, the repairs were made and the insurer paid the repair bill. To 
    recover the money expended on that account, the insurer purported to exercise 
    its right of subrogation by causing an action to be commenced in the lessee&#8217;s 
    name against the lessor, who was also the manufacturer of the helicopter, 
    on the basis of negligent manufacture. The Alberta Court of Appeal determined 
    that the covenant by the lessee to insure was for the protection and benefit 
    of the lessor, and had the parties intended to exclude the case of liability 
    for negligent manufacture, express words to that effect would have been required. 
    Accordingly, the court concluded that the lessee and its insurer, who stood 
    in its shoes, were precluded from making a claim against the lessor. </p>

    Blue Sparrow knew he did not carry cargo insurance and that he would not have 
    agreed to carry the goods had he not been assured by a representative of Blue 
    Sparrow that no claim would be made against him, since Blue Sparrow would

    but also deprived the insurer of the right of subrogation to which it was 
    entitled. As a result, Maryland succeeded in obtaining judgment against Blue 
    Sparrow for the amount it had paid out to it. The appeal to this court, reported

    supra, </i>and <i>Blue Sparrow, supra, </i>there is no evidence that Chell 
    actually promised not to sue Maxwell for its negligence or to obtain a waiver 
    of subrogation; nor is there any evidence that such a promise was required 
    by Maxwell as a condition of its agreement to repair and store the aircraft.

    the tenant. The respective amounts of loss to the two buildings were agreed 
    upon at $110,400 and $35,000, and the insurers paid these amounts to the two

    </span> This brings me to Maxwell&#8217;s alternative argument that, irrespective 
    of any agreement as to insurance between Chell and Maxwell, since the Bank 
    has been paid in full by its insurer for any loss caused by Maxwell, Maxwell 
    is entitled to be paid the monies owed to it for repair and storage charges. 
    In rejecting Maxwell&#8217;s argument, the motion judge relied on the common law 
    principle in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ratych v. Bloomer</i>, 
    <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>supra</i>, that people are entitled to insure 
    themselves against a loss and the wrongdoer may not take the benefit of the 
    innocent party&#8217;s prudence in doing so. I agree with the motion judge.<i> </i><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Accordingly, I would hold that the motion judge 
    did not err in her conclusion that the Bank/LINC was entitled to an equitable 
    set-off of the cost to replace the missing aircraft parts from the amount 
    owing under Maxwell&#8217;s lien notwithstanding the fact that the Bank/LINC had 
    been paid insurance proceeds for the loss and in dismissing Maxwell&#8217;s claim 
    for a lien. </p>

    </span> I would dismiss the appeal. I would award the respondent the costs 
    of the appeal fixed in the agreed amount of $7,000 all inclusive. </p>
