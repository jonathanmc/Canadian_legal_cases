    in including in the net family property calculation a portion of the stock

    months after the date of separation.  The second concerns the method used by the trial judge for valuing the

    the 175,000 options issued prior to separation was $424,313.00.  The net after-tax capital gain on the
    245,000 options issued on December 12, 2001 was $652,313.00 of which 8/12,

    receive one half of this profit.  The
    appellant argued that the options had to be valued at the date of separation
    without the benefit of hindsight.  He
    maintained that the respondent was only entitled to one half of the net
    after-tax value of the options actually owned on the date of separation and

    options could be valued using either the intrinsic value method, which measures
    the gain that would be realized if the options were exercised on the date of
    separation, or the Black-Scholes method.  The Black-Scholes method is frequently used in the securities industry
    to value stock options.  <span
lang=EN-US>This method employs a sophisticated
    mathematical formula that takes into account the option price, the option term,
    the market value of the underlying security, the risk-free rate of interest and
    the underlying stock volatility to arrive at an option’s present value.  </span>Using the intrinsic method, the
    expert valued the 175,000 stock options issued prior to the date of separation
    at $5,500.  Using the Black-Scholes
    method, the expert had originally valued these options at $21,100.00.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a>  By the date of trial, the expert had revised
    these figures and was of the view that the value was $49,200.00.  Only the options issued to the appellant
    prior to separation were included in her calculations.  The expert did not value the 245,000 options
    granted on December 12, 2001.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge rejected the expert’s opinion as to the value
    of the options and determined that the fairest way to value the options was to
    use the “if and when” approach.  She
    described the “if and when” approach as one where the court simply divides any
    stock options existing at the time of separation without valuing them and
    considers the owner of the options to be holding half of them in trust for the
    other spouse.  Using this approach, the
    trial judge awarded the respondent one half of the net profit generated by the
    exercise of the pre-separation options as well as the portion of the December

    characterization of  8/12 of the 245,000
    stock options he received from his employer IAMGOLD on December 12, 2001, as
    property subject to net family property equalization.  This, he submits, ignores the fact that the options were not
    awarded to him until three and a half months after separation and, until they
    were awarded, he had no right to these nor did his employer have any obligation
    to grant them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s reasons on this issue are as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>[59] I do not accept the
    wife’s constructive trust claim for one-half of the stock options issued to the
    husband.  The wife is entitled to have
    included in net family property the stock options received or earned by the
    husband by the date of separation.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>[60] Approximately 4 months after separation, 245,000 stock options were
    issued to the husband.  The letter from
    the employer announcing the grant of stock options in December 2001, states
    that the grant reflected the husband’s efforts during the then almost completed
    year.  While both the husband and Larry
    Phillips commented that stock options were issued to the husband to bring him
    into parity with other senior executives when he was promoted to CFO, there was
    no evidence as to what portion of the stock options were for this purpose.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[61] On balance,
    I conclude that the 245,000 stock options were given for work done by the
    husband for the prior year.  As the
    separation occurred after 8 months of 2001, 8/12 of 245,000 stock options
    issued in December, 2001 should be included in net family property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the appellant agrees with the trial judge’s statement
    that stock options “received or earned” by the date of separation ought
    properly to be included in the net family property calculation, he argues that
    the December 12, 2001 stock options had not been earned as they did not exist
    at the date of separation.  The issuing
    of these stock options was discretionary and the options were not earned until
    the Board made the decision to grant them.  Accordingly, the appellant submits that he had no entitlement to these
    options on the date of separation and, as a result, no portion of these options
    should have been included in the net family property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This, he submits, is consistent with section 4(1) of the <i>Family
    Law Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3.  That
    section provides that the value of “any interest, present or future, vested or
    contingent” in personal property “owned” by a spouse on the valuation date is
    to be included in the net family property calculation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to the appellant, the court should treat options in
    the same way as it treats severance packages received by one of the spouses
    after the date of separation.  We were
    referred to this court’s decision in <i>Leckie v. Leckie</i> (2004), 5 R.F.L.
    (6th) 123 (Ont. C.A.) wherein the court explained that where a severance
    package does not exist at the date of separation, neither party had any
    entitlement to such a package at the date of valuation.  Accordingly, the severance package and, by
    analogy, the December 12, 2001 options are not property as defined in the <i>Family
    Law Act</i> and cannot be “owned” by the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the present case can be distinguished from <i>Leckie</i>.  Stock options granted as part of a
    remuneration package are different from severance packages.  Severance packages are tied to a specific
    event, the employee’s termination.  Where the offer of a severance package and the termination of the
    employee do not occur until after the date of separation, the employee has no
    right or entitlement to the severance package at the date of separation.  Although the size of the severance package
    is often related to the length of service of the employee, it is the
    termination of the employment that creates the entitlement, and the length of
    prior service is used to determine the length of the notice period or pay in
    lieu of notice appropriate for that employee.  In other words, the severance package is directed at compensating for
    the loss of employment and is not intended as pay for past service.</p>

line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To me stock options are more properly considered to be an
    employment related benefit and should be treated as such.  Accordingly, stock options awarded to a
    spouse by his or her employer after the valuation date ought to be included in
    the spouse’s net family property if, on the valuation date, the spouse had
    earned the right to the options.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A useful analogy is a wrongfully terminated employee’s
    entitlement to claim a bonus, profit sharing, stock option or similar form of
    remuneration which would have been earned but for the wrongful termination.  In the employment context, Osborne J. in <i>Thomson
    v. Bechtel Canada Ltd</i>. (1983), 3 C.C.E.L. 16 at 21 (Ont. H.C.J.), aff’d
    (1985), 6 C.C.E.L. xxxv (Ont. C.A.) observed:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[A] benefit
    beyond salary should be included as part of the employee’s remuneration package
    if the employee has established an entitlement to the benefit.  Discretionary benefits are not always to be
    excluded.  The substance of the
    arrangement between employer and employee must be determined.  The form of the arrangement is often helpful
    in that determination.  It is not always
    conclusive of the substance of a particular arrangement.  It is necessary to consider whether the
    bonus or claimed profit-sharing entitlement is an integral part of the
    plaintiff’s salary or remuneration package.  Were bonus and performance so closely related so as to lead to the
    conclusion that the defendant has received performance in circumstances that
    would have attracted payment of bonus or perhaps profit-sharing, had the
    plaintiff not been fired?  All of the
    circumstances of the profit-sharing and bonus arrangements have to be
    considered.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It therefore must be determined whether, as at the date of
    separation, the appellant was entitled as of right to the benefit or whether
    the benefit was <i>ex gratia</i>.  The
    answer to this question will depend on the evidence and, specifically, how the
    benefit arrangements are structured.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Corporate counsel for the appellant’s employer testified that
    “[e]ach year come November there would be a compensation review for the past
    year, and that would include the issue of whether to grant options.  So everyone was dealt with as a group on an
    annual basis.”  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although there was evidence that the granting of options was
    discretionary, the evidence also disclosed a relatively consistent history of
    issuing stock options to the appellant.  Prior to receiving the December 2001 options, he had received stock
    options in March 1996, December 1996, December 1997, February 2000 and December
    2000.  Past conduct can be such that
    what started as a discretionary benefit becomes an integral part of an
    employee’s compensation package (see <i>Turner v. Canadian Admiral Corp.</i> (1980), 1 C.C.E.L. 130 (Ont. H.C.J.) and <i>Sandelson v. International Vintners
    Ltd.</i> (1987), 18 B.C.L.R. (2d) 86 (S.C.)).</p>

    included in net family property stock options “received or earned” by the
    appellant by the date of separation, the trial judge then referred to evidence
    led at trial that clearly linked the grant of the December 2001 options to the
    appellant’s efforts during the almost completed year.  She also noted that other evidence suggested that these options
    were issued to the appellant because of his January 2000 promotion to CFO so as
    to bring him into parity with other senior executives.  There was, therefore, an evidentiary basis
    for the judge’s finding that a substantial portion of the 245,000 stock options
    issued in December 2001 related to work carried out by the appellant prior to
    the date of separation.  This finding is
    entitled to deference as a factual finding and ought not to be disturbed. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the trial judge did not put it this way, I interpret
    her finding and her inclusion of a portion of the December 2001 options in net
    family property as meaning that, as at the date of separation, the appellant
    had earned 8/12 of the as yet unissued stock options and that, on a balance of
    probabilities, was entitled as of right to that benefit on the date of
    separation.  In other words he was,
    within the meaning of s. 4(1) of the <i>Family Law Act</i>, the owner of
    property which consisted of a right to receive or an interest in these earned
    stock options.  In my view, this finding
    was available to her on the evidence and, in the circumstances of this case, it
    is the interpretation that best achieves the <i>Family Law Act</i>’s primary

    (Ont. S.C.J.).  Under this approach, a
    court considers the owner of the asset to be holding one half of the asset in

    the asset is sold, the owner would be required to pay the other spouse one half
    of the gain.  By the date of trial, the
    appellant had already exercised all of his options.  Therefore, the trial judge simply included the net gain realized
    by the appellant on these options in the net family property calculation.  As set out earlier, the net gain on the

    that the court determine the value of the property on the valuation date.  In the present case, both parties agree that

    related to the second component of the expert’s evidence, being the adjustments
    made to the figure generated by the Black-Scholes method.  This rejection of the second component of
    the expert’s evidence is entitled to deference in this court.  I do not understand the trial judge to have
    rejected the assumptions used by the expert to reach the Black-Scholes value of
    $118,447.00 and, on this record, I find no basis for doing so.  Rather, the trial judge’s concerns seem to

    not appropriate to value options that are not publicly traded.  Immediately following the rejection of the
    expert’s opinion as to the value, the trial judge set out a lengthy discussion
    of the appropriate approach to be taken in valuing employee stock options in a
    family law context.  The trial judge
    referred <i>Reid v. Reid, supra</i>, noting that in that case Snowie J. had
    “rejected the Black Scholes approach on the basis that it was not the
    appropriate method where the stock options were not publicly traded or vested”
    and found “that the ‘if and when’ approach was the most reasonable and the
    fairest way to determine the value of the stock options.”  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then cited the New Brunswick decision of <i>Miller
    v. Miller, supra,</i> and summarized that court’s view as follows: “[T]he Black
    Scholes method is simply a complicated mathematical formula that considers a number
    of market factors.  However the formula
    is limited because it cannot consider limits on the options, such as delayed
    vesting dates or limits on selling the stocks.  As such, the formula needs to be adjusted for such limits.”  The trial judge then concluded that the
    “fairest way to value the options is on an ‘if and when’ basis.  This approach is not dependent on the
    educated guesses of experts, so that the person who holds the options is at
    risk or has the potential for gain.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude from this analysis that the trial judge was aware
    that the Black-Scholes method is, in essence, a mathematical formula and an
    accepted method of valuing options.  She
    also recognized that, in the case of employee options, limits as to the
    marketability and as to vesting are such that the actual value of these options
    is normally less than the value generated by the Black-Scholes method and that
    certain adjustments are normally necessary to account for these
    contingencies.  However, rather than
    taking the Black-Scholes figure generated by the expert and determining what
    adjustments, if any, should be applied to this figure to account for
    contingencies, the trial judge concluded that the “if and when” approach was
    preferable to the Black-Scholes approach because the “if and when” approach
    avoided having the holder of the options bear the risk of loss and the
    potential for gain.  In effect, she
    adopted a method which makes no attempt to provide a valuation date value and
    which enjoys the benefits of hindsight over one which values the options as at
    the valuation date based on information available at that time.  In so doing, the trial judge erred.</p>

    generated by the expert’s Black-Scholes calculation and, having rejected the
    expert’s evidence as to the appropriate adjustments for contingencies,
    determined what adjustments, if any, were appropriate based on the evidence she
    did accept.  As discussed in the balance
    of these reasons, I consider the Black-Scholes method of valuing options to be
    an appropriate valuation approach in cases such as this where the underlying
    stock is publicly traded.  The
    Black-Scholes value can, and normally should be adjusted to account for
    contingencies such as the delay in vesting, limits on exercise and so on.  This is not to say that trial judges cannot
    choose a different approach in appropriate cases nor that the expert’s

    options for which the Black-Scholes valuation method was designed, many
    employee stock options cannot be traded or sold and may be subject to vesting
    conditions.  As I have noted earlier
    this criticism can be addressed, when the underlying shares are publicly

    publicly traded options.  To comply with
    the <i>Family Law Act</i>, parties to matrimonial proceedings and the courts

    trial judge did not accept the expert’s adjustments to the Black-Scholes figure
    for the pre-December 2001 options and considered the magnitude of the proposed
    adjustments to be excessive.  I see no
    basis to interfere with this finding.  Using the expert’s non-discounted Black-Scholes valuation of $118,447.00
    as a starting point to setting the value of the pre-December 2001 options, I
    consider that some adjustment to account for the restrictions on and unvested
    nature of some of the options is nonetheless appropriate.  The reductions suggested by the appellant’s
    expert amounted to almost 60% of the basic Black-Scholes value.  She had assumed that, for unvested options,
    the holder would be risk averse and would purchase a put option to protect
    against the risk of ups and downs.  To
    this reduced figure she applied further discounts to account for the time value
    of money, the risk of forced early exercise and the risk of termination of employment
    or death prior to vesting.  For vested
    options she applied a 50% discount for lack of marketability and transaction
    costs.  It can be inferred from the
    reasons of the trial judge and the record that the trial judge did not consider
    the need for reductions of this magnitude to have been made out, and I
    agree.  Nonetheless, some reduction is
    appropriate to account for transaction costs and the restrictions on and
    unvested nature of some of the options.  In the circumstances, I consider a discount of 20% to the $118,447.00
    figure to be fair.  This reduces the

    form of partnership and, upon the breakdown of the partnership, to provide for
    the equitable settlement of the affairs of the spouses.  Thus, the purpose of the <i>FLA</i> is to
    ensure that the value of all assets acquired by the parties by virtue of the
    marriage are shared equally upon the marriage breakdown.  The key property settlement provisions are
    ss.&nbsp;4 and 5.  Together, they
    provide that the <i>value</i> of all property accumulated during the marriage
    partnership, with some exceptions, as opposed to the property itself, is to be
    shared equally by the spouses on marriage breakdown.  This is accomplished by the equalization process described in
    s.&nbsp;5.  The first step in the
    equalization process is to determine each spouse’s net family property under
    s.&nbsp;4(1) on the valuation date.  The
    second step is the valuation of the net family property as of the valuation
    date.  The third step is equalizing the

    of a constructive trust was permissable to achieve a just and equitable
    division of family property under the <i>FLA</i>.  In concluding that it was, Cory&nbsp;J. undertook an analysis of
    the property provisions of the <i>FLA</i>, in particular ss.&nbsp;4 and 5.  At paras.&nbsp;39 and 40, Cory&nbsp;J.
    stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Sections
    4 and 5 of the<i><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'> Family Law Act, 1986</span></i> create a two-step property division process that emphasizes the distinction
    between <i>the determination of legal and equitable ownership</i> and the
    equalization of net family property.&nbsp; These sections require a court first
    to determine individual “ownership piles” and then to equalize the spouses’
    assets by ordering the spouse with the larger ownership pile to pay money to
    the spouse with the smaller pile.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Before property
    can be equalized under s. 5 of the<i><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'> Family Law Act, 1986</span></i>, a court is required by s. 4 to determine the
    “net family property” of each spouse.&nbsp; Under section 4(1) this is defined
    as “the value of all property . . . that a spouse <i>owns</i> on the valuation
    date”.&nbsp; “Property” is defined in the same subsection as “any interest,
    present or future, vested or contingent, in real or personal property”.&nbsp;
    This all-encompassing definition is wide enough to include not only legal but
    beneficial ownership.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cory&nbsp;J. continued at para.&nbsp;44:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The distinction
    between a share in <i>ownership</i> and a share in <i>property value</i> through an equalizing transfer of money is more than an exercise in judicial
    formalism.&nbsp; This distinction not only follows the two-step structure of
    the<i><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua"'> Family Law Act, 1986</span></i> <i>but reflects conceptual and practical differences between ownership and
    equalization</i>.&nbsp; <i>Ownership encompasses far more than a mere share in
    the value of property.&nbsp; It includes additional legal rights, elements of
    control and increased legal responsibilities</i>.&nbsp; In addition, it may
    well provide psychological benefits derived from pride of ownership.&nbsp;
    Where the property at issue is one to which only one spouse has contributed, it
    is appropriate that the other spouse receive only an equalizing transfer of money.&nbsp;
    But where both spouses have contributed to the acquisition or maintenance of
    the property, <i>the spouse who does not hold legal title</i> should be able to
    claim an interest in that property by way of a constructive trust and <i>realize
    the benefits that ownership may provide</i>.&nbsp; The imposition of a
    constructive trust recognizes that the <i>titled spouse</i> is holding property
    that has been acquired, at least in part, through the money or effort of
    another.&nbsp; The <i>non-titled</i> spouse’s constructive trust interest in
    this property is distinct from the right to an equalizing share of property
    value that is derived not from an independent property right but from the
    status as a married person.  [Emphasis

    deal with and determine the constructive trust claims.&nbsp; The second step
    that must be taken is to perform the equalization calculations.&nbsp; Once this
    is done, a court must assess whether, given the facts of the particular case,
    equalization is unconscionable.&nbsp; The section 5(6) analysis, even if it
    could be considered, would be a third step -- a last avenue of judicial
    discretion which might be used in order to bring a measure of flexibility to
    the equalization process.&nbsp; This step in the process, if it could be used,
    would have to be kept distinct from the <i>preliminary determinations of

    IAM&nbsp;Gold, that had been issued to him between March&nbsp;8,&nbsp;1996 and
    February&nbsp;22,&nbsp;2000, but which did not vest until after the valuation

    December&nbsp;12,&nbsp;2001, three and one half months after the valuation
    date, 245,000 IAM&nbsp;Gold employee stock options were issued to the
    appellant.  It was not until
    April,&nbsp;2005, that the appellant exercised all 420,000 options.  The appellant’s position is that since he
    did not own the 245,000 stock options on the valuation date, the trial judge
    erred in including them within his net family property.  In the alternative, the appellant submits
    that if the trial judge was correct in including the December&nbsp;2001 options
    within his net family property, she erred in her valuation of them.  Finally, the appellant submits that the

    consisted of a combination of a base salary, a bonus and a grant of stock
    options.  However, a grant of employee
    stock options was within the discretion of the board of directors of
    IAM&nbsp;Gold and options were not granted every year.  During the appellant’s employment at

    pertaining to the 245,000 options:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>In January, 2000, the
    husband was appointed CFO of Iamgold. Larry Phillips, corporate counsel and
    corporate secretary at Iamgold, testified that options <i>were not issued every
    year</i>, <i>were discretionary</i> and were based on the prior year’s
    performance. He testified that each year, the compensation committee would
    review whether options should be granted and, that generally, the senior
    executives would be considered as a group. He testified that there might have
    been a single grant of options to the husband when he was promoted to CFO.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>On December 12,
    2001, the husband was granted 245,000 stock options at $3.90 per share. The
    letter from the CEO of Iamgold to the husband which advised of the grant
    referred to the past year’s significant progress towards increased value for
    the shareholders and the company’s sincere appreciation of the husband’s
    efforts. The husband testified that these options were to bring him into line
    with the other senior executives in the company upon his appointment as CFO.
    There was no evidence as to what amount of stock options other senior
    executives received in December, 2001. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>I am
    satisfied that this is an accurate summary of the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I understand the trial judge’s reasons, the following would
    appear to be her net family property analysis and her finding that the 245,000
    stock options were part of the appellant’s net family property:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I
    do not accept the wife’s constructive trust claim for one-half of the stock
    options issued to the husband.  The wife
    is entitled to have included in net family property the stock options <i>received
    or earned</i> by the husband by the date of separation.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Approximately 4
    months after separation, 245,000 stock options were issued to the husband.  The letter from the employer announcing the
    grant of stock options in December, 2001, states that the grant reflected the
    husband’s efforts during the then almost completed year.<span
class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a href="#_ftn9"
name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a></span>  While both the husband and Larry Philips
    commented that stock options were issued to the husband to bring him into
    parity with other senior executives when he was promoted to CFO, there was no
    evidence as to what portion of the stock options were for this purpose.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>On balance, I
    conclude that the 245,000 stock options were given for work done by the husband
    for the prior year.  As the separation
    occurred after 8 months of 2001, 8/12 of 245,000 stock options issued in
    December, 2001 should be included in net family property.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

    December&nbsp;2001 options were the appellant’s net family property because he
    had “earned” them by the valuation date, and because they were “given for work
    done” by the appellant during the marriage.  However, the trial judge failed to make a finding that the appellant
    owned the options on the valuation date.</p>

    noteworthy that exceedingly little attention was devoted to the 245,000
    employee stock options granted to the appellant after valuation date.  Both Mr.&nbsp;Phillips and the appellant
    barely touched on this subject in their testimony.  The appellant’s valuator, Melanie Russell, did not value these
    options.  She valued only the 175,000
    options that the appellant owned on valuation day.  And even in respect to this valuation, her testimony was
    brief.  It is likely that the appellant
    did not consider the 245,000 options to be part of his net family property as
    he did not own them on valuation day, and his case was litigated on this
    premise.</p>

line-height:normal'>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s position is that on the valuation date he did
    not own the 245,000 employee stock options that were granted to him by his
    employer, IAM&nbsp;Gold, some four months thereafter.  Consequently, he submits, the trial judge erred in her finding
    that the options formed part of his net family property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s submission is based on a plain reading of
    s.&nbsp;4 of the <i>FLA</i>.  As “net
    family property” is defined as “the value of all property…that a spouse owns on
    the valuation date”, and as he did not own the stock options until they were
    granted to him subsequent to the valuation date, he submits that he did not,
    and could not, have owned them on that date.  He concedes that had he owned the 245,000 options on the valuation date,
    even though they may have been unvested and subject to a number of conditions,
    including a condition that he could not exercise them for a number of years,
    like the 175,000 employee stock options that he owned on the valuation date,
    they would have constituted “property” within the broad meaning of that term in
    s.&nbsp;4(1).  As they would have formed
    part of his net family property, the court would be required to assign a value
    to the options as of the valuation date.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the appellant emphasizes the fact that even though
    the 245,000 options would have constituted property within the meaning of
    s.&nbsp;4(1), this could not establish his ownership of them because they were
    not given to him until several months later.  Under the <i>FLA</i>, a spouse’s ownership of property on the valuation
    date is central to the equalization analysis.  In other words, although the 245,000 stock options would constitute
    “property” within the meaning of s.&nbsp;4(1) of the <i>FLA</i>, this fact is
    not capable of establishing his ownership of them on the valuation date if they
    did not exist on that date.  As the
    options were not owned by the appellant on the valuation date, they were not
    net family property and their value was not subject to equalization.  He submits, and I agree, that the error made
    by the trial judge in what appears to be her net family property analysis was
    her finding that the 245,000 phantom stock options were net family property
    because they were property within the meaning of s.&nbsp;4(1) of the<i> FLA</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, the appellant’s argument is straight forward.  The December&nbsp;2001 stock options did not
    exist on the valuation date of August&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2001.  On that date the appellant did not own them,
    nor did he have any entitlement to them because their issuance and grant were
    within the discretion of the board of directors of his employer.  The board may not have granted him any
    options for 2001.  As the net family
    property equalization scheme in the <i>FLA </i>is premised on the determination
    of what property is owned by a spouse on the valuation date and the value of
    the property on that date, the trial judge erred in finding that the
    December&nbsp;2001 options constituted a portion of his net family
    property.  The appellant adds that the
    correct principle is that if an asset does not exist on the valuation date, it
    does not form part of a spouse’s net family property even if, when the spouse
    subsequently acquires the asset, it is connected in some manner to his or her
    employment or compensation during the marriage.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support of his position the appellant relies on the
    decision of this court in <i>Leckie v. Leckie</i> (2004), 238 D.L.R. (4th) 571
    (Ont. C.A.), a case that was not considered by the trial judge.  In <i>Leckie</i> the appellant had received
    a severance package from his employer, the amount of which was calculated on
    his years of employment.  It was
    received after he and his wife separated, which was the valuation date.  The trial judge included the value of part

    separation, which was the valuation date, for the purpose of calculating the
    equalization payment.  Perkins&nbsp;J.
    approached the issue by determining whether the amount of the severance package
    was property which is defined in s.&nbsp;4(1) of the <i>FLA</i> to be “any
    interest, present or future, vested or contingent, in real or personal
    property”.  He concluded that it was not
    and, therefore, was not part of the husband’s net family property.</p>

    only part of which was reproduced in <i>Leckie</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I
    think it is stretching the definition of property in section 4(1) of the <i>Family
    Law Act</i> to conclude that something that did not exist and to which the husband
    had no right at the time of separation should be considered his property, as of
    separation, merely because the method of calculating his entitlement to
    severance some 16 months later includes time during which the parties were
    married and living together.  Fortunately I am reinforced in my conclusion by the courts’
    consideration of the issue of severance pay and similar employee entitlements
    in the Ontario cases of <i>Emond v. Emond</i> (1987), 10 R.F.L. (3d) 107 (Ont.
    C.A.) (severance pay received before separation is “property”); <i>Gasparetto
    v. Gasparetto</i> (1988), 15 R.F.L. (3d) 401 (Ont. S.C.) (retirement incentive
    payment entirely discretionary and subject to cancellation by employer not
    “property”); <i>Melanson v. Melanson</i> (1991), 34 R.F.L. (3d) 323 (Ont. Ct. Gen.
    Div.) (Canadian Forces severance pay from a retirement “shortly” after
    separation is “property” – no discussion of when severance pay entitlement
    arose, leading me to conclude that there must have been no issue made about its
    existence at separation); <i>Cliche v. Cliche </i>(1991), 36 R.F.L. (3d) 297
    (Ont. C.A.) (accumulated sick leave credits as of separation are “property”); <i>Blais
    v. Blais</i> (1992), 38 R.F.L. (3d) 256 (Ont. Ct. Gen. Div.) (retirement
    incentive payment similar to the package involved in this case, with no
    evidence that payment was offered before separation, not “property”); see also <i>Purcell
    v. Purcell</i> (1995), 11 R.F.L. (4th) 181 (Ont. Ct. Gen. Div.) (retroactive
    pay under pay equity legislation is akin to severance pay and is “property”,
    even though the employer announced implementation of pay equity four months
    after separation and the employees’ union accepted the employer’s offer of a
    package nine months after separation).  It may be that the <i>Purcell</i> case is distinguishable because the
    payment there involved the implementation of a statutory scheme that was in
    existence, even though the form and amount of the benefit had not been put in
    place at the time of separation; or it may be that <i>Purcell</i> is out of
    step with the other cases.  In any event, <i>Blais</i> is directly on point, and the court in that decision adopted the
    reasoning of <i>Gasparetto</i> that the issue is whether there was a present or
    future right to, or a vested or contingent interest in, a payment.  There being no such right here to the Bell
    severance package as of June,&nbsp;1994, the severance package is not
    “property” within the meaning of section&nbsp;4(1) of the <i>Family Law Act</i>.</p>

    issue was owned by the spouse on the valuation date as required by <i>Rawluk</i>.  However, they effectively did so by
    employing the definition of property in s.&nbsp;4(1) of the <i>FLA</i>,
    deciding whether the property in issue was property within the meaning of
    s.&nbsp;4(1) and then finding, as the property did not exist on the valuation
    date, that it was not part of the spouse’s net family property.  Clearly, had the <i>Leckie</i> and the <i>Marquardt</i> courts first considered whether the severance packages were owned on the
    valuation date, they would have concluded that they were not, as the severance
    packages neither existed on the valuation date, nor did the spouses have an
    entitlement to them.  The same result
    would, of course, have been reached – the severance packages were not part of
    the net family property of the respective spouses as they were not owned on the

    completely discretionary on the part of the Department of National
    Defence.  Campbell&nbsp;J. characterized

    no mention of ownership of the options.  As a threshold issue, the trial judge was required to determine
    ownership.  Nor did she determine
    whether the options were “property” within the meaning of s.&nbsp;4(1) of the <i>FLA</i>.  As I understand her reasons, she proceeded
    directly to determining whether the 245,000 options were subject to
    equalization and held that they were because they “reflected the husband’s
    efforts during the then almost completed year”.  Moreover, the trial judge ignored the undisputed facts that the
    options did not exist on the valuation date, and that there was no entitlement
    to the options on that date as it was within the discretion of IAM Gold’s board

    trial judge valued the 175,000 stock options on an  “if and when” basis.  Rouleau&nbsp;J.A. holds, and I agree, that she erred in doing so.  The trial judge had before her, through the
    testimony of the appellant’s expert, Ms.&nbsp;Russell, a valuation of $49,2000
    which she calculated by using the widely accepted Black&#8209;Scholes
    model.  However, the trial judge
    rejected Ms.&nbsp;Russell’s evidence in its entirety and went on to value the
    options, using her own method, at $424,313.00.  As I will explain, in my view the trial judge erred in rejecting
    Ms.&nbsp;Russell’s evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, I believe that the trial judge rejected the expert’s evidence because
    she misapprehended the Black&#8209;Scholes model of valuing stock options.  However, in fairness to her, I am bound to
    say that Ms.&nbsp;Russell’s evidence was poorly presented.  The trial judge rejected Ms.&nbsp;Russell’s
    evidence for these brief reasons contained in para.&nbsp;62:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[Ms.
    Russell] made a number of assumptions in making her calculation [of the value
    of the 175,000 options].  She did not
    explain her other assumptions or why she considered them appropriate.  I did not find her evidence helpful or
    persuasive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    of the nature of employee stock options, which I will discuss, their valuation
    is not a simple task.  The most common
    valuation method in marital division cases is the Black&#8209;Scholes model.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[11]</span></a>  The Black&#8209;Scholes model was designed
    by Fisher&nbsp;Black and Myron Scholes<a
href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[12]</span></a> in the 1970s.  It has been used ever
    since by professionals and investors for stock option valuations.  Although it was developed to value tradable
    options, it is also used to value options where the shares of the company are
    traded but the options themselves are not, as in this case.  While it is beyond the scope of these
    reasons to explain the model in detail, it is important to recognize that it is
    a complex method that reflects the interrelationship between market value and
    exercisability by taking into account eleven different variables.  The model accounts for the five factors
    affecting market value of an option, including an option’s intrinsic value, an
    option’s time to execution, the value of the underlying security, market
    interest rates, and dividends.  The
    model also integrates six variables affecting the exercise of an option,
    including the price of the option, the market price of the underlying security,
    the expiration date of the option, the underlying security’s volatility,
    current interest rates, and the dividends of the underlying security.  Moreover, in considering only the
    information available on the valuation date, the Black&#8209;Scholes model
    conforms with the valuation approach in the <i>FLA. Cf. Best v. Best</i>,
    [1999] 2 S.C.R. 868 at paras.&nbsp;49 and 62.  See Lynn Curtis, “Valuation of Stock Options in Dividing Marital
    Property Upon Dissolution” (1998) 15 J. Am. Acad. Matrim. Law, 411 at 440.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    “assumptions” which the trial judge said were made by the appellant’s expert in
    valuing the 175,000 stock options at $49,200 by using the Black&#8209;Scholes
    model included the five factors and six variables inherent in the application
    of the model.  These factors and
    variables, which are integral to the Black&#8209;Scholes model, troubled the
    trial judge and resulted in her rejection of Ms.&nbsp;Russell’s opinion.  They formed part of Exhibit&nbsp;75, which
    contains the supporting documentation for her valuation calculations.  Thus, it would appear that the trial judge
    misapprehended the expert’s evidence when she found it to be unhelpful and
    unpersuasive.  This constituted an error
    in law and permits this court to act on the expert’s valuation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would add, in determining the value of any property forming part of a spouse’s
    net family property, that it is important to recognize that it is the value of
    the property on the valuation date that must be determined.  Invariably, this will require the opinion of
    an expert.  In the case of valuing
    employee stock options, I would agree with Rouleau&nbsp;J.A.’s endorsement of
    the Black&#8209;Scholes model, which has become the widely accepted model for
    this purpose.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have stated, the <i>FLA</i> clearly requires that there be ownership of
    property on the valuation date.  The Act
    clearly fixes the valuation date for ownership, valuation and distribution
    purposes.  I appreciate that in cases
    involving employee stock options granted to a spouse after the valuation date,
    wholly or partly, in recognition of the spouse’s work performance during the
    period of the marriage, an apparent inequity may arise from the Act’s
    requirement that all property for distributive purposes must be owned on the
    valuation date.  This is because on
    equalization the other spouse would be denied the benefit of the options
    granted in recognition of the owning spouse’s efforts during the marriage.  However, in such cases, this inequity may be
    ameliorated where the former husband is paying spousal support.  Where the exercise of the options results in
    a significant financial advantage, the former wife can rely on this should she
    apply to vary the amount of support.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    all of the foregoing reasons it is my view that the trial judge erred in
    including the 245,000 December&nbsp;2001 stock options in the appellant’s net
    family property and in placing a value of $424,313.00 on the 175,000 stock
    options that formed part of his net family property.  In my view, based on Ms.&nbsp;Russell’s use of the Black&#8209;Scholes
    model, the proper value of these options on the valuation date was $49,200.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the frequency that employee stock options feature in the division of
    matrimonial property in the American cases, it is surprising that there are so
    very few such cases in Canada<a href="#_ftn13"
name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[13]</span></a>.  Because it is reasonable to assume that
    there will be more Canadian cases, I feel that it is appropriate to make a few
    comments on the subject.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    her helpful survey article,<a href="#_ftn14"
name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[14]</span></a> Prof.&nbsp;Thomas points out that one of the most valuable assets in family law
    cases is an employee stock option (“ESO”).  However, in her opinion the law has failed to keep up with this modern
    form of employee compensation and has struggled to understand this new form of
    property in the context of dividing and distributing marital property on
    dissolution.  As ESOs represent
    potentially huge payoffs for employees, the non&#8209;owning spouse naturally
    wishes to obtain a share of the benefits derived when the options are
    exercised.  Prof.&nbsp;Thomas’s thorough
    analysis of dozens of cases from many states illustrates that American family
    law courts have not developed a uniform approach on how to treat such
    contingent, yet potentially valuable, interests in the division of marital
    property in the context of divorce.  Prof.&nbsp;Thomas states that the law has been slow to address the new property
    of the ESO and instead has tried to conform options to the existing legal
    parameters of pensions, deferred compensation, fringe benefits, or publicly
    traded stocks.  In her view, these
    analogies all fail to adequately address the relevant legal questions because
    ESOs do not fit the characteristics of these other forms of property.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    most, if not all, of the cases which Prof.&nbsp;Thomas reviews, the issues are
    similar to those that a Canadian court would likely encounter.  These issues are: characterizing ESOs as
    marital or separate party; determining the value of the option on the
    equivalent of Ontario’s valuation date; and distributing or dividing the
    option, or its value, between the parties.  In my view, there is much to learn from Prof.&nbsp;Thomas’s article.  It discusses from the American perspective
    issues emerging from the unique characteristics of ESOs that bear upon the
    issues in this appeal.  I did not
    incorporate in my analysis any reference to American authorities as we were not
    referred to them by counsel.  As
    American cases may have a role to play in future cases, I suggest that
    Prof.&nbsp;Thomas’s article should be read by those interested in the subject
    of ESOs as marital property.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    following description of an ESO at pp.&nbsp;501&#8209;503 illustrates its
    unique characteristics and the difficulties which they create in determining
    whether an ESO is marital property:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Courts
    have initially struggled with the question of whether the contingent interest
    represented by the ESO constitutes property that can be distributed in the
    context of a dissolution.  The
    contingent nature of the option, meaning that the employee may never acquire
    any actual interest through the option, and the ability of the employee to
    actually use the option to purchase stocks have been two key factors that have
    guided the courts in their decisions characterizing ESOs as property or non&#8209;property.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;page-break-after:avoid;'><i>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></i><i>Characteristics
    of an Employee Stock Option</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In order to
    characterize the ESO as property for purposes of division upon separation or
    divorce, a court must first understand the descriptive components that comprise
    the option.  An ESO is a contractual
    right granted to an employee for past, present, or future services that gives
    her the right to choose to exercise the option to purchase company stock at a
    designated time.  The option typically
    is nontransferable and nonassignable and thus can only be utilized by the
    employee herself.  The option generally
    requires continued employment with the firm in order to take advantage of the
    option at the designated exercise date.  At the time the option is granted, it usually has no value until such
    time as the employee exercises the option to purchase company stock at a below&#8209;market
    price, which may result in profits upon a subsequent sale of that stock.  Courts sometimes discuss employee options in
    terms of qualified and nonqualified but these are simply designations used by
    the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to determine the point in time at which the
    option will be taxed as income.  Of
    course, as a contractual creature, an ESO can be defined in an individual stock
    plan in a variety of different forms, and the contract can alter any of these
    usual characteristics of the option.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>There are
    several important operational characteristics of an ESO.  First, the option is <i>granted</i> when the
    employer gives or awards the option to the employee, that is, usually by
    contract or upon employment.  The option
    then becomes exercisable at the point in time when the employee can use the
    option to purchase shares of stock.  Typically, the date on which the option becomes exercisable is
    designated in periodic increments following the initial grant date: for
    example, a grant of options upon employment might become exercisable beginning
    eighteen months later and continuing in six&#8209;month periods.  In addition, some courts also use the
    pension terminology <i>mature</i> to characterize the time period at which the
    employee has the right to access the stock option.  In the ESO context, however, the label <i>mature</i> connotes the
    same operative period as exercisable; both are when the employee can access the
    option to buy corporate stock.  The
    question for the courts is what relevance, if any, these characteristics of the
    ESO have to the determination of the option as property.  [Footnotes omitted.]  [Emphasis in the original.]</p>
