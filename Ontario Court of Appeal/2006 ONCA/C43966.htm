    27, 2005, ordering him to pay the sum of $25,000.00 plus pre-judgment interest
    to the respondent.  In addition, the

    alteration of the contract between the respondent as lender and Global Digital
    Solutions Limited as borrower so as to discharge the appellant from his
    personal guarantee; and </p>

  <h3><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>BACKGROUND</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In April 1998, the appellant became an officer and director of
    Global Digital solutions Limited (“GDS”) following business dealings with Gerry
    Jutsun, the principal of GDS. Although the appellant eventually became
    president of GDS, Mr. Jutsun remained responsible for the day-to-day operations
    of the company in his capacity as General Manager.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1999, the respondent agreed to advance a loan to GDS in the
    amount of $100,000.00 on terms that the appellant provide a personal guarantee
    for $25,000.00.  On June 4, 1999, GDS
    and the appellant signed a commitment letter accepting the terms on which the
    respondent was prepared to advance the loan.  Under the heading Security, the commitment letter included the following
    requirements: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The following
    security, evidenced and registered in form and substance satisfactory to the
    Bank and its counsel, is to be provided prior to drawdown under the facility: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>… </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Copies of
    confirmed future contracts to substantiate future cash flows of the
    company.  </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>DISCUSSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that on the evidence of both the
    appellant and the respondent the requirement for confirmed future contracts was
    a material term of the loan agreement and that the trial judge erred in holding
    that it was for the sole benefit of the respondent.   The appellant submits that because it is clear on the evidence
    that neither the respondent or its counsel received copies of confirmed future
    contracts after the commitment letter was signed, the trial judge erred in
    failing to find that the appellant was discharged from his guarantee based on a
    material variation of the loan agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree.  The trial
    judge made a finding of fact that the requirement in the commitment letter was
    satisfied because the Bank received a number of future customer contracts
    before the commitment letter was signed.  While the appellant does not challenge the trial judge’s finding
    concerning the receipt of the contracts, the respondent contends that the trial
    judge made an error concerning when the contracts were received and by
    whom.  In our view, whether the
    contracts were received before or after the commitment letter was signed, the
    trial judge made no error in holding that the fact that  contracts were received was sufficient to
    satisfy the requirement in the commitment letter.  In light of this conclusion, it is unnecessary that we decide
    whether the requirement for confirmed future contracts was a material term of
    the commitment letter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In relation to costs, the appellant contends that the trial
    judge failed to fix an amount for costs that is fair and reasonable for the
    unsuccessful party to pay having regard to the nature of the issues, the amount
    in dispute and the fact that the trial lasted only one day.  We agree.  In all of the circumstances, in our view, an appropriate figure for
    costs in the action below is $25,000.00.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant did not seek leave to appeal costs but the
    respondent raised no objection on that ground.  For the foregoing reasons, leave to appeal costs is granted and the
    appeal as to costs is allowed.  The trial
    judge’s award of costs is set aside and an award of $25,000.00 inclusive of disbursements
    and applicable G.S.T. is substituted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is otherwise dismissed. Costs of the appeal are
    awarded to the respondent in the amount of $2,500.00 on a partial indemnity
    scale inclusive of G.S.T. and applicable disbursements.</p>
