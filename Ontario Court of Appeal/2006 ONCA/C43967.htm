      is an appeal from the order of the Summary Conviction Appeal Court.  That
      court held that an initial refusal of an adjournment, even if an improper
      exercise of discretion, had not resulted in any miscarriage of justice
      insofar as the trial of the criminal harassment charge was concerned.  The
      Summary Conviction Appeal Court indicated that as matters turned out, the
      trial was adjourned for almost four months before the Crown called any
      evidence on the harassment charge.  The appellant made no efforts to retain
      counsel in that four-month time period, but instead returned to court and
      requested a further adjournment.  That adjournment was denied.  The trial
      proceeded and the complainant on the harassment charge, testified.  The
      appellant cross-examined her at some length, but did not complete his cross-examination.  The
      matter was adjourned for another month.  The appellant appeared on the
      return date with counsel who indicated that he would be prepared to act
      for the appellant for the rest of the trial if it was adjourned so that
      counsel could obtain transcripts of the earlier proceedings.  The trial
      judge refused that adjournment and the matter proceeded without counsel.  </span></p>

      courts are sensitive to an accused’s right to legal representation.  Courts
      must, however, take into account other aspects of the due administration
      of justice when faced with requests for adjournments so that an accused
      may retain counsel:  see <i>R. v. Hazout and Hazout</i> (2005), 199 C.C.C.
      (3d) 474 (Ont. C.A.).  Accepting without necessarily agreeing with the
      Crown’s concession that the refusal of the adjournment on the first trial
      date was an inappropriate exercise of the trial judge’s discretion, it
      is clear that the appellant had ample opportunity to retain and instruct
      counsel before the trial resumed some four months later.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      the brief proceedings on the first day, one witness did give some evidence
      describing the complainant’s demeanour at the time of the alleged harassment.  It
      does not appear to us that this evidence was contentious or particularly
      significant in the context of the rest of the evidence relating to the
      harassment charge.  Assuming that cross-examination of this witness by
      counsel may have somehow been helpful to the appellant, we are entirely
      satisfied that had he acted with any diligence and retained counsel by
      the next trial date some four months later, the trial judge would have
      permitted counsel to recall that witness for additional cross-examination.</span></p>

      refusal of the adjournment in March, absent a suitable explanation for
      the appellant’s failure to retain counsel in the intervening four months
      was fully justified, as was the refusal of the adjournment a month later
      to allow counsel to obtain transcripts of the earlier proceedings.  By
      the time the appellant finally retained a lawyer to come to court with
      him, the complainant had attended for trial on at least three occasions.  She
      was in the middle of a lengthy and difficult cross-examination.  From her
      perspective, a further adjournment would have extended her ordeal and seemed
      akin to a continuation of the harassment she was complaining of at the
      hands of the appellant.  </span></p>

      was also argued that the trial judge did not provide adequate assistance
      to the accused in the course of the trial.  We were not referred to any
      specific instance where the trial judge failed to provide the necessary
      assistance.  This ground of appeal fails.  </span></p>
