    Act, </i>R.S.O. 1990, c. C.38 (the “Act”) affords a statutory right to any
    person, on certain conditions and subject to specific safeguards, to obtain a
    list of the shareholders or members of a corporation governed by the Act.  The primary issue on this appeal concerns
    the interpretation of the access to information scheme established by
    s.&nbsp;307 of the Act. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

    vice-president of Local 419 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and
    Teamsters Canada, a trade union that is the certified bargaining agent for the
    unionized employees of the respondent, The Toronto Humane Society.  The Society is a charitable corporation
    without share capital that is governed, in part, by the Act.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

    Lawrence had been involved with labour relations issues affecting the Society
    since 1996.  In July 2004, he applied
    via the Internet to become a member of the Society.  His membership application was accepted by the Society.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On September 30, 2004, Lawrence
    applied for a list of the members of the Society pursuant to s.&nbsp;307(1) of
    the Act.  After an exchange of
    correspondence, the Society declined to provide the list.  Consequently, in early February 2005,
    Lawrence brought an application under s.&nbsp;332 of the Act and Rule 14.05(2)
    of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, seeking a court
    order requiring the Society to deliver the requested list.</span></p>

    2005 by G. Speigel J. of the Superior Court of Justice.  By judgment dated July 15, 2005, she held
    that Lawrence’s purpose in requesting the list was not “for the benefit or the
    purposes of the Society” but, rather, was “to obtain a benefit for the Union”
    by seeking “to persuade the Society’s members to apply pressure on the
    directors [of the Society] to capitulate in their dealings with the
    Union”.  The application judge concluded
    that Lawrence’s reason for wanting the membership list was not “a reason
    connected to the Corporation” and that his request for the list did not comply
    with s.&nbsp;307 of the Act.  She
    dismissed the application.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

    dismissal.  He argues that the
    application judge erred in her analysis of s.&nbsp;307 of the Act by failing to
    apply the governing principles of statutory interpretation, by embarking on an
    inquiry concerning the anticipated content of his future communications with
    other members of the Society, by holding that his purpose for requesting the
    membership list was “not connected to” the Society, and by failing to apply the
    common law in a manner consistent with the right to freedom of expression
    enshrined in the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  </span></p>

    conclude that the application judge erred in her approach to the legal test
    applicable to the determination of whether Lawrence was entitled to receive a
    list of the Society’s members under s.&nbsp;307(1) of the Act and by concluding
    that his access request was for a purpose “not connected” with the Society.  Accordingly, I would allow the appeal.</span></p>

    officials became members of the Society in early July 2004.  Prior thereto, by letter dated June 28,
    2004, Lawrence had written to various members of the Society concerning
    unresolved grievance proceedings between the Society and certain of its
    unionized employees.  In preparing his
    letter, Lawrence made use of a Society membership list that the Society claims
    was stolen from its offices in June 2004.  Lawrence maintained that he was unaware that the list was stolen and
    said that the copy of the list that he received had been slipped under his
    office door.  There is no suggestion in
    this proceeding that Lawrence or the Union were responsible for the theft of
    the Society’s membership list.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In his letter, Lawrence urged members
    of the Society to challenge the propriety of the decision by the Society’s
    management to use funds donated to the Society to finance the Society’s defence
    of the grievance proceedings.  He urged
    the recipients of the letter “to attend your membership meeting and ask
    questions about the spending of donated dollars”.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Society opposed Lawrence’s
    application for disclosure of its membership list on several grounds.  In an affidavit sworn on March 10, 2005 by
    Michael Connor, the Society’s Managing Director of Corporate Services, the
    Society asserted that Lawrence was not “a <i>bona fide </i>member of the
    Society who aspire[d] to the objectives of the Society” and that his purpose in
    obtaining membership in the Society and, subsequently, in seeking to obtain the
    Society’s membership list under s.&nbsp;307(1) of the Act, was to “effect
    Management/Union relations for the benefit of the Union, not for the benefit of
    the Society or the animals of the Society and the purposes and objectives
    connected to the Society”.  Connor
    claimed:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Lawrence’s sole purpose for becoming a
    member and seeking the Membership List is to benefits <i>[sic] </i>the
    bargaining position for [the Union] and not for any purposes connected with the
    objects of the Society.  His interest is
    for the union that he represents and providing Mr. Lawrence the Membership List
    would be compelling the Society to aid in its own harm or destruction.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In resisting Lawrence’s application for
    access to the Society’s list of members, the Society relied on Lawrence’s prior
    use of the stolen membership list as evidence of how Lawrence would use the
    Society’s membership list in the future if it was provided to him under
    s.&nbsp;307(1) of the Act.  The Society
    claimed that Lawrence’s June 2004 letter was harmful to the Society and that it
    damaged the Society’s relations with its members.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Lawrence denied the Society’s claims
    regarding his motivation for becoming a member of the Society and his purpose
    in seeking access to the Society’s membership list.  In an affidavit sworn on March 31, 2005, Lawrence outlined his
    view that labour relations at the Society had deteriorated dramatically since
    2001, resulting in impaired employee morale, a significant backlog of
    unresolved grievance cases involving the Society’s unionized employees, and the
    expenditure of the Society’s revenues (including donations from the public) to
    defend the escalating number of grievance proceedings.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the same affidavit, Lawrence explained
    his reasons for becoming a member of the Society:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>   In
    fact, it is exactly because I do care about the well-being of the Society that
    I became a member.  It has always been
    and remains my intention to exercise the rights of a member set out in the <i>Corporations
    Act </i>to inform the Society’s members about problems in the management and
    direction of the Society and to lobby the other members to exercise their
    rights to bring about responsible and effective management of the Society.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>   In
    particular, I joined the Society because I had grave concerns about the
    direction in which the Society is headed and the manner in which its funds are
    being allocated.  Because of my position
    in the Union, I am acutely aware that the Society is spending large amounts of
    its funds which it raises by way of donations, in fighting the Union’s
    unresolved grievances at arbitration.  The Society’s use of its scarce resources in such a manner causes me
    great concern that the Society is losing sight of its stated mission, namely the
    protection of animals and the prevention of cruelty and suffering of animals.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'><span lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>   That
    is, I am concerned that the Society’s deteriorating </span>labour<span
lang=EN-US> relations will ultimately have an
    impact on the Society’s viability.  I
    appreciate that others may not share my views, but I feel that it is fair for
    me to share my opinions with the Society’s other stakeholders, which is what I
    propose to do by exercising my rights as a member. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Lawrence also elaborated on his
    purpose in requesting a copy of the Society’s membership list:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   I have grave concerns about the future of
    the Society, its employees and the animals that it is supposed to care for and
    protect.  Many of the Union’s members
    are deeply concerned with recent events at the Society and with the direction
    that the Society appears to be taking.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   It is for that reason that I require the
    Society’s membership list.  I am a
    member of the Society and I wish to bring my concerns to the attention of my
    fellow members.  Without this list, and
    in the face of the Society’s Board’s efforts to deny me access to the list and
    to its by-laws, I will be unable to discuss my concerns with other like-minded
    members who may also wish to see the Society undergo some positive change.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When he was cross-examined on his
    affidavits, Lawrence testified that by becoming a member of the Society, he was
    “playing a role to try to make it better for the Teamster members”, that the
    purpose of his becoming a Society member was “for the membership of the
    [Society]”, that this was “necessary to me to follow through on my
    responsibilities [as a vice president of the Union]”, and that this was “to
    ensure that I got involved in the membership meetings to try to make a change
    for the better for the Union members”.  He also said:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I decided to become a
    member when it became apparent that to try to make a change in the direction
    that the [Society] was taking, that membership would allow me the opportunity
    to attend meetings, to vote, to ask questions, access or I thought access
    information in the running of the [Society], and to openly speak with other
    members of the [Society].</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   My relationship with the [Society] over,
    since 1996 had been a professional relationship and of recent, the only way it
    would appear that one would be able to communicate with the management was to
    be directly involved in the process of a member, and that hence, that’s why I
    applied for membership.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Society maintained that Lawrence’s
    evidence confirmed that his reasons for becoming a member of the Society and
    requesting a list of the Society’s members were unrelated to the protection or
    advancement of the corporate and charitable purposes of the Society.  Connor deposed in a reply affidavit sworn on
    April 7, 2005:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   It is clear from reviewing Mr. Lawrence’s
    Affidavit that Mr. Lawrence’s purpose for requesting the Membership List is for
    purposes connected to his Union functions and as Vice-President of Local Union
    419. … His purpose is to protect and enhance the rights of his Union members <i>vis
    à vis </i>the Society.  The purpose of
    the [Society], being the purpose of the corporation, is set out in its
    incorporating documents and mission statement, which states “to promote the
    humane care and protection of all animals and to prevent cruelty and
    suffering”.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On April 6, 2005, two months after the
    commencement of his application under s.&nbsp;332 of the Act for an order
    directing the disclosure to him of a copy of the Society’s membership list, the
    Society provided Lawrence with a letter notifying him that his membership was
    “issued in error”.  The letter went on
    to say that, “In accordance with its authority under the By-laws as regards
    admission of members, your membership has been revoked by the Board of
    Directors.”  The letter was accompanied
    by a refund of the membership fee previously paid by the Union on behalf of
    Lawrence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At the time of his receipt of this

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Relying on this revocation letter, the
    Society argued before the application judge that Lawrence had no standing to
    seek relief against the Society under s.&nbsp;332 of the Act, because he was no
    longer a member of the Society when his application was argued in May
    2005.  In this court, the Society
    further asserts that the access right created under s.&nbsp;307(1) is qualified
    by s.&nbsp;332 of the Act, with the result that only shareholders, members or
    creditors of a corporation have standing to obtain access to a corporation’s
    membership list under s.&nbsp;307(1) of the Act. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge did not address
    the Society’s challenge of Lawrence’s standing in her reasons. Instead, she
    dealt with Lawrence’s application on the merits. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge acknowledged
    Lawrence’s concerns about the Society’s management and board of directors, the
    alleged deterioration in labour relations between the Society and its unionized
    employees, and Lawrence’s desire to raise these concerns with other members of
    the Society.  She next reviewed the
    corporate and charitable purposes of the Society, as outlined in its
    declaration of incorporation and its mission statement and found, as I have
    mentioned, that Lawrence’s purpose in requesting the Society’s membership list

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[14] Members of a non-share capital corporation

    they would want other members to inform them about issues that vitally affect
    the well-being of the corporation. They would not want a person, such as
    Lawrence (a &quot;Lobbyist&quot;), who signs up as a member in the capacity of
    a Trojan horse, to be able to lobby the members to benefit the Lobbyist's own
    economic interests, interests that have nothing to do with the Society or,
    worse yet, are adverse to the interests of the Society.</p>

    lacked standing to commence his application and to appeal from the dismissal
    thereof raises a threshold issue concerning the alleged mootness of this
    appeal. Accordingly, it is appropriate to address this issue first.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, on this record, this claim
    is without merit. I say this for the following reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Lawrence’s application was brought
    under s.&nbsp;332 of the Act.  That
    section permits a “shareholder or member or creditor” of a corporation who is
    aggrieved by the failure of the corporation to perform a duty imposed by the
    Act, to seek relief from the court in the form of an order directing the
    corporation to perform the duty in question.  In contrast, the access right afforded under s.&nbsp;307(1) of the Act
    is available to “any person”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>During oral argument before this
    court, the Society maintained: that ss.&nbsp;332 and 307(1) of the Act must be
    read together; that s.&nbsp;332 limits the categories of persons who are
    entitled to seek access to a corporation’s membership list under s.&nbsp;307(1)
    to those persons specifically identified in s.&nbsp;332; and that the use of
    the phrase “any person” in s.&nbsp;307(1) was a drafting “mistake”.  I would not accept this argument.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section 307, read as a whole, contains
    no evidence of any legislative intent that the access right established by
    s.&nbsp;307(1) be qualified in the manner urged by the Society.  Nor does s.&nbsp;332 of the Act contain any
    indication of such an intent.  Indeed,
    given the use of the phrase “shareholder, member or creditor” in s.&nbsp;332,
    the use of the phrase “any person” in s.&nbsp;307(1) supports the opposite
    interpretative conclusion.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In addition, the legislative history
    of s.&nbsp;307(1) suggests that the use of the phrase “any person” in
    s.&nbsp;307(1) was deliberate, not inadvertent, and that it was intended to
    extend the access right under s.&nbsp;307(1) to persons beyond those
    specifically enumerated in s.&nbsp;332 of the Act.  I will return to the issue of the legislative history of
    s.&nbsp;307(1) later in these reasons.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I also disagree with the Society’s
    contention that the April 2005 purported revocation of Lawrence’s membership in
    the Society operated to deprive him of standing to bring his application under
    s.&nbsp;332 of the Act.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Lawrence became a member of the
    Society approximately three months before he first requested disclosure of the
    Society’s membership list.  His
    membership application, submitted to the Society via the Internet, was accepted
    in accordance with procedures apparently then in place at the Society for the
    electronic processing of such applications.  It appears that only after the acceptance of Lawrence’s application, the
    Society’s by-laws were amended to require approval of membership applications
    by the Society’s board of directors.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Society contends that Lawrence’s
    membership in the Society was revoked under the authority of and in accordance
    with its by-laws.  The state of the
    evidential record before this court regarding the membership and amendment
    provisions of the Society’s by-laws in July 2004 (when Lawrence became a member
    of the Society) and in February 2005 (when he commenced his application under
    s.&nbsp;332) is unsatisfactory.  However, even assuming (without deciding) that the revocation of Lawrence’s
    membership conformed to the Society’s by-laws, Lawrence was a member of the
    Society in September 2004 when he first requested receipt of the Society’s
    membership list.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Lawrence was also a member of the
    Society throughout the period between October 1, 2004 to February 4, 2005,

    to the Society’s list of members.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It does not appear that any objection
    to Lawrence’s membership status was raised during this period.  To the contrary, the Society confirmed in
    writing the acceptance of Lawrence’s membership application, forwarded a letter
    to Lawrence dated September 7, 2004 (in his capacity as a member of the
    Society) advising of a scheduled annual general meeting of members and, on
    October 21, 2004, responded to a request by Lawrence (made in his capacity as a
    Society member) to inspect the by-laws and the minutes of meetings of members
    of the Society.  The Society did not
    contest Lawrence’s standing as a member of the Society in any of these
    communications.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Lawrence was also a member of the
    Society on February 4, 2005, when he commenced his application under s. 332 of
    the Act.  It was not until April 6,
    2005, after the delivery of Lawrence’s affidavit materials in support of his
    application, that the Society wrote to Lawrence – without prior notice to him –
    purporting to unilaterally revoke his Society membership and asserting that his
    membership was originally issued “in error”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On these particular facts, in my
    opinion, it is not open to the Society to rely on its ‘after-the-fact’
    revocation of Lawrence’s membership in the Society to defeat his s.&nbsp;332
    application and to deprive him of his appeal rights arising therefrom.  In the circumstances here, the Society’s
    revocation notice cannot operate retroactively to strip Lawrence of his
    membership status so as to invalidate legal proceedings properly
    initiated.  To hold otherwise would
    permit the Society to control the outcome of litigation properly commenced by
    one of its members through the arbitrary device of manipulating membership in
    the corporation. This would undermine, and ultimately frustrate, both the
    rights of members and the court’s process.</span></p>

  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span lang=EN-US>   “On the application of a member the King’s

    dispute or question depending in which the applicant is interested; but, even
    in this case, the inspection will be granted to such an extent only as may be
    necessary for the particular occasion.  The rule was formerly sometimes laid down more broadly, and the language
    ascribed to the court in one or two cases might almost lead to the inference
    that members of a corporation have an absolute right, whenever they think fit,
    to inspect all papers belonging to the aggregate body.  But any such doctrine is now exploded; and
    the privilege of inspection is now confined to cases where the member of the
    corporation has in view some definite right or object of his own, and to those

    fundamental importance of access to corporate information to the exercise of
    investors’ and creditors’ rights is a cornerstone of corporate law in
    Canada.  The policy rationales for such

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Information is important for at least two basic
    reasons. First, it allows the shareholders and the securities market as a whole
    to evaluate the relative strengths and weaknesses of the enterprise so that
    they can make informed decisions as to whether or not to invest or continue to
    invest in the company. Second, only with adequate information are the
    shareholders able to evaluate effectively the performance of the corpor-ation’s
    directors and officers and to exercise their rights to have the directors and
    officers accountable for their misdeeds. In a dispute between a dissenting
    shareholder and those in control, the accessibility of information becomes a
    key factor as management’s ready access to the records of the company and other
    inside information gives it a distinct advantage over the individual
    shareholder who may be unable to substantiate his suspicions of wrongdoing with
    documentary proof.</span></p>

    established by s.&nbsp;307(1) is underscored in the Act in two ways.  First, s.&nbsp;307(1) requires the prompt
    provision by a corporation of its shareholder or membership list upon request
    therefor.  The list must be furnished
    within ten days after the filing, in proper form, of the affidavit contemplated
    under s.&nbsp;307(2) of the Act.  Second, s.&nbsp;307(5) provides that a corporation’s failure to produce
    the requested list in accordance with s.&nbsp;307(1) when so required is an
    offence, punishable on conviction by the imposition of a fine upon the
    corporation and, in certain circumstances, upon the corporation’s directors or
    officers personally.  </span></p>

    provides safeguards to the corporation and its shareholders or members against
    the improper use of the information contained in a shareholder or membership
    list furnished under s.&nbsp;307(1).  Section&nbsp;307(4) essentially provides that anyone who uses such a
    list for the purpose of promoting the sale of securities other than those
    issued by the corporation, or for “any purpose not connected with the
    corporation”, is guilty of an offence, punishable on conviction by the
    imposition of a fine of not more than $1000.  The phrase “purposes connected with the corporation” is defined in
    s.&nbsp;307(6) of the Act to include an effort to influence voting by
    shareholders or members of a corporation, among other matters.</span></p>

    satisfied that the information contained in the list will be used for “purposes
    connected with the corporation”.  Rather, s. 307(2) requires that the deponent of the affidavit filed to
    initiate the access request confirm in the affidavit that the list is required
    and will be used “only for purposes connected with” the corporation.  Swearing a false affidavit under
    s.&nbsp;307(2) exposes the deponent of the affidavit to consequent prosecution

    purpose for which such information is sought and the actual use to which the
    information contained in such lists may be put.  Section&nbsp;307(1), in my opinion, is intended to facilitate
    access to the shareholder or membership lists of companies governed by the Act,

    Lawrence argued that the access right established by s.&nbsp;307(1) of the Act
    is ‘absolute’ in the sense that, once the formal pre-conditions to its exercise
    are satisfied, the entitlement to obtain a corporation’s shareholder or
    membership list is automatic and mandatory, without scope for any inquiry by
    the court as to whether the requested list, on the facts of a particular case,
    should be provided.  Lawrence asserts,
    therefore, that the application judge erred by embarking on an inquiry
    regarding the basis for his access request under s.&nbsp;307(1) and his
    intended use of the membership list when the list was provided.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In particular, Lawrence maintained
    that s.&nbsp;307 does not require a person seeking access to a membership list
    under s.&nbsp;307(1) to justify, or even to explain, the access request.  Section 307, he contends, does not
    contemplate that an applicant under s.&nbsp;307(1) will have his or her
    intended communications with other members, consequent upon the delivery and
    use of the membership list, “vetted in advance by the Court, where management
    refuses to comply with its obligations”.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I think that this argument is
    misconceived for several reasons.  First, as I have emphasized, the application at issue was brought under
    s.&nbsp;332 of the Act.  Under that section,
    the court is vested with a broad discretionary remedial authority to make “such
    order” as it thinks fit in the circumstances of the case.  In my view, the meaningful exercise of the
    court’s authority under s.&nbsp;332 in a case like this one, where a failure to
    comply with s.&nbsp;307(1) is asserted, contemplates a limited role for the
    court to scrutinize the basis upon which the failure to comply has
    occurred.  In many (if not all) cases,
    this will involve consideration of the purpose for which the access request
    under s.&nbsp;307(1) was made, with a view to the dual concepts contemplated by
    s.&nbsp;307(2) of the Act, namely, present need for access to a membership list
    and future use of the list, both of which must be for “purposes connected with
    the corporation”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, as a charitable corporation,
    the Society is subject to the inherent supervisory jurisdiction of the court in
    charitable matters:  see <i>Re Public
    Trustee and Toronto Humane Society</i> (1987), 60 O.R. (2d) 236 (H.C.J.) at
    242-44.  Consequently, to the extent
    that Lawrence’s complaint regarding the Society’s response to his
    s.&nbsp;307(1) access request involves an allegation that the Society failed to
    discharge a statutory duty, the court has equitable jurisdiction to assess the
    regularity of the Society’s actions.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, contrary to the position taken
    by Lawrence in his factum regarding the task of a reviewing court on a
    s.&nbsp;332 application related to an alleged breach of s.&nbsp;307(1),
    Lawrence’s counsel candidly acknowledged during oral argument of this appeal
    that the court does enjoy authority to inquire into the purpose for which a
    s.&nbsp;307(1) access request is made.  Counsel argued, however, that this authority must be exercised
    judicially and in accordance with the scheme of s.&nbsp;307 of the Act, in
    order to ensure that access to a membership list is not sought for a subsequent
    unlawful use.  I agree.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fourth, as I have attempted to
    explain, the access right created under s.&nbsp;307(1) of the Act is predicated
    on the need for and the intended use of a membership list for “purposes
    connected with the corporation”.  Section&nbsp;307(2) imposes, as a formal pre-condition to the exercise
    of the access right under s.&nbsp;307(1), an obligation that the applicant
    swear an affidavit confirming that the requested membership list <i>is required</i> and <i>will be used </i>for “purposes connected with the corporation”.  Moreover, s.&nbsp;307(4) makes it an offence
    to use a membership list obtained under s.&nbsp;307 for any other purpose.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Thus, the requirement that an access
    request under s.&nbsp;307(1) arise from “purposes connected with the corporation”,
    although not explicit in s.&nbsp;307(1) itself, is implicitly mandated by the
    obligatory requirements of s.&nbsp;307(2) and by the offence created under
    s.&nbsp;307(4) of the Act.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In these circumstances, where an
    access request is resisted on the basis that the request is allegedly made for
    an improper or unlawful purpose, (<i>e.g. </i>for a purpose that is not
    “connected with the corporation”), it is incumbent on the court on a
    s.&nbsp;332 application to inquire into the purpose for which the membership
    list is sought, and the basis on which its disclosure has been denied, to
    determine whether the access request was made with the requisite connection
    with the corporation.  If this narrow
    range of inquiry is impermissible, the court would be powerless to prevent
    access requests that are manifestly abusive or improper, short of an
    ‘after-the-fact’ prosecution of the applicant for breach of s.&nbsp;307.  I do not believe that this is the intent of
    s.&nbsp;307.  Nor do I understand
    Lawrence to have urged this interpretative outcome.  </span></p>

    membership list where there was “a genuine dispute between [the] members [of

    assumes that an access request under s.&nbsp;307(1) can only succeed where it

    controversy in which the applicant was interested to ground a request to

lang=EN-US>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Society argued before the
    application judge, and it submits before this court, that the meaning of the
    phrase “purposes connected with the corporation” is determined by the expressed
    corporate and charitable purposes of the Society as set out in its constating
    legal documents and mission statement.  The Society maintained, in effect, that these documents establish a
    complete code for the delineation of matters “connected with” the Society
    within the meaning of s. 307, and that any request for information from the
    corporation under s.&nbsp;307(1) must be in the “best interests of the objects

    a particular brand of dog food, it could be argued that the Society and the
    dogs for which it cares will be detrimentally affected.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[14] Members of a non-share capital corporation
    would want other members to inform them about the assets of the corporation;
    they would want other members to inform them about issues that vitally affect
    the well-being of the corporation. They would not want a person, such as
    Lawrence (a &quot;Lobbyist&quot;), who signs up as a member in the capacity of
    a Trojan horse, to be able to lobby the members to benefit the Lobbyist's own
    economic interests, interests that have nothing to do with the Society or,
    worse yet, are adverse to the interests of the Society.</p>

    was premised on the need for Lawrence to demonstrate a link between his purpose
    in seeking to access and use the Society’s membership list and the objects and

    equating the requirement under s. 307 that an access request under s. 307(1) be
    for “purposes connected with the corporation” to a requirement for proof that
    the purpose of the access request accord with the stated objects and purposes
    of the Society, the application judge essentially concluded that the purpose of
    a s. 307(1) access request must be in furtherance of the best interests of the

    respects.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, there is nothing in s.&nbsp;307
    to suggest that the proof of a link between an access request under s. 307 (1)
    and the articulated corporate and charitable objects and purposes of the
    corporation in question is a pre-condition to the entitlement to access a
    membership list under s.&nbsp;307(1).  Nor is there anything in s.&nbsp;307 to suggest that a corporation’s
    expressed objects and purposes circumscribe the intended meaning of the phrase
    “purposes connected with the corporation”, as employed throughout s. 307.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, and importantly, the
    application judge’s approach is inconsistent with the expansive reach of the
    phrase “purposes connected with the corporation” as used in s.&nbsp;307.  Section&nbsp;307(6) of the Act defines the
    phrase “purposes connected with the corporation” in inclusionary and
    non-exhaustive terms.  </span></p>

    dictionary meaning, the word “connected” enjoys a wide construction.  It is defined in the <i>Oxford English
    Reference Dictionary</i>, 2d ed. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, reprint
    2001) (1996) at 305 as “1. joined in sequence. 2. (of ideas etc) coherent. 3.

    the phrase “connected with” or “connected to” is to the same effect.  Recently, in <i>Mantini v. Smith Lyons LLP</i> (2003), 64 O.R. (3d) 505, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2003] S.C.C.A.
    No. 344, this court considered the meaning of a contractual requirement that
    any dispute “in connection with” a partnership agreement be referred to
    arbitration for resolution.  Justice
    Feldman, writing for the court, stated at para. 19:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the case of <i>Denison
    Mines Ltd. v. Ontario Hydro</i>, [1981] O.J. No. 807 (Q.L.) (Div. Ct.), the
    court interpreted the words “arising in connection with” as having “a very
    broad meaning”. The court referred to the House of Lords decision in <i>Heyman
    v. Darwins,</i> [1942] A.C. 356, [1942] 1 All E.R. 337 (H.L.) where Lord Porter
    stated at p. 399 A.C, that the words “ ‘arising out of’ … have a wider meaning”
    than “under”. The Divisional Court went on to hold that “the words ‘arising in
    connection with’ are at least as wide as the words ‘arising out of’ and have a
    very broad meaning” (para. 15). I agree with these interpretations and in
    particular with the conclusion that the phrase “in connection with” has a very
    broad meaning. In my view, it has a broader scope than the phrase “out of”, as
    the dispute need only be connected with the Partnership Agreement, even if it
    does not arise from or out of a specific provision of the agreement.</p>

lang=EN-US>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A similar approach was adopted in <i>Toronto
    Transit Commission v. Ontario (Regional Assessment Commissioner, Region No. 9)</i> (1994), 23 M.P.L.R. (2d) 66 (Ont. Gen. Div.) in the context of determining the
    scope of a tax exemption clause under an Ontario municipal taxing statute,
    exempting from tax lands or easements used “for [a stipulated] purpose” or “in
    connection with” certain forms of transit.  In that case, Lederman J. commented at paras. 9 and 14:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The two phrases, “for
    the purpose of” and “in connection with” which qualify the use of the land in
    order to attract the two exemptions within s.&nbsp;120(1), are commonly found
    in taxation legislation.  One is clearly
    broader than the other.  This was
    pointed out by Campbell J. in <i>Kitchener-Waterloo Real Estate Board Inc. v.
    Regional Assessment Comm-issioner, Region No. 21 et al.</i> (1986), 32 M.P.L.R.
    1 at 11 (H.C.J.) as follows:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>The respondent suggests that the words “in
    connection with” are broader than the words “for the purpose of” and says that even
    if the activity is not caught by the latter, it is caught by the former.  This is an accurate interpretation of the
    plain meaning of the words of the statute.  <i>The word “connection” simply means that there is some relationship
    between two things or activities – that they have something to do with each
    other.  The relationship need not be
    purposive to constitute a connection.  Many activities might be carried out in connection with a particular
    object, as integrally related activities, without being carried out for the
    purpose of that object </i>[emphasis added].</p>

    requiring him to establish that the reason for his access request and the
    intended use by him of the Society’s membership list was to benefit or further
    the interests of the Society, the application judge adopted a “highly
    restrictive” construction of the access scheme envisaged by s.&nbsp;307.  In particular, the application judge’s
    approach to the meaning of the phrase “connected with” is not supported by the
    ordinary meaning of that phrase or with the manner in which it has been
    interpreted by Ontario courts. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, under the scheme of
    s.&nbsp;307, the phrase “connected with the corporation” requires only a
    showing that there is a good faith reason for an access request under
    s.&nbsp;307(1) that is related to or associated with the corporation in some
    legitimate fashion.  This may, but need
    not, include a purpose directly linked to the corporation’s formal objects and
    purposes as reflected in its constating and other corporate documents.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There may well be cases where an
    access request under s.&nbsp;307(1) of the Act is improper, or abusive of the
    affected corporation or its members.  For example, such a case might arise where the purpose of the access
    request and its intended future use are related solely to the personal
    interests or objectives of the applicant and are unrelated to the interests or
    concerns of the corporation or its membership as a whole.  In this event, on a proper record, a dissonance
    between the access request and the corporation may be established.  In other words, notwithstanding the
    expansive ambit of the definition of “purposes connected with the corporation”
    set out in s.&nbsp;307(6) of the Act, the purpose for the access request may be
    found to be ‘unconnected’ with the corporation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>But that is not this case.  The record here indicates that access to the
    Society’s membership list was sought by Lawrence to permit him to advocate with
    other Society members, on behalf of the Society’s unionized employees, for
    changes to the management and general labour relations policies and practices
    of the Society.  This purpose, although
    perhaps unwelcome to the management of the Society, affects the Society’s
    membership as a whole and, hence, is clearly related to or associated with the
    Society.  The fact that Lawrence acted
    in the interests of the unionized employees of the Society in making his access
    request does not mean that the basis for his request was unconnected to the
    Society.</span></p>

    herself recognized that members of a non-share capital corporation “would want
    other members to inform them about the assets of the corporation”.  The funds received by the Society from
    donors form part of the ‘assets’ or revenues of the Society.  Lawrence’s main concern regarding the
    Society was that, as part of the general policy adopted by the Society’s
    current leadership to labour relations issues, the Society’s funds, including
    donations, were being used to finance a grievance policy with which he
    disagreed.  This use of the Society’s
    funds is a matter squarely “connected with” the Society.</span></p>

    the United States to support the application judge’s holding that an access
    request under s.&nbsp;307(1) of the Act must be for a purpose that is in the
    best interests of the corporation, as measured by reference to the
    corporation’s objects and purposes:  <i>Charles

    cases arise: in the context of different statutory regimes for the provision
    and control of access to and the use of corporate information; under
    legislation the language of which differs from that employed in the Act; and in
    a jurisdiction where shareholders’ rights to access corporate information (as
    distinct from the rights of directors) have been the subject of considerable
    litigation and divergent judicial opinion:  see for example, K.P. McGuinness, <i>The Law and Practice of Canadian

    the Supreme Court of Minnesota dismissed an appeal from an order denying the

    shareholder ledger and other corporate documents on the basis that the statute
    at issue permitted such access only where the purpose of the requested access

    s.&nbsp;307(1) of the phrase “any person” necessarily contemplates that an
    applicant under s.&nbsp;307(1) need not be an existing or even prospective
    shareholder or member of the affected corporation.  It follows that the purpose of a s.&nbsp;307(1) access request
    need not be tied to the applicant’s status as a shareholder or member of the
    corporation, or to his or her financial or economic interests.</span></p>

    possibility that this argument might prevail in a proper case, that is not this
    case.  The Society has not established
    that Lawrence’s access request is in any sense unlawful; nor does the Society
    suggest that Lawrence’s access request contravenes the collective bargaining
    regime in place between the Society and the Union, or that it relates to a
    matter that could not properly be the subject matter of a vote at a meeting of
    Society members.</span></p>

    may (but also may not) result in financial advantage to the Union (by reducing
    its costs of prosecuting pending grievance proceedings), as well as benefit to
    the Society’s unionized members (by influencing the response to or outcome of
    grievance proceedings) does not produce a ‘disconnect’ with the Society
    itself.  To the contrary, in my view, it

    Corporation’s shareholder list.  As I
    have mentioned, s.&nbsp;21 of the <i>CBCA</i> allows a shareholder of a
    corporation and other identified persons to require a corporation governed by
    the <i>CBCA</i> to disclose a copy of its shareholder list upon payment of a
    fee and the filing of an affidavit in prescribed form. Under s. 21(9) of the <i>CBCA</i>,
    however, the list may only be used “in connection with” an effort to influence
    shareholder voting, an offer to acquire securities issued by the affected
    corporation, or “any other matter relating to the affairs of the
    corporation”.  Like s. 307 of the Act,
    s. 21(10) of the <i>CBCA</i> creates an offence for the misuse of information

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i><span lang=EN-US>[T]he chambers judge confused motive with use</span></i><span
lang=EN-US>. Section 21(9) [of the <i>CBCA</i>]

    motive but that is irrelevant. One must look to the use of the information. It
    is important to recognize that there is a difference between the purpose in
    using the list (<i>e.g.</i> to contact other shareholders) with the personal
    motive (<i>e.g.</i> to make money or to reorganize the corporation) [underlined

    judge’s decision was to foreclose the possibility that, once obtained and notwithstanding
    Union-related reasons by Lawrence for initiating his request for access to the
    Society’s membership list, the list would be used by him for a purpose also
    connected with the Society.  Merely
    because an applicant under s. 307(1) and the corporation in question are
    potentially or actually adverse in interest does not mean that the applicant
    cannot use the list in a manner connected with the corporation. </span></p>

    the opposite conclusion.  Lawrence
    sought to access the Society’s membership list to communicate with other
    members with the view to effecting change within the Society related to
    management and labour relations issues.  Absent consensual or voluntary changes by the Society’s management and
    directors, this could only be achieved by the vote of Society members.  Thus, this use of the Society’s membership
    list, if realized, is a use envisaged by s. 307(6): it involves an anticipated
    effort to influence voting by the members of the Society.  Accordingly, it is a permitted and
    unobjectionable use of the membership list.  </span></p>
