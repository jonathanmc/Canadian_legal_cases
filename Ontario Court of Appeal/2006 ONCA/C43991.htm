  <p><b>On appeal from the judgment of </b><b>Justice Randall S. Echlin of the
      Superior Court of Justice dated July&nbsp;11,&nbsp;2005.</b></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>BORINS J.A.:</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'>I</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal arises from what Echlin&nbsp;J. characterized as a
    “unique application”.  It raises the question of whether Rule&nbsp;36 of
    the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, which permits a party who intends to
    introduce transcript or videotape evidence of a person at trial may, with
    the leave of the court, examine the person under oath before the trial in
    circumstances where no proceeding has been commenced.  The application judge
    found that it did.  With respect, I disagree.  For the reasons that follow,
    I would allow the appeal.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'>II</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal arises from rather unusual circumstances.  On April&nbsp;17,&nbsp;2002,
    Ajeevan Sivakumar was rushed to hospital.  He was five and a half months
    old.  He had sustained significant injury to the right parieto&#8209;occipital
    region of his brain and skull that required surgical repair.  When the child
    initially presented for medical care, his mother, Ahilaverni Sivakumar, gave
    the history that he had fallen down a stairway while strapped in his car
    seat.  However, approximately six weeks later, she stated that this was not
    the way in which her son had been injured.  Rather, she claimed the injuries
    occurred when he was restrained in his car seat in the rear of a vehicle
    she had been driving when she lost control of it and hit a tree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the child’s father, Murugesu Sivakumar, was the owner of the vehicle that
    was insured by the respondent, on June&nbsp;6,&nbsp;2002, the law firm representing
    the Sivakumar family put the insurer on notice.  In part, its letter read:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This letter will serve as formal notification provided
    on behalf of our client, Ajeevan Sivakumar, minor, and his family, of their
    intention to commence legal action against you for personal injury damages
    arising from injuries sustained by Ajeevan Sivakumar as a result of a motor
    vehicle accident which occurred on the above&#8209;noted date of April&nbsp;17,&nbsp;2002,
    in the City of Scarborough.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . . </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The foregoing information is served in accordance
    with Regulation&nbsp;2(1) made under <i>The Insurance Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    of the conflicting account of how the child was injured, the respondent considered
    that it was prudent to retain three experts to opine on the cause of the
    child’s injuries.  It retained two physicians, Dr.&nbsp;Robert&nbsp;Hollenberg
    and Dr.&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;Knight, who delivered their reports on May&nbsp;18,&nbsp;2004
    and June&nbsp;18,&nbsp;2004 respectively.  At present, Dr.&nbsp;Hollenberg
    is age 65, while Dr.&nbsp;Knight is age 78.  It also retained Saad Nassar,
    an engineer, who delivered his report on August&nbsp;3,&nbsp;2004.  Dr.&nbsp;Nassar
    is age 49.  In the opinion of each of the experts, the child’s injuries were
    probably caused by a fall down the stairs, and not by a motor vehicle accident.  Thus,
    if proceedings are brought against the owner and operator of the Sivakumar
    vehicle, the respondent insurer says that it will defend the action on the
    ground that the injuries were not sustained as a result of an automobile
    accident.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a>  Consequently,
    as I will explain in some detail, the respondent brought an application to
    preserve the evidence of the three experts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
    precipitated the respondent’s application is the lengthy period of time that
    could elapse before Ajeevar asserts a claim for damages.  As he was born
    on November&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2001, and, therefore, a minor when he was injured,
    the two year limitation period that was formerly prescribed by s.&nbsp;206(1)
    of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;8 for bringing
    a claim for the recovery of damages occasioned by a motor vehicle does not
    begin to run until he reaches his majority on November 1,&nbsp;2019:  <i>Limitations
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;15, s.&nbsp;47, which was in force
    at the time of the alleged motor vehicle accident.  Thus, reading these provisions
    together, Ajeevan Sivakumar has until November&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2021, to commence
    an action for damages against the owner and operator of the motor vehicle
    in which his mother claimed he was injured:  <i>Murphy v. Welsh</i>, [1993]
    2 S.C.R. 1069.  This is because s.&nbsp;47 of the former <i>Limitations Act</i> permitted
    the running of time established for a limitation period to be postponed if
    the plaintiff is under a legal disability “at the time the cause of action
    accrues”: <i>Bisoukis v. Brampton (City)</i> (1999), 46 O.R. (3d) 417 at
    para.&nbsp;34 (Ont. C.A.); leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada
    dismissed, [2000] S.C.C.A. No. 52.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was, of course, prudent for the motor vehicle insurer to obtain the experts’ opinion
    regarding the cause of the child’s injuries when the evidence was fresh.  On
    the assumption that the child has until November&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2021 to sue
    its insured, the respondent commenced an application against the child and
    his parents in which it sought the following remedies:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>(b)       a mandatory order requiring
    the examination under oath of witnesses, Saad Nassar, Ph. D., P. Eng. of

style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New Roman"'>(c)       in the alternative,
      an order that the Applicant, TD Insurance Home and Auto, formerly Liberty
      Insurance Company of Canada, formerly Liberty Mutual Insurance Company,
      be granted leave pursuant to Rule&nbsp;36.01 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> to
      examine under oath the witnesses, Saad </span>Nassar, Ph. D., P. Eng. of

    for the Sivakumar family argued before the application judge that her clients
    would be prejudiced by both the cost of retaining their own experts to advise
    their lawyers in cross&#8209;examining the respondent’s experts, and the
    costs of legal fees.  She also argued that the court had no jurisdiction
    to make the order requested by the respondent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge rejected both arguments for the following reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I specifically find that such potential prejudice
    is greatly outweighed by the prejudice that would occur should any such experts
    be lost prior to trial.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mr.&nbsp;Desjardins [on behalf of the insurer]
    has undertaken to have his client cover the costs of the experts’ attendance &amp;
    the costs of recording the event.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Further, Mr. Chobotar [on behalf of the Sivakumar
    family] argued that this court has no jurisdiction to make such an order
    in this instance.  I specifically reject that argument and hold that the
    combined effect of sections 1, 95, 96,101, and 146 of the <i>Courts of Justice
    Act</i>, and Rules 14, and 36 of the Consolidated Rules of Practice permit
    such an order to be made in the circumstance.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Accordingly, I see some significant potential advantage
    to preserving such evidence and that such greatly outweighs any alleged prejudice
    to the respondents.  (Such preservation order is discretionary and I exercise
    my discretion in favour of the applicants, fully cognizant that Rule 36.01(2)(c)
    only requires
    “the possibility of the individual being unable to testify (emphasis added).”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In this unusual instance, I find it to be in the
    interests of the administration of justice to make such order.  As indicated
    by Henry J. in <i>Patterson v. Christie, et al</i> (1983), 41 OR (2d) 145,
    the evidence will be taken and recorded for what it’s worth.  In the end,
    the trial judge will make the determination of what, if any value or weight
    ought to be accorded to it and whether any, part or all is admissible or
    relevant.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the application judge erred in finding that the combined effect
    of ss.&nbsp;1, 95, 96, 101 and 146 of the <i>CJA</i> and Rules 14 and 36
    permitted him to order the taking and the preservation of the respondent’s
    expert evidence, and to compel the injured child and his family to participate
    in their examination and cross&#8209;examination.  Of these statutory provisions
    and rules, only rule 36.01 and s.&nbsp;146 of the <i>CJA</i> need be considered
    as, in my opinion, rule 14 and the other provisions of the <i>CJA</i> have
    no application to the circumstances of this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Considering
    the plain language of rule 36.01, it does not confer any power on the court
    to order the preservation of evidence prior to the commencement of a proceeding,
    which is defined in rule&nbsp;1.03(1), as an action or application.  The
    use of the word “party” throughout Rule 36, in particular, its use in rule&nbsp;36.04(1),
    clearly indicates that it applies only where an action has been commenced
    and one of the parties to the action wishes to preserve the evidence of a
    witness for use at trial, usually in circumstances where the proposed witness
    is ill or of advanced years.  As no action had been commenced on behalf of
    the child  at the time of the application, and, indeed none had been commenced
    at the time of the appeal, rule 36.01 conferred no power on the application
    judge to grant the impugned order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Rules
      of Civil Procedure</i> apply to civil proceedings.  They provide the procedural
      framework for civil proceedings from their commencement to their conclusion.  As
      such, the rules ordinarily have application only to ongoing proceedings,
      as is evident not only from their context but from the use of the word “party” throughout
      the rules.  Although “party” is not defined in the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> or
      the <i>CJA</i>, it is a well recognized legal term of art meaning a person
      by or against whom a legal proceeding is brought.  However, in rule 36.04(1)
      an expansive definition of “party” is provided to cover a number of situations,
      such as where an action is brought by or against a corporation.  Where
      it is intended that a rule apply where no proceeding has been commenced,
      the rule clearly says so, as in rule 7.08(1) that applies to the settlement
      of a claim by or against a person under disability, and rule 40.01 that
      permits a party to an intended proceeding to be awarded an injunctive remedy.  Had
      the Civil Rules Committee intended that Rule&nbsp;36 apply in circumstances
      where no proceeding has been commenced, the rule would have said that.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Succinctly,
    the application judge could not grant the order under appeal unless he had
    the power to do so.  Rule&nbsp;36.01 does not confer that power.  Therefore,
    the application judge did not have the power to grant the impugned order.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'>VII</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the alternative, counsel for the respondent submits that under s.&nbsp;146
    of the <i>CJA</i>, the application judge had inherent jurisdiction to grant
    the order.  In making this submission, counsel argued that the failure of
    rule&nbsp;36.01 to empower the court to grant an order prior to the commencement
    of an action is a
    “procedural gap” that can be cured by the application of s.&nbsp;146, which
    I have reproduced in paragraph 8.  In doing so, counsel has misconstrued
    the meaning of s.&nbsp;146.  As Doherty J.A. said on behalf of this court
    in <i>R. v. Sztuke</i> (1993), 16 O.R. (3d) 559 at 563 (C.A.):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Section 146 does not confer jurisdiction, but refers
    to procedural lacunae where jurisdiction has been otherwise conferred.  The
    absence of any statutory authority permitting a trial judge to decline to
    enter a conviction and instead impose a discharge, is not a matter of procedure.  Section&nbsp;146
    cannot create a jurisdiction to provide a disposition or impose a sentence
    which is not contemplated by the relevant legislation.  The section is of
    no assistance to the respondent.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>That rule&nbsp;36.01 does not apply
    where no proceeding has been commenced is not a procedural gap.  The absence
    of statutory authority enabling the court to act prior to the commencement
    of a proceeding is not a matter of procedure.  It indicates the intention
    of the Civil Rules Committee to confine the application of the rule to situations
    where a proceeding has been commenced.  Accordingly, s.&nbsp;146 cannot be
    applied to confer the power that is not contained in the rule.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the possibility, remote though it may be, that no proceeding would be taken
    by, or on behalf, of the injured child until as late as 2021, and considering
    the dispute about the cause of the child’s injuries, it made good sense for
    the respondent to retain experts to explore this issue at an early stage
    when the evidence was fresh.  Given the ages of two of the experts, it also
    made sense to seek to preserve their evidence through the application of
    rule&nbsp;36.01 to counter the possibility that they would be unavailable
    to testify in the future.  Indeed, had rule&nbsp;36.01 conferred power to
    order preservation of evidence before the commencement of an action, no fault
    could have been found with the application judge’s order other than his failure
    to order the respondent to reimburse the Sivakumar family for all costs and
    expenses incurred in participating in the examination of the respondents’
    experts.  Similar situations may occur in the future.  For that reason, the
    Civil Rules Committee may wish to consider extending the application of rule&nbsp;36.01
    to situations in which no proceeding has been commenced.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    all of the above reasons I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
    of the application judge and order that the application be dismissed.  The
    parties have agreed that there will be no costs of the appeal.</p>
