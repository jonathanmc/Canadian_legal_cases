style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>North
      American Free Trade Agreement</i> <i>Between the Government of Canada,
      the Government of Mexico, and the Government of the United States</i>,
      17 December 1992, Can. T.S. 1994 No. 2, (“NAFTA”) was signed by Canada,
      the United States and Mexico in December 1992, and came into force on January
      1, 1994. This Treaty provides that an investor from one of these three
      NAFTA Parties may initiate a claim to determine, through international
      arbitration, whether another NAFTA Party has violated its treaty obligations
      to treat foreign investors fairly. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue in this case is whether, by agreeing in NAFTA to such tribunals to
    resolve these disputes, the Government of Canada has deprived Canadian superior
    courts of their authority to adjudicate upon matters reserved to them by
    s. 96 of the <i>Constitution Act 1867</i>, or has violated principles of
    judicial independence and the rule of law, or has infringed the <i>Charter
    of Rights and Freedoms.</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    first instance, Pepall J. answered these questions in the negative. For the
    reasons that follow, I reach the same conclusion. I would therefore dismiss
    the appeal.</p>
  <h3><u>BACKGROUND</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties to NAFTA are the governments of Canada, the United States and Mexico.
    A principal objective of the Treaty is to secure and maintain access for
    exporters, service providers and investors from each of these countries to
    the markets of the other two.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal focuses on the investment provisions set out in Chapter 11 of NAFTA.
    Article 1101 provides that this Chapter applies to government “measures” maintained
    by a NAFTA Party relating to investors of another Party and to their “investments” in
    the territory of the first Party.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Measures” are
    defined in article 201 to include any law, regulation, procedure, requirement
    or practice.  In article 1139, “investments” are equally broadly defined
    and include an enterprise, equity securities, debt securities and loans to
    an enterprise.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    critical obligations of each NAFTA Party concerning investors of another
    NAFTA Party are found in Chapter 11, Section A, in articles 1102, 1103, 1104,
    1105 and 1110. They provide that each NAFTA Party must treat those investors
    no less favourably than it treats its own investors or than it treats investors
    from any other nation, whichever is better; that each NAFTA Party must accord
    their investments fair and equitable treatment; and that each NAFTA Party
    is prohibited from expropriating these investments except for a public purpose,
    on a non-discriminatory basis, and after according due process and paying
    due compensation. These provisions read as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Article 1102: National Treatment</b>  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1. Each Party shall accord to investors of another
    Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances,
    to its own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion,
    management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Article 1103: Most-Favoured-Nation Treatmen</b>t  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1. Each Party shall accord to investors of another
    Party treatment no less favourable than that it accord, in like circumstances,
    to investors of any other Party or of a non-Party with respect to the establishment,
    acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other
    disposition of investments.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Article 1104: Standard of Treatment</b>  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1. Each Party shall accord to investors of another
    Party and to investments of investors of another Party the better of the
    treatment  required by Articles 1102 and 1103.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Article 1105: Minimum Standard of Treatment</b>  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.     Each Party shall accord to investments of
    investors of another Party treatment in accordance with international law,
    including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Article 1110: Expropriation and Compensation</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1. No Party may directly or indirectly nationalize
    or expropriate an investment of an investor of another Party in its territory
    or take a measure tantamount to nationalization or expropriation of such
    an investment (“expropriation”). except:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)   for a public purse;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)   on a nondiscriminatory basis;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)   in accordance with due process of law and
    Article 1105(1); and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(d)   on payment of compensation in accordance
    with paragraphs 2 through 6.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    B of Chapter 11 establishes a mechanism for the settlement of investment
    disputes before an impartial tribunal. Article 1116 provides that an investor
    of a NAFTA Party may submit to arbitration a claim that another NAFTA Party
    has breached one of the obligations set out above and that the investor has
    incurred loss or damage as a result. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a condition precedent to submitting a claim, article 1121 provides that the
    investor must consent to arbitration in accordance with the procedure set
    out in NAFTA and must waive its right to take proceedings (except for injunctive
    or other relief not involving payment of damages) before any administrative
    tribunal or domestic court of any NAFTA Party with respect to the measure
    alleged to constitute the breach of obligation. This prevents the investor
    from seeking damages in respect of the same government measure both at arbitration
    under NAFTA and pursuant to the domestic law of any NAFTA Party.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    Article 1122, each NAFTA Party has obliged itself to consent to the submission
    by an investor of a claim to arbitration in accordance with the NAFTA procedures.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Article
    1123 of Section B of Chapter 11 provides that the arbitration tribunal will
    consist of a nominee of the investor, a nominee of the NAFTA Party and an
    agreed presiding arbitrator. In other words, the tribunal is not established
    by the NAFTA Party alone.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Article
    1130 provides that the arbitration must be held in the territory of one of
    the NAFTA Parties, unless the disputants agree otherwise, and that the precise
    selection is to be made in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>NAFTA
    spells out the law by which the arbitration tribunal is to adjudicate the
    dispute. Article 1131(1) reads: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A Tribunal established under this Section shall
    decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement and applicable
    rules of international law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>NAFTA
    also clearly sets out the extent of the remedial authority of the arbitration
    tribunal. Article 1135 provides that it may award only monetary damages together
    with interest, and/or restitution of property. It may also award costs in
    accordance with the applicable arbitration rules. Article 1136 provides that
    the award has no binding effect except between the investor and the NAFTA
    Party, and only in respect of the particular case. In other words, the tribunal
    award cannot invalidate the impugned government measure or have any other
    effect on domestic law beyond the disputants and the particular case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    Article 1136 requires that each NAFTA Party must provide for the enforcement
    of the award in its territory. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Canada
    did this by enacting the <i>North American Free Trade Implementation Act</i>,
    S.C. 1993, c. 44 (“the Act”), which came into force on January 1, 1994. Section
    4 of that Act sets out its purpose in clear language, namely to implement
    NAFTA. Section 10 says simply “[t]he Agreement is hereby approved”. Section
    50 amends the <i>Commercial Arbitration Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 17 (2<sup>nd</sup> Supp.)
    to ensure that its enforcement provisions apply to NAFTA arbitration awards.
    Thus, investors can enforce them against Canada in the domestic courts of
    this country.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    arbitration rules under which a tribunal award is issued provide that the
    award is reviewable in the domestic courts of the place of arbitration. The
    Act makes the necessary changes to the federal commercial arbitration legislation
    to provide for this for awards from NAFTA arbitrations conducted in Canada.
    The grounds on which a domestic court can set aside such an award include
    incapacity, failure to receive notice of the proceedings, where the award
    is beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration, or is in conflict with
    the public policy of Canada.</p>
  <h3><u>THE PROCEEDINGS BELOW</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants are the Council of Canadians, members of the Canadian Union of
    Postal Workers and members of the Charter Committee on Poverty Issues. They
    brought this application to challenge the constitutionality of Canada agreeing
    in NAFTA to set up arbitration tribunals to resolve claims by foreign investors
    that they had suffered damage due to government measures undertaken by Canada.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    standing of the appellants to bring the application was not questioned at
    first instance and is not an issue in this court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    thorough and careful reasons, Pepall J. dismissed the application. She first
    addressed  whether s. 96 of the <i>Constitution Act, 1867</i> applies at
    all to the investor–state arbitration mechanism in Chapter 11 of NAFTA. She
    found that it does not, for two reasons. First, she found that NAFTA has
    not been made part of Canada’s domestic law. Second, she held that, while
    standing is provided to the foreign investor, the obligations enforced by
    NAFTA tribunals are international commitments made in that Treaty by the
    three NAFTA Parties. She concluded that, as an international treaty, NAFTA
    is unaffected by s. 96 of the <i>Constitution Act, 1867</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge went on to apply the tests set out in the s. 96 jurisprudence,
    in the event that that section should be found to reach these NAFTA tribunals.
    She concluded that there was no violation. The tribunals decide only whether
    a NAFTA Party has breached its Treaty obligations, a jurisdiction never exercised
    by superior courts. Moreover, since an aggrieved investor can complain about
    a government measure either to a domestic court or a NAFTA tribunal, she
    found that the latter did not have exclusive jurisdiction to hear disputes
    about contested government measures and hence could not be said to have usurped
    a core function of superior courts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the application judge found that the NAFTA provisions setting up these tribunals
    were not shown to violate any principles of constitutionalism, the rule of
    law, or the <i>Charter</i>,<i> </i>because they (1) do not infringe s. 96,
    (2) cannot invalidate domestic laws or government practices and (3) must
    operate in accordance with the rules of international law. She held that
    the mere establishment through NAFTA of the system of arbitration tribunals
    violates no <i>Charter </i>rights and any question of a <i>Charter </i>violation
    arising from a particular tribunal decision is premature. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a result, the application judge dismissed the application but ordered no
    costs since none were sought.</p>
  <h3><u>ANALYSIS</u></h3>
  <p><b><u>First Issue: Does S. 96 Apply To NAFTA Tribunals At All</u></b>?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants first attack the finding of the application judge that s. 96 simply
    does not reach the tribunals set up under Chapter 11 of NAFTA. They argue
    that the Government of Canada cannot exempt these tribunals from being tested
    against the requirements of s. 96 merely by conferring jurisdiction on them
    through an international treaty. They say that the nature of investor–state
    adjudication conducted by these tribunals is sufficiently integrated with
    the domestic law of Canada through the <i>NAFTA Implementation Act </i>that
    they should attract the application of s. 96. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the application judge correctly determined that the tribunals set
    up under Chapter 11 have not been incorporated into the domestic law of Canada
    which negates one possible basis for applying s. 96 to them. There is a clear
    and well-known distinction between parliamentary approval of a treaty on
    the one hand, and incorporation of that treaty into Canadian domestic law
    on the other. See <i>Canada (A.G.)  v. Ontario (A.G.)</i>,<i> </i>[1937]
    A.C. 326 (P.C.) (<i>Labour Conventions</i>). The <i>NAFTA Implementation
    Act</i> clearly does the former, and just as clearly does not purport to
    do the latter. The provision in the <i>Commercial Arbitration Act </i>that
    makes decisions, once rendered by NAFTA tribunals, enforceable in Canadian
    courts, goes no further than just that. That legislation cannot be seen as
    a determination by Parliament to incorporate into Canadian domestic law the
    entire investor–state adjudication process, including the tribunal’s makeup,
    its procedures, its governing law and the defined limits within which it
    can act. Only the decision it has made is incorporated into domestic law.
    The <i>Commercial Arbitration Act</i> says no more than this, and it is not
    necessary to read any broader meaning into that legislation to make the resulting
    decisions enforceable in Canadian courts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Beyond
    whether NAFTA tribunals have been incorporated into domestic law, the broader
    question is whether tribunals set up by an international treaty signed by
    Canada, but not incorporated into domestic law, are <i>per se</i> immunized
    from scrutiny under s. 96, or whether these tribunals otherwise have sufficient
    links with the domestic law of Canada to warrant the application of s. 96
    to them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants argue that the government cannot immunize a tribunal from s. 96
    merely by setting it up by treaty. This position has some attraction. It
    recognizes that s. 96 is a functional test that can be comfortably applied
    to tribunals whether set up by the executive act of treaty making or by domestic
    legislation, with a resulting benefit to the coherence of the law. However,
    for two reasons I do not propose to attempt a final answer to that question
    in this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the appellants and the respondents seem to agree that the inquiry required
    by such an approach would focus on a determination of the nature of the disputes
    adjudicated by NAFTA tribunals. In essence, this is the same inquiry required
    by the first step of the three-part test established by <i>Reference re Residential
    Tenancies Act (1979) Ontario</i>, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 714 that would be used
    if s. 96 were applied to them. Since at least in the context of these tribunals,
    the same question must be asked whether one is asking whether s. 96 applies
    at all or is applying s. 96, it is probably better addressed in the more
    familiar context of the application of the s. 96 test, rather than as a separate
    threshold question of whether s. 96 applies at all.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    it is unnecessary to address the threshold question in this case because,
    assuming that s. 96 does apply to them, NAFTA tribunals do not violate it.
    The wisdom of judicial minimalism suggests that the determination of whether
    a tribunal set up by international treaty is <i>per se </i>exempt from s.
    96 is best left to a case where it must be decided. </p>
  <h3><u>The Second Issue:  Do NAFTA Tribunals Violate Section 96</u>?<u></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    96 of the <i>Constitution Act, 1867</i> reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Governor General shall appoint the Judges of
    the Superior, District, and County Courts in each Province, except those
    of the Courts of Probate in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    framed as an appointing power accorded to the federal government, it is now
    well established that s. 96 was designed to ensure the independence of the
    judiciary and to provide some uniformity to the judicial system throughout
    the country. See, for example, <i>Reference re Amendments to the Residential
    Tenancies Act, (N.S.),</i> [1996] 1 S.C.R. 186 as para. 26 per<i> </i>Lamer
    C.J.C. Moreover, the application of s. 96 must be addressed in functional
    terms if it is to properly serve these purposes. See<i> McEvoy v. New Brunswick
    (A.G.)</i>, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 704 at 718. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    well-known test for determining whether a conferral of power on an inferior
    tribunal violates s. 96 was set out in <i>Reference</i> <i>re Residential
    Tenancies Act</i> <i>(Ontario)</i>,<i> supra</i> become known simply as the <i>Residential
    Tenancies </i>test. It was reiterated in <i>Reference re Residential Tenancies
    Act</i> <i>(N.S.)</i>, <i>supra</i>, by McLachlin J. (as she then was) at
    para. 74:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It consists of three steps, represented by the
    following questions: (1) does the power conferred “broadly conform” to a
    power or jurisdiction exercised by a superior, district or county court at
    the time of Confederation? (2) if so, is it a judicial power? (3) if so,
    is the power either subsidiary or ancillary to a predominantly administrative
    function or necessarily incidental to such a function? The first two steps
    may be seen as identifying potential violations of s. 96; the last step as
    setting out the circumstances in which the transfer of a s. 96 power to an
    inferior tribunal is
    “transformed” and hence constitutionalized by the administrative context
    in which it is exercised.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if the conferral of the power in question does not transgress the <i>Residential
    Tenancies</i> test, if it constitutes the complete removal from the superior
    courts of a power that is integral to the core or inherent jurisdiction of
    those courts, it will nonetheless violate s. 96. This principle was laid
    out in <i>MacMillan Bloedel Ltd. v. Simpson</i>, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 725, particularly
    at para. 18.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    applying the <i>Residential Tenancies </i>test, the application judge focused
    on the first of these three steps. In my view, the same focus is warranted
    in this court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    McLachlin J. said in <i>Reference Re Residential Tenancies Act (N.S.)</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at paras. 75 and 76, this step is designed to determine whether the power
    conferred on the inferior tribunal is analogous to or in broad conformity
    with one exercised by the courts that became s. 96 courts at the time of
    Confederation. She said that this requires that the power be characterized
    by focusing on the type of dispute involved, rather than on a technical analysis
    of the remedies used by the tribunal. She also directed that in applying
    step one of the test the reviewing court look at the subject matter of the
    disputes being resolved and not the apparatus of adjudication used to resolve
    them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Keeping
    these considerations in mind, I have no doubt that the application judge
    was correct in concluding that the power conferred on NAFTA tribunals is
    not analogous to one exercised by superior courts at the time of Confederation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    type of dispute to be resolved by those tribunals is clearly revealed by
    Chapter 11 of NAFTA, their only source of power. The state obligations they
    enforce are set out in article 11. Article 1102 is the national treatment
    obligation, namely the obligation of each Party to accord investors of another
    Party treatment no less favourable than it accords to its own investors.
    Article 1103 is the most-favoured-nation treatment obligation, namely the
    obligation of each Party to accord investors of another Party treatment no
    less favourable than that accorded to investors of any other state. Article
    1105 is the minimum standard of treatment obligation, that is, the obligation
    of each Party to accord investors of another Party fair and equitable treatment.
    Finally, article 1110 contains the obligation of each Party not to expropriate
    investments from investors of another Party except for a public purpose,
    on a non-discriminatory basis and in accordance with due process and with
    compensation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    are all state obligations mutually undertaken in NAFTA by the three Parties
    signing the Treaty. They derive only from the Treaty. They bind the three
    Parties only because they signed the Treaty. And they regulate only the conduct
    of each Party in adopting measures relating to investors from another Party.
    The NAFTA tribunals only have power to adjudicate upon the consistency of
    governmental measures with these state obligations. Alleged inconsistency
    with these state obligations are the causes of action that NAFTA tribunals
    have authority to determine.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    have been shown nothing that suggests that there were any domestic causes
    of action known to the superior courts at the time of Confederation that
    could be said to be broadly analogous to these international obligations
    to accord national treatment, most- favoured-nation treatment, and fair and
    reasonable treatment to the foreign investors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    only arguable exception is the expropriation obligation contained in article
    1110. However, this is but one particular obligation among those that are
    part of the scheme of powers given to NAFTA tribunals. That scheme is animated
    by the principle of protecting and promoting international investment throughout
    North America by giving investors of any Party the capacity to bring claims
    under NAFTA against another NAFTA Party. This is a quite different principle
    from the traditional domestic law of expropriation which is designed to regulate
    the government taking of domestic private property, not to facilitate the
    flow of international investment in North America. This difference is enough
    to constitute even the expropriation component of the powers of NAFTA tribunals
    a novel jurisdiction different from the expropriation jurisdiction of superior
    courts at the time of Confederation. This basis for finding compliance with
    s. 96 was set out in <i>Reference Re Residential Tenancies (N.S.)</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at para. 94.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to the obligations enforced by these tribunals, the law they must
    apply and the limits on the effect of their decisions are also relevant at
    step one of the <i>Residential Tenancies </i>test. Article 1131 of NAFTA
    obliges the tribunals to decide the disputes before them in accordance with
    NAFTA, and the applicable rules of international law. Article 1136(1) ensures
    that the tribunals have no power to alter or affect domestic laws through
    their awards by providing that these awards have no binding effect except
    between the disputing parties and in respect of the particular case. By contrast,
    the process of superior courts are shaped by domestic law and clearly carry
    effects beyond the immediate litigants and the particular case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary then, these tribunals have been given the power to adjudicate only
    upon alleged breaches of the international obligations mutually undertaken
    by treaty by the NAFTA Parties, obligations which have no counterpart in
    pre-1867 domestic law in Canada. They are to do so using international law
    principles not domestic law, and they are to issue awards which have no effect
    beyond the disputing parties and the particular case. In all these respects
    there is no broad conformity with a s. 96 court power.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the appellants argue that several other aspects of the arbitration system
    set up by Chapter 11 compel the opposite conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    they say that it is individual foreign investors who have the sole right
    to pursue claims against Canada under Chapter 11 and that this is broadly
    analogous to the historic right of individual foreign investors to sue the
    government in superior court for interference with property or contractual
    rights. In each case, the claimant is an individual who seeks a remedy against
    government.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not find this analogy apt. It is true that under Chapter 11 individual
    investors can seek to enforce state obligations to treat foreign investors
    in certain ways that the NAFTA Parties have undertaken to each other through
    the Treaty. It seems to me that these obligations are not just state-to-investor,
    but have a state-to-state dimension as well. They reflect the commitments
    of NAFTA Parties to each other as well as to individual foreign investors.
    Even if it could be said that the result is in part “rights” held by individual
    investors, they are not rights sourced in contract, legislation or domestic
    common law. They exist only so long as the NAFTA parties agree they should.
    There is no analogy here to investor rights of property or contract historically
    enforceable in the superior courts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellants argue because article 1121(1)(b) requires a foreign investor
    who seeks to utilize the Chapter 11 procedures to waive the right to seek
    damages before a domestic court with respect to the government measure in
    question, the subject matter of the dispute before the tribunal must be the
    same as that before the domestic court because if not, a waiver would not
    be required.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again,
    I do not agree. The only common factor is the government measure. However,
    the subject matter of the dispute before the NAFTA tribunal is not the government
    measure itself, but whether that measure is consistent with the international
    obligations in Chapter 11, something which historically was not within the
    purview of the superior courts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the appellants say that the enforceability of NAFTA tribunal awards in domestic
    courts shows a broad conformity with s. 96 courts. However, in my view, the
    enforceability of an award resolving such a dispute is not helpful in characterizing
    the dispute itself. Rather, enforcement is a consequential matter following
    the resolution of that dispute by the NAFTA tribunal, and not a basis for
    describing the nature of that dispute.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellants argue that NAFTA tribunals have several times reviewed the
    decisions of domestic courts of other NAFTA Parties and that this is analogous
    to the appellate powers of s. 96 courts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here
    too I do not agree. As the application judge found, there have been no cases
    in which a NAFTA tribunal has constituted itself as a court of appellate
    jurisdiction over determinations of any Canadian court. Moreover, in the
    instances cited by the appellants, the tribunals appear to assess the decisions
    of domestic courts against the state obligations found in Chapter 11 rather
    than against the standards applied by domestic appellate courts. They were
    not purporting to act as appellate courts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the end, I am confirmed in my view that the application judge correctly answered
    in the negative the historical inquiry mandated by the first step of the <i>Residential
    Tenancies</i> test. Like her, I therefore see no need to examine steps two
    and three of that test.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants go on to argue that even if NAFTA tribunals do not violate the <i>Residential
    Tenancies</i> test, nonetheless, they offend s. 96 because they remove a
    core jurisdiction from the superior courts, as discussed in <i>MacMillan</i> <i>Bloedel</i>, <i>supra</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They
    say that individual investors can use NAFTA tribunals to review governmental
    action, thereby eliminating a core function of superior courts, namely the
    judicial review of government action. The easy answer to this is that article
    1121 expressly contemplates that such investors can elect to proceed in the
    domestic courts rather than complain to a NAFTA tribunal. Thus, it cannot
    be said that there is any removal of jurisdiction from those courts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants also say that NAFTA tribunals constituted outside Canada cannot
    be judicially reviewed by s. 96 courts, thus removing that core function
    from those courts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again
    the answer is straightforward. The judicial review jurisdiction of s. 96
    courts is with respect to tribunals constituted under domestic law for alleged
    violations of domestic law. It has never been a part of the core jurisdiction
    of superior courts to review international tribunals conducted offshore and
    acting under international law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus
    I conclude that NAFTA tribunals do not violate either the <i>Residential
    Tenancies</i> test or the  <i>MacMillan Bloedel </i>test, and hence do not
    offend s. 96.</p>
  <h3><u>The Third Issue:  Do NAFTA Tribunals Violate The Principles Of Judicial
      Independence And The Rule Of Law</u>?<u></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    argument turns on the allegation that NAFTA tribunals have a supervisory
    role over domestic courts resulting in a loss of public confidence in those
    courts. I have already dealt with this argument in the context of the <i>Residential
    Tenancies </i>case, <i>supra</i>, and the answer in this context is the same.
    No NAFTA tribunal has purported to exercise an appellate jurisdiction over
    a domestic court. The appellants acknowledge that NAFTA tribunals have no <i>de
    jure</i> authority to overrule superior court decisions. Even if those tribunals
    were to assess the work of superior courts against the obligations contained
    in Chapter 11 and did so critically, I have no doubt that domestic courts
    would nonetheless retain full public confidence, just as they do in the face
    of academic or media criticism. </p>
  <p><b><u>Fourth Issue:     Do NAFTA Tribunals Violate Constitutional Values
        Such As Those Reflected In ss. 7 And 15 Of The <i>Charter Of Rights And
        Freedoms</i></u>?<u></u></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants do not argue that any particular decision of a NAFTA Tribunal
    has had this effect, but rather that the mere setting up of this decision-making
    scheme does so. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    see no basis for this argument. The appellants can point to no tribunal decision
    that impairs the constitutional or <i>Charter</i> rights of any individual
    Canadian. Indeed they do not allege that setting up the scheme has caused
    harm to anyone. They simply worry that it will. However mere speculation
    of possible harm is not enough. I therefore agree completely with the application
    judge that since any harm to anyone’s <i>Charter </i>values said to be caused
    by the creation of this scheme is merely speculative, the appellants’ complaint
    is premature.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, I would dismiss the appeal. No party sought costs and none are
    ordered.</p>
