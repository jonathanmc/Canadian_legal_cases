  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Introduction</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;&quot;\[%2\:1\:0\:\]&quot; feldmak 20060626T1554'><span
lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>      The appellants were the mortgagors of a commercial property
      located at 40 Wellesley Street East in Toronto. The respondent was the
      first mortgagee. When the appellants defaulted on the mortgage, the respondent
      put in a receiver and eventually issued a Notice of Sale Under Mortgage.
      After the respondent accepted an offer to purchase the property, the appellants
      obtained a higher offer and sought to enjoin the respondent’s sale. The
      higher offer would have paid out the subsequent encumbrances and relieved
      the appellants of further obligations. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;&quot;\[%2\:2\:0\:\]&quot; feldmak 20060626T1554'><span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>      The application judge declined to enjoin the sale. Although
      the appellants took some steps to obtain a stay pending this appeal, in
      the end they did not proceed with any motion to attempt to obtain a stay,
      and the sale ultimately closed almost ten months ago. The appellants now
      seek to set aside the judgment of the application judge.</span></p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;&quot;\[%2\:3\:0\:\]&quot; feldmak 20060626T1555'><span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>      In oral argument, counsel for the appellants stated that although
      the appellants did not agree with the application judge that the receiver
      was their agent and not the agent of the mortgagee, they did concede that
      the issue had no legal consequence for the purpose of the appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;&quot;\[%2\:4\:0\:\]&quot; feldmak 20060626T1605'><span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>      Counsel’s second submission was that the Notice of Sale was
      defective because it did not particularize the details of the receiver’s
      costs and expenses including its fees. Instead, the Notice showed a credit
      of the amount the receiver held on hand at the date of the Notice. The
      evidence was that the amount on hand was always changing as moneys were
      collected and expenses paid. The application judge concluded that the Notice
      of Sale was not defective because although the mortgagors could question
      some expenses such as the leasehold improvements or the amount of the receiver’s
      fees, these were matters that could be raised on a subsequent accounting,
      but did not affect the reasonableness of the amount claimed in the Notice
      of Sale. I see no error in this conclusion.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;&quot;\[%2\:5\:0\:\]&quot; feldmak 20060626T1558'><span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>      The appellants also challenge the continued validity of the
      Notice of Sale on the basis that while payments were made by the mortgagors
      and other amounts were received that reduced the amount owing, no new Notice
      was issued. They submit that as a result of the changes in the amount outstanding,
      at some point the Notice of Sale expired. Counsel (who was not counsel
      on the application), advised that this aspect of the challenge to the Notice
      of Sale was not raised before the application judge. In my view, there
      is no merit to the submission in this case. The application judge made
      it clear that the appellants raised none of their objections to the Notice
      of Sale until they came forward with their new purchaser, nor did they
      ever attempt to redeem the mortgage. Although there may well be circumstances
      when a Notice of Sale becomes inaccurate and misleading, in this case the
      application judge concluded that the Notice was reasonable. I would not
      interfere with that finding.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;&quot;\[%2\:6\:0\:\]&quot; feldmak 20060626T1556'><span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>      The appellants also continued to take the position that the
      receiver’s sale was improvident. The appellants point to the offer they
      obtained, which was approximately $440,000 or 11.4% higher than the one
      accepted by the receiver. They also object to the fact that the accepted
      offer contained a vendor take-back mortgage, while the offer that the appellants
      obtained was all cash.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;&quot;\[%2\:7\:0\:\]&quot; feldmak 20060626T1558'><span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>      The difficulty with the appellants’ position is that they did
      not obtain their offer until after the mortgagee had entered into a binding
      agreement of purchase and sale. The fact that the agreement allowed the
      mortgagee to extricate itself on payment of $3,000 if the mortgagor wished
      to redeem did not change the legal effect of accepting an offer and entering
      into a binding agreement. The law is stated accurately in <i>Toronto Dominion
      Bank v. Pallett Developments Ltd.</i> (1984), 47 O.R. (2d) 251, where the
      Divisional Court referred to several sources for the proposition that,
      under the relief before sale provisions of the <i>Mortgages Act </i>(now
      R.S.O. 1990 c. M. 40, s. 22(1)), a mortgagor who has defaulted can retain
      the mortgaged property by payment of the amount in default, but only before
      an agreement for sale has been entered into by the mortgagee “even where
      the agreement is said to be subject to the right of the mortgagor to redeem
      or put the mortgage into good standing” (at pp. 255-56). </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;&quot;\[%2\:8\:0\:\]&quot; feldmak 20060626T1558'><span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>      On the issue of improvidence, the offer accepted by the mortgagee
      was the best offer it had received after several months of exposing the
      property to the market. The purchase price exceeded the appraised value
      by a considerable amount, although the appraisal was admittedly dated,
      as all involved recognized that the value of the property had increased.
      Also, the mortgagee had engaged the services of a real estate agent requested
      by the mortgagors. As the application judge stated, the fact that a better
      offer was received after the mortgagee accepted an offer does not mean
      that the mortgagee acted in bad faith.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
&quot;\[%2\:9\:0\:\]&quot; feldmak 20060626T1559'><span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>      The application judge concluded with the following statement:</span></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE style='&quot;%3\:1\:255\:&quot; feldmak 20060626T1559'>It
    is my conclusion that that the appellant has failed to establish the basis
    for an injunction restraining the respondent from exercising its rights under
    the Power of Sale. The test is articulated in <i>Arnold v. Bronstein</i>,
    [1971] 1 O.R. 467 (H.C.J.) which provides that a mortgagee, acting in good
    faith and without fraud, will not be restrained from a proper exercise of
    his Power of Sale except upon tender by the mortgagor of the principal moneys
    due, interest and costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-GB>Since <i>Arnold v. Bronstein</i> was decided in 1971, the case law
      has made it clear that the mortgagor has no right to redeem by payment
      after the agreement has been entered into: <i>Logozzo v. Toronto-Dominion
      Bank</i>  (1999), 45 O.R. (3d) 737 (C.A.); <i>Toronto Dominion Bank v.
      Pallett Developments Ltd.,</i> (1984)<i> supra; Theodore Daniels Ltd. v.
      Income Trust Co. </i>(1982), 37 O.R. (2d) 316 (C.A.); <i>Mission Construction
      Ltd. v. Seel Investments Ltd.,</i> [1973] 2 O.R. 190 (H.C.J.). Therefore,
      where the mortgagee acts in good faith, it will not be restrained from
      exercising the power once it has entered into a binding agreement of purchase
      and sale. After that time, the mortgagor no longer has the right to tender
      payment.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;&quot;\[%2\:10\:0\:\]&quot; feldmak 20060626T1559'><span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Finally,
      as the sale under Notice of Sale closed pursuant to the judgment of the
      application judge and, based on the fresh evidence filed by both parties,
      the appellants did not take the appropriate steps to obtain a stay of that
      judgment before the closing although the matter of a stay was raised between
      the parties, this appeal is effectively moot. For a similar analysis involving
      the failure of an appellant to seek a stay pending appeal of a vesting
      order before it was registered under the <i>Land Titles Act. </i>See <i>Regal
      Constellation Hotel Ltd., (Re) </i>(2004), 71 O.R. (3d) 355 at paras. 28-50
      (C.A.). </span></p>

      accordance with the mortgage terms. As the amount claimed is $62,000, we
      will not fix the costs. If the parties cannot agree, the respondent may
      have them assessed.</span></p>
