      appeal involves a contest over three pieces of equipment that were located
      on the premises of RSL Canada Inc. (RSL), a company in receivership.  The
      contest is between En-Plas Inc., the supplier of the equipment, and 994814
      Ontario Inc. (the appellant), a company holding a general security agreement
      (GSA) over all of the assets and undertakings of RSL, including after acquired
      equipment.  The GSA was perfected under the <i>Personal Property Security
      Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.10 (PPSA).</span></p>

      that certain portions of the motion judge’s analysis and application of
      the PPSA are problematic, I find no basis to interfere with his findings
      of fact.  Based on those findings, I conclude that the appeal should be
      dismissed.</span></p>

      are manufactured in Japan. En-Plas imports these machines, providing technical
      services and advice for their installation and startup at the customers’ production
      facility.  In many instances, the machine is shipped directly from the

      of the machines had never previously been sold in Canada.  En-Plas had
      been advised by the Ontario Electrical Safety Authority on April 29, 2004,
      that modification to the design of these two machines (the NEX machines)
      was required before they could be approved for operation under the Ontario
      Electric Safety Code.  At the time, En-Plas thought that a solution could
      quickly be found and the requisite modifications carried out.  En-Plas
      did not, therefore, tell RSL about this issue at that time.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      July 29 2004, RSL issued a purchase order for the three machines at a cost
      of $373,000 US with ten percent down and net 180 days.  The purchase order
      also set out “[a]ll other terms and conditions per En-Plas Quote # ‘Q0019814’”.  The
      ten percent down payment was paid in early August 2004.</span></p>

      machine that En-Plas had in stock was shipped from En-Plas on August 4,
      2004 and made operational thereafter.  The other two machines were, as
      frequently occurs, shipped from Japan directly to RSL’s premises on December
      15, 2004.  They required modifications and these would be made on site.  Both
      the shipping orders and purchase order included the title retention language
      as noted above.</span></p>

      the time the motion was heard, one or two of the machines had still not
      met the electrical safety authority standards.  Accordingly, En-Plas could
      not provide the necessary safety certification for the sale and operation
      of these machines in Ontario.  En-Plas did not consider that delivery to
      RSL of the machines could occur until this condition was met.  As a result,
      RSL had not been invoiced and no debt had yet been recorded in the books.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      February 8, 2005, on application by the appellant as secured creditor of
      RSL, RSM Richter Inc. (Richter) was appointed interim receiver of RSL pursuant
      to an order of Farley J.  The registered GSA provided the appellant with
      security over inventory and equipment.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
      full payment had not been made, En-Plas initially took the position that
      it was the owner of the three machines.  En-Plas requested that the balance
      owing be paid, or that arrangements be made for the return of the machines.  The
      solicitors for the appellant responded that the secured </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
12.5pt;'>creditor had taken possession of all of the assets and that En-Plas </span><span lang=EN-US>was
      simply an unsecured creditor of RSL.  Later En-Plas advised Richter that
      it held title to the machines for reasons related to safety, and that,
      in fact, two of the machines had not yet received Electrical Safety Authority
      approval and were not operational.  By this time Richter had obtained an
      order from Ground J. approving the sale of the machines to Depco International
      Inc., a company associated with RSL.  In light of the position being taken
      by En-Plas, Richter obtained an undertaking from Depco that it would not
      resell the machines and would return them to Richter if a court determined
      that En-Plas had priority with respect to them.  On July 7, 2005, En-Plas
      moved to vary Ground J.’s order, set aside the sale of the machines and
      declare that the machines were the property of En-Plas or, in the alternative,
      conduct a trial of an issue.</span></p>

      motion judge found that the conditions of sale had not been satisfied and,
      as a result, the sale had not been completed.  The machines therefore remained
      the property of En-Plas and title had not passed.  No debt had been created
      and, because RSL was not a debtor, a security interest could not attach
      to the machines.  Thus, the PPSA regime was not yet engaged.</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant argues that the motion judge erred in his interpretation of the
      PPSA.  The fact that En-Plas had stipulated that it retained title until
      all payments were received is of no relevance.  The PPSA applies to “every
      transaction without regard to its form and without regard to the person
      who has title to the collateral that in substance creates a security interest”.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a>  Subsection
      2(a)(i) of the Act specifically provides that, it applies to conditional

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant submits that the equipment was purchased by RSL from En-Plas
      pursuant to a conditional sale agreement.  Once RSL entered into that agreement,
      the appellant acquired a security interest in that piece of equipment which
      attached pursuant to s. 11 of the PPSA.  The GSA entered into between RSL
      and the appellant had been registered and the security interest in that
      machine therefore had been perfected as required by the PPSA.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To
      obtain protection under the PPSA En-Plas would have had to perfect its
      security interest in the machine through registration.  It never did and,
      as a result, the appellant argues that it should be found to have priority.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>En-Plas
      argues that the sale was never completed and no debt was ever created.  RSL
      therefore never got possession, and the appellant could not obtain a security
      interest.  In addition, title never passed to RSL so as to bring the PPSA
      into play.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant referred the court to various passages contained in the motion
      judge’s reasons that suggest that he misconstrued or misapplied the PPSA.  Although
      there may be merit in that argument I need not address it.  The question
      is not whether the trial judge’s interpretation of the PPSA was correct
      but rather whether, based on the findings of fact, the motion judge was
      correct in concluding that the PPSA regime had not yet been engaged.  In
      my view he was.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
      is apparent from the reasons of Brook J.A. in <i>Guaranty Trust Co. of
      Canada v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce </i>(1993), 6 P.P.S.A.C. (2d)
      51 (Ont. C.A.) aff’g (1989), 2 P.P.S.A.C. (2d) 88 (Ontario H.C.), a court
      must initially determine if and when an agreement of purchase and sale
      was reached.  This is because a security interest in equipment cannot attach
      until a transaction occurs which gives the debtor rights in the equipment.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      this issue, the motion judge made important findings.  After considering
      all of the documentation exchanged between the parties and the affidavits
      and cross-examinations filed, the motion judge found:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US>[28]
      En-Plas does not show RSL as an account receivable but it does show a liability
      to RSL in relation to the deposit paid as En-Plas would be required to
      return the deposit if it was unable to complete delivery and installation.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'><span lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'><span lang=EN-US>[38] … The agreement was for a total package price for
      the delivery and installation of three Machines.  Delivery and installation
      of the Machines was not complete on the date of the Receivership, February
      8, 2005.  The NEX 6000 was not operational and the NEX 2000 had not received
      the necessary electrical and safety certification for safe and legal operation. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>[39] RSL and En-Plas had not recorded the transaction in their accounting
      records so as to create a debtor-creditor relation.  The obligation was
      still pending to RSL and RSL was still in a position to reject the goods.  En-Plas
      was not in a position to demand payment.<a href="#_ftn2"

      appellant argues that there is no basis for the motion judge’s findings
      set out above and that they constitute palpable and overriding error.  In
      particular, the appellant points out that, because En-Plas did not advise
      RSL of the electrical safety issue regarding the machines, En-Plas could
      not rely on this as delaying the completion of the delivery and installation.  I
      disagree.  The motion judge’s reasons show that he was well aware of the
      fact that En-Plas had not advised RSL of the electrical safety issues.  The
      findings I have quoted are fully supported by the record, including the
      language of the documentation, the nature of the property in issue, En-Plas’ obligation
      to obtain electrical certification and make the machines operational, as
      well as the fact that the books and records of RSL and En-Plas are consistent
      with the machines being entirely the property of En-Plas at the relevant
      time.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although
      the motion judge did not put it this way, I take his findings quoted above,
      when read in the context of the balance of his reasons, to mean that on
      the particular facts of this case, RSL had not yet acquired an interest
      in the machines.  The documentation exchanged between the parties did not
      give RSL rights in the equipment to which the appellant’s GSA could attach.  RSL
      acquired nothing until the machines were
    “Electrical Safety Approved” and En-Plas had made them operational.  Since
    this never occurred, RSL never became a debtor and never acquired any rights
    in the three machines, a prerequisite for the creation of a security interest.</span></p>
