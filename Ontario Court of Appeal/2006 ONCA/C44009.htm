  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment of Justice
    Roydon J. Kealey of the Superior Court of Justice, dated July 8, 2005</span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>.</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While a student at the Faculty of Law of the University of
    Ottawa, the appellant commenced an action for damages against three female
    classmates, the then Dean of Law and the University, alleging defamation as
    against his classmates and slander and negligence as against the Dean and the
    University.  The appellant’s claims
    arose from concerns expressed to the Dean regarding the appellant’s social
    invitations to one or more of the defendant law students and the response of
    the Dean and the University to the concerns expressed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By the time of trial, the appellant’s action had been
    discontinued as against two of his classmates.  The appellant alleged that his third classmate went to the Dean and
    accused the appellant of sexually harassing her and that she repeated this
    allegation to law students and others.  The appellant claimed that the Dean made a finding of sexual harassment
    against him without investigating the matter and instructed the Vice-Dean of
    the Law School to confront the appellant, knowing that this would inflict harm
    on the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By judgment dated July 8, 2005, Kealey J. of the Superior
    Court of Justice dismissed the appellant’s action in its entirety.  The appellant appeals from that dismissal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is one issue.  As
    framed in his supplementary notice of appeal dated February 15, 2006, the
    appellant asserts that the trial judge’s reasons “demonstrate a reasonable
    apprehension of bias in respect of his assessment of the [appellant’s]
    credibility based on a perceived stereotype of the [appellant] as suffering
    from a mental illness/disability.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree.  In our
    view, the trial judge’s reasons do not reflect the bias alleged by the
    appellant and the dismissal of the appellant’s action was amply supported by
    the evidence.  We say this for several
    reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s case on appeal is predicated on the
    proposition that the trial judge made a factual finding that the appellant
    suffered from a mental illness associated with psychosis or delusions and that
    this finding was based on impermissible stereotypical reasoning that tainted
    the trial judge’s assessment of the appellant’s credibility.  In our opinion, this argument misconstrues
    the trial judge’s reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant relies principally on a passage from the reasons
    in which the trial judge commented upon the appellant’s response to the events
    in question by using language that in part referenced the appellant’s state of
    mind or mental condition.  In our
    opinion, viewed in the context of the trial judge’s reasons as a whole, it is
    clear that these comments by the trial judge did not constitute a finding that
    the appellant suffered from a mental illness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is significant in this regard that, in addition to the
    challenged passage, the trial judge later noted in his reasons the evidence at
    trial that in his interactions with the Dean and other University personnel in
    response to the incident, the appellant was described as “calm and contained”
    and “strong, aggressive and assertive” with “nothing unusual noted”.  Thus, both in this part of his reasons and
    in the impugned passage from the reasons, the trial judge was simply providing
    descriptors of the appellant’s conduct in reacting to the concerns expressed to
    the Dean.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, and importantly, to the extent that the complained
    of comments by the trial judge could be read as dealing with features of the
    appellant’s mental health, it is our view that the appellant himself put his
    mental health in issue because his pleading includes an assertion that is
    tantamount to an allegation of negligent infliction of mental harm.  In addition, the appellant led evidence at
    trial during his own examination-in-chief concerning his mental health prior to
    his admission to law school and as a result of the events in question.  Thus, by virtue of the causes of action that
    the appellant advanced and the evidence that he adduced at trial, the
    appellant’s metal health and the effect of the respondents’ actions on that
    mental health were live issues at trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the trial judge articulated numerous reasons for
    disbelieving the appellant’s evidence.  The trial judge’s detailed evaluation of the appellant’s credibility
    included the identification of specific factors grounding his rejection of the
    appellant’s evidence and his adverse credibility findings against him.  This credibility assessment contains no
    suggestion that the trial judge prejudged the appellant’s case or his
    credibility or that his mind was closed to the appellant’s claims.  To the contrary, in our opinion, the trial
    judge’s reasons indicate that he assessed the appellant’s allegations and his
    credibility on the merits, in the context of all the evidence led at trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, the trial produced an outcome unfavourable to the
    appellant.  This does not mean that the
    trial judge was biased against him or that he chose to disbelieve the appellant
    based on prohibited stereotypical reasoning.  The appellant has failed to discharge his heavy burden of establishing a
    reasonable apprehension of bias.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is dismissed.  The respondents are entitled to their costs of the appeal, if sought, on
    the partial indemnity scale, fixed in the total amount of $5000, inclusive of
    disbursements and Goods and Services Tax, to be paid by the appellant within
    six months from the date of this decision.</p>
