style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant is a barrister and solicitor who was called to the bar in 1982.
    At trial, the respondents obtained a significant award of damages against
    the appellant’s clients. The trial judge subsequently awarded costs of the
    litigation to the respondents on a substantial indemnity basis. He also ordered
    that the appellant be jointly and severally liable with his clients for those
    costs because he found that the appellant’s relationship with his clients
    placed him in conflict of interest with them and with his duty to the court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue in this appeal is whether the costs order against the appellant can
    be sustained. For the reasons that follow, I conclude that it cannot. I would
    therefore allow the appeal.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'><u>FACTS</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    underlying litigation concerned two agreements: a franchise agreement between
    the respondents as franchisee, and 3 Pizzas 3 Wings Ltd. (“3P3”) as franchisor;
    and a sublease between the respondents as tenant, and Triple 3 Holdings Inc.
    (“Triple 3”) as sublessor. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    September 29, 2001, 3P3 and Triple 3 terminated the respondents’ franchise
    agreement and sublease and then sued the respondents for breach of both agreements.
    The respondents counterclaimed against them and a third related company,
    3 for 1 Pizza &amp; Wings (Canada) Inc. (“3 for 1”), and the two principals
    of all three companies, claiming fraudulent termination of both agreements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    an eight-day trial, the trial judge dismissed the claim and allowed the counterclaim.
    He found that the actions taken against the respondents by the defendants
    to the counterclaim were abusive, high-handed and fraudulent. He pierced
    the corporate veil, found all five defendants to the counterclaim liable,
    and awarded the respondents $244,457.00 in damages and an additional $350,000.00
    in punitive damages. The appeal from this judgment was dismissed for failure
    to post security for costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nine
    months later, after receiving written and oral submissions, the trial judge
    made his costs award. He found that the conduct of the defendants to the
    counterclaim justified costs on a substantial indemnity basis. He found the
    sum claimed by the respondents to be fair and reasonable and fixed the amount
    of costs at $140,000.00, including approximately $22,500.00 for the costs
    of the costs motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents also sought costs personally against the appellant. They based
    their claim primarily on rule 57.07(1) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>,
    R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, which reads:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    may make an order,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the costs motion, the trial judge did not call on counsel for the appellant
    to respond to the argument that the appellant was responsible for the obstructionist
    tactics of his clients at discovery. Nor is there any suggestion in his reasons
    that the appellant was otherwise responsible for any wasted costs or for
    costs otherwise incurred without reasonable cause in the litigation. Moreover,
    the trial judge does not suggest that the appellant was in any way a participant
    in the actions of his clients which were found to be fraudulent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did call on the appellant to respond to the allegation that he
    was personally liable for the costs of the proceedings due to a fundamental
    conflict of interest between himself, his clients and his duty to the court.
    The trial judge’s conclusion on this issue is set out at paras. 11 and 13
    of his reasons as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            Mr.
    Chidley-Hill acted as counsel and vice president for the defendants, who
    acted in common, at the time that the abusive transactions complained of
    in this proceeding occurred, and as counsel at trial. He shared a common
    financial interest at that time with the defendants. He could not have been
    acting in an independent position when he stood to gain from his clients’ wrongdoing
    as it occurred, and while he was obliged to advise them as to their legal
    responsibilities. He had placed himself in conflict with his duty to the
    Court and to his clients, as he was unable to advise the clients as to their
    exposure to liability in this case, and the advantage of settling it, without
    admitting his own. Rule 57.07(1) provides, “where a solicitor for a party
    has caused costs to be incurred without reasonable cause or to be  wasted
    by undue delay, negligence or other default, the court may make an order,
    (c) requiring the solicitor personally to pay the costs of any party”.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            It
    was submitted on behalf of Mr. Chidley-Hill that he believed that his clients
    had an arguable case, and that it was not his role to judge their cause.
    This would have been a complete defence had Mr. Chidley-Hill maintained the
    position of independent counsel. It is not a valid defence for a lawyer who
    has a financial interest in his clients’ wrongdoing, was closely allied with
    his client as an executive officer while the wrongful acts were committed,
    who had the responsibility to give appropriate legal advice to the client
    at the time that the wrongful acts occurred and who represented the client
    as counsel at trial, where those wrongful acts were in issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, the trial judge found the appellant jointly and severally liable
    with his clients for the costs of the proceedings, which he had fixed at
    $140,000.00.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    facts before the trial judge concerning the appellant’s relationship with
    his clients were straightforward. The appellant signed an employment agreement
    with 3 for 1 on July 13, 2001. By its terms, the agreement was to be effective
    upon his inclusion under a standard directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
    policy. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was to be employed in his professional capacity, with the title “Vice
    President and General Counsel”, in relation to 3 for 1 and its business.
    He was to perform the duties of corporate counsel, including representing
    3 for 1 and its related companies in litigation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was to be paid an annual salary of $160,000.00. As well, he was
    entitled to 1% of the money received by 3 for 1 from the purchase and sale
    of its corporate stores, and 10% of all transfer fees received by 3 for 1
    when an existing franchisee sold its franchise to a new franchisee. When
    the franchisor 3P3 terminated the respondents’ franchise and then sold it,
    the appellant received no payment from 3 for 1 under either of these provisions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the respondents were aware early in the litigation that the appellant held
    himself out as Vice President of 3 for 1, they did not know the precise terms
    of his employment with 3 for 1 set out above until the costs motion. Moreover,
    although he acted as their counsel in litigation, the appellant had no office
    or employment with 3P3 or Triple 3.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'><u>ANALYSIS</u> </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    possible basis for the order under appeal can quickly be disposed of. The
    trial judge appears to have relied in part on rule 57.07(1), although there
    is no finding that the appellant caused costs to be incurred without reasonable
    cause or  wasted by undue delay, negligence or other default. Indeed, the
    trial judge did not focus at all on the way the appellant conducted the litigation.
    Rather, he relied on the nature of the appellant’s relationship with his
    clients. Given the absence of a finding of wasted or unreasonable costs,
    rule 57.07(1) cannot be used to support this costs order.  The respondents
    candidly conceded as much in this court. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    only other possible jurisdictional basis for the trial judge’s costs order
    is the court’s general power to determine by whom costs shall be paid under
    s. 131 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C-43. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Acting
    under that section, the trial judge focused on the appellant’s relationship
    with his clients. The trial judge found that the appellant shared a common
    financial interest with them namely that he stood to gain from their actions
    which the trial judge found to be unlawful. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the finding of a common financial interest is palpably wrong. While
    the trial judge does not explain how this common interest could arise, the
    only possible source is the pair of provisions in the appellant’s employment
    agreement entitling him to 1% of the money received by 3 for 1 from the purchase
    and sale of its corporate stores, and 10% of all transfer fees received by
    3 for 1 where an existing franchisee sells its franchise to a new franchisee. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are three reasons why these provisions cannot support the finding of the
    trial judge. First, 3 for 1 had not included the appellant under a standard
    directors’ and operators’ liability insurance policy. By the terms of the
    appellant’s employment agreement that insurance was necessary to make the
    agreement effective. Second, even if the agreement had been effective, 3P3,
    not 3 for 1, was the respondent’s franchisor. The appellant had no contractual
    relationship with 3P3. The terms of his employment agreement by which he
    stood to profit from the sale of a store or a transfer of an existing franchise
    applied only when 3 for 1 was the franchisor. Third, even if the three related
    companies could be treated as one for the purposes of the appellant’s contractual
    entitlement the respondents’ franchise was not a 3 for 1 corporate store
    nor was this a sale by them to a new franchisee. The appellant therefore
    had no contractual right from which he stood to gain as a result of his clients’ actions
    against the respondents. Vindication of his clients would not trigger a financial
    benefit for him under his employment contract.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    even if the appellant had such a contractual right, I do not think he would
    thereby put himself in a position of conflict with his duty to his clients
    or his duty to the court. Thus, even on the assumption of a common financial
    interest with his clients, the costs order against the appellant cannot stand. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    issue must be considered against the backdrop of the well-known general admonition
    that courts must be extremely cautious in awarding costs personally against
    a lawyer. This reflects the lawyer’s duty of confidentiality and the professional
    obligation to advance the client’s case to the best of the lawyer’s ability.
    The lawyer should not be placed in a position where fear of an adverse costs
    order may conflict with those duties. See <i>Young  v. Young</i>,<i> </i> [1993]
    4 S.C.R. 3  at 136.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    turn first to the possibility of the appellant being in conflict with his
    duty to his client. Assuming that the appellant’s contract would entitle
    him to a payment if his client’s actions against the respondents were sustained
    as lawful in the litigation, his interest in the outcome of the litigation
    would be coincident with, not in conflict with, that of his clients. While
    such a payment would not be related to the amount of time he spent on the
    litigation or the quality of the legal services provided, there is no reason
    to suspect that an economic incentive like this would tempt a lawyer to conduct
    the litigation to further his own best interest rather than that of the client.
    This court said as much in <i>McIntyre Estate v. Ontario (Attorney General) </i>(2002),
    61 O.R. (3d) 257 at paras. 52 and&nbsp;53 in the context of contingency fee
    agreements. In other words, having a common financial interest would not
    place the appellant in conflict with his duty to provide his clients with
    objective professional advice provided the client was aware of the lawyer’s
    interest. In this case, since the common interest derives from the appellant’s
    employment agreement and would therefore be disclosed to his clients, it
    could not be said that the appellant was in breach of his professional duty
    of candour to his clients.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    therefore conclude that even if the appellant shared this common financial
    interest with his clients he would not be in conflict with his duty to them.
    This foundation for the order appealed from therefore falls away.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    reach the same conclusion in respect of the appellant’s duty to the court.
    There is clearly nothing wrong with an employed lawyer representing his or
    her employer in litigation. The trial judge did not rely on the appellant’s
    employment status to find him in breach of his duty to the court. It was
    the addition of the common financial interest the appellant shared with his
    clients that caused the trial judge to find that the appellant was in breach
    of his duty to the court. </p>

    disagree with this conclusion as well. The existence of the economic incentive
    found by the trial judge is, in my view, no different from that accompanying
    many contingency fee or class action fee arrangements. In such cases, if
    counsel succeeds in the litigation, fair and reasonable remuneration need
    not simply reflect the time spent or the quality of the legal services provided.
    There is no suggestion today that these contingency fee or class action fee
    arrangements place the lawyer in a position of conflict with his or her duty
    to the court, and I do not think that such a suggestion can arise from the
    common economic interest found by the trial judge here. Something more, such
    as counsel’s unprofessional conduct of the litigation, (which did not occur
    here), would be necessary before counsel could be found in breach of his
    or her duty to the court. </p>

    the duty to treat the court with candour, fairness, courtesy and respect
    imposed by the <i>Rules of Professional Conduct</i> of the Law Society of
    Upper Canada focuses on the lawyer’s conduct of the litigation rather than
    the economic relationship between lawyer and client. In my view, it cannot
    be said that simply by conducting this litigation while having this economic
    relationship with his clients the appellant was in breach of that rule.</p>

    therefore conclude that even if the appellant had shared this common financial
    interest with his clients, it would not place him in a conflict with his
    duty to the court. </p>

    reasons that could underpin the order appealed from therefore are fatally
    flawed. I would thus allow the appeal, set aside the costs order against
    the appellant and dismiss the motion seeking costs from him. The appellant
    is entitled to his costs in this court and in the court below, both on a
    partial indemnity basis, fixed at $7,500.00 in each case, inclusive of disbursements
    and G.S.T</p>
