  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    first instance, Pitt J. granted the request, deciding that neither the Canadian
    government’s policy concerns with the underlying American litigation nor
    the burden placed on the appellant by the request were sufficient to warrant
    its rejection. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal. I agree that Canadian
    public policy does not bar the request. However, the request is framed in
    terms so broad and general that the record cannot sustain a finding that
    what is sought could reasonably be relevant or necessary to the issues in
    the litigation or could not otherwise be obtained. The request as framed
    should therefore be rejected. </p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'><u>THE BACKGROUND</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    request for international judicial assistance arises out of a civil action
    in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
    brought by the respondents against a Canadian company, Talisman Energy Inc.
    (“Talisman”). Although the respondents sought to turn it into a class action,
    certification has been denied. It continues to be pursued as an action brought
    by the named respondents. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents are all residents or former residents of Sudan who claim to have
    been seriously harmed by acts of genocide, enslavement, torture, rape and
    other human rights violations by the government of Sudan, aided and abetted
    by Talisman because of its interest in Sudanese oil. While Talisman has defended,
    the government of Sudan has not appeared in the action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    action is brought pursuant to the <i>Alien Tort Claims Act</i> (28 U.S.C. §1350
    (2000)), American legislation passed in 1789 by the first Congress of the
    United States. It is a single sentence and reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The district
    court shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for
    a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of
    the United States.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    litigation was commenced on November 8, 2001. Talisman made two challenges
    to the jurisdiction of the US District Court, both of which were denied in
    orders dated March 2003 and August 2004. The plaintiffs’ request for certification
    as a class action was refused in March 2005. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    January 2005 Canada delivered a diplomatic note to the United States in respect
    of the action. The note expressed two fundamental concerns:  first, Canada’s
    opposition in principle to broad assertions of extra territorial jurisdiction
    over Canadian individuals and entities arising out of activities that take
    place entirely outside of the state asserting jurisdiction; and second, Canada’s
    concern that its efforts to use trade incentives for Canadian exporters to
    encourage peaceful solutions in Sudan will be rendered impotent by the litigation,
    because Canadian firms will likely absent themselves from Sudan altogether,
    out of fear of proceedings in American courts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    discovery process in the American action has been ongoing since December
    2002, and has been managed by Cote J. of the Southern District Court of New
    York. The respondents have examined a number of employees or contractors
    of Talisman and received production of thousands of documents, numbering
    some 837,477 pages. A number of the individuals who have been deposed were
    at one stage employed by or through Talisman (Greater Nile) B.V., the Dutch
    subsidiary of Talisman through which it owned its interest in the actual
    operating company in Sudan. Except for several foreign discoveries, including
    the one in issue here, the discovery process has been concluded.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is the respondents’ desire to examine the appellant as part of this discovery
    process that lead to the request for international judicial assistance. Mr.
    Rybiak is the former manager of Human Resources and Administration for Talisman
    (Greater Nile) B.V. in Sudan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    notice to Talisman, but not to Mr. Rybiak, the respondents moved to have
    Cote&nbsp;J. issue the request to the Ontario Superior Court for international
    judicial assistance. They sought both oral and documentary evidence from
    Mr. Rybiak regarding subjects which they specified as follows: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>            -            Talisman’s operations in Sudan; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>            -            Talisman’s security strategy in Sudan; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;

    in Sudan;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>            -            Talisman’s co-operation and co-ordination with the
    government of Sudan;                                and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>            -           Talisman’s knowledge of statements
    concerning human rights violations in Sudan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>While there was no affidavit evidence before Cote J. the respondents represented
    to her that the evidence sought is relevant to matters in issue in the pending
    litigation, that the documents are likely to be in Mr. Rybiak’s possession,
    that the evidence sought is necessary for trial and not otherwise obtainable,
    that it is not contrary to public policy and is not unduly burdensome to
    the witness. The motion was unopposed. Judge Cote accepted the representations
    and issued the request on January 19, 2005. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant
    to s. 60 of the <i>Ontario Evidence Act</i>,<i> </i>R.S.O. 1990, c. E 26
    and ss. 46 and 47 of the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C.5.,
    the respondents applied to the Ontario Superior Court for an order granting
    the request and ordering Mr. Rybiak to produce documents and attend to be
    examined. He opposed the application. Talisman, pursuant to a direction from
    Cote J., appeared as interveners but took no position as to whether the request
    should be enforced, a position they maintained in this court. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    only affidavit filed in the Superior Court in support of the application
    is that of New York counsel stating his belief that the evidence sought is
    relevant, necessary for trial, and not otherwise obtainable. The only basis
    for these assertions is the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Richard Rybiak
    is the former Manager of Human Resources and Administration for Talisman
    (Greater Nile) B.V., in the Republic of the Sudan. At all material times,
    Talisman (Greater Nile) B.V. was a subsidiary of Talisman. In this capacity,
    Richard Rybiak was uniquely positioned to observe Talisman’s interaction
    with the [Government of Sudan], as well as operations in the Sudan. The area
    in which Mr. Rybiak has knowledge, include, but is not limited to, the following
    (a) Talisman (Greater Nile) B.V. management meetings which involved discussions
    concerning oil exploration in the class area; (b) discussions relating to
    security and the use of the Military in Sudan in connection with oil exploration;
    (c) corporate decisions relating to responsibility reports concerning Sudan;
    (d) community development in Sudan and (e) retention and recovery of corporate
    records and documents from Sudan and (f) specific knowledge of persons who
    worked in Sudan for Talisman (Greater Nile) B.V. or Talisman. We have obtained
    through discovery thousands of documents which names or refers to Mr. Rybiak
    and demonstrates his knowledge of the above subjects, all of which are of
    direct relevance to the claims in this U.S. action.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Moreover, I
    believe that the evidence sought through the Commission is not otherwise
    obtainable. Respondent’s possession and participation in events provided
    him with unique knowledge of Talisman’s interaction with the  [Government
    of Sudan], as well as Talisman’s operations in the Sudan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge granted the request on July 29, 2005. He concluded that
    the request was not contrary to Canadian public policy. At para. 43 of his
    reasons he said this:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It is my view
    that, while the Canadian government’s concern as to the American court’s
    jurisdiction is well-founded and an important consideration, it is not sufficient,
    and was likely not intended to override the principles of comity, and the
    applicants’ right to the evidence to conduct a fair trial. The compliance
    with the request for documents and answers to questions that are useful for
    the case is not contrary to the public policy of Canada.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    then turned to the prejudicial impact of the request on the appellant. His
    reasons for concluding that this consideration should not bar the request
    are as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[45]            I
    do not share the view of the respondent that the request is so overly broad
    as to unduly burden Rybiak such that it is an affront to Canadian sovereignty.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[46]            The
    main action is extraordinary. In many respects, it breaks new ground. The
    process will likely present difficulties to Mr. Rybiak. He will perhaps not
    be in a position to provide all the information required, whether oral or
    documentary. Nevertheless, I believe the factors set out by Osborne J. in <i>Friction
    Division Products Inc. v. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. (No. 2)</i> (1986),
    56 O.R. (2d) 722 (H.C.J.) and under rule 30.10 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure </i>as
    set out by Blair J. in <i>Fecht v. Deloitte &amp; Touche</i> (1996), 28 O.R.
    (3d) 188 (Gen. Div.) aff’d (1997) 32 O.R. (3d) 417 (C.A.) support a granting
    of the request.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[47]            It
    does not appear from the materials before me that, for example, the applicants
    have deposed any other persons from the Sudanese subsidiary, Talisman (Greater
    Nile) B.V. In contrast to <i>Fecht</i>, <i>supra</i>, the documents requested
    are relevant and sufficiently connected to the issues in the main action.
    The production of documents may be inconvenient, but is not so burdensome
    as to outweigh the compelling reasons for permitting the examination and
    production to proceed. The respondent, Rybiak, had counsel for these proceedings
    and will undoubtedly have counsel present at the time of the discoveries.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'><u>ANALYSIS</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jurisprudential principles that must inform the analysis in this matter are
    well known and not in dispute. It is their application that is in issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    basic principle is set out in the oft-quoted words of Dickson J. (as he then
    was) speaking for the court in <i>R. v. Zingre</i>,<i> </i>[1981] 2 S.C.R.
    392 at p. 401:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It is upon this
    comity of nations that international legal assistance rests. Thus the courts
    of one jurisdiction will give effect to the laws and judicial decisions of
    another jurisdiction, not as a matter of obligation but out of mutual deference
    and respect. A foreign request is given full force and effect unless it be
    contrary to the public policy of the jurisdiction to which the request is
    directed (see <i>Gulf Oil Corporation v. Gulf Canada Ltd. et al.</i>, [1980]
    2 S.C.R. 39) or otherwise prejudicial to the sovereignty or the citizens
    of the latter jurisdiction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the same case, Dickson J. signalled that a foreign request should not be
    rejected solely because it relates to a pre-trial proceeding. However, that
    fact can be considered where, for example, the foreign discovery process
    is much broader than in Canada as is the case in the United States (see <i>Zingre,
    supra</i>, at p. 402).</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    these principles in mind, I turn to the three ways in which the appellant
    argues that the application judge erred. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    he argues that giving effect to the foreign request would be contrary to
    the public policy of Canada as expressed in the diplomatic note of January
    2005.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree. The question is whether granting the request to obtain evidence
    for the foreign trial contravenes Canada’s public policy. The focus on the
    request, rather than the underlying foreign litigation, is made clear in
    the passage in <i>Zingre</i> quoted above. <i>Re Westinghouse Electric Corporation
    and Duquesne Light Co. </i>(1977), 16 O.R. (2d) 273 (H.C.) reflects this
    approach as well. There it was the disclosure of the information sought,
    not the underlying nature of the foreign litigation, that constituted the
    fatal violation of Canadian public policy. In this case, Canada’s diplomatic
    note says nothing about the request for judicial assistance. The concerns
    it expresses are with respect to the underlying litigation. Those concerns
    will remain whether or not the request is enforced because the litigation
    appears to be proceeding regardless of  whether the request is granted. In
    short, the diplomatic note expresses no concerns about the request for international
    judicial assistance, but does express concerns that remain undiminished whatever
    the fate of the request.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the diplomatic note does not go so far as to say that if the American court
    determines that it has jurisdiction it would nonetheless contravene Canada’s
    public policy for Canadian courts to accept that jurisdiction for the purposes
    of deciding upon the request for judicial assistance. To do so, the note
    would have to go beyond the concerns expressed about the litigation itself
    and consider as well the important principle of international comity. In
    this case that would include the facts relevant to that principle, such as
    the fact that Talisman has appeared in the American litigation and is defending
    it. The diplomatic note simply does address these issues.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    therefore agree with the application judge that enforcing the foreign request
    does not contravene the public policy of Canada. The diplomatic note cannot
    be read as a statement of public policy requiring its dismissal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellant argues that the application judge erred in failing to consider
    that the American court refused to certify the action as a class action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again,
    I disagree. While the action was commenced as a putative class action, it
    remained an action brought by named parties that required certification before
    it could be treated as a class action. That did not happen, and the action
    continues as one brought by named individuals. The application judge properly
    considered the request on that basis, not as one emanating from a class action.
    Moreover, none of the materials supporting the request depend upon certification
    for their relevance. Matters such as the appellant’s former position, the
    alleged uniqueness of his knowledge, the relevance of the evidence sought
    and its necessity for litigation and whether it was otherwise obtainable
    are not affected by whether the action has been certified or is continuing
    as one brought by named individuals. I would not give effect to this ground
    of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s third argument is that there is not enough in the record to meet
    the criteria set out in <i>Fecht, supra,</i> for such a broadly framed request.
    In particular, the appellant says that the criteria of relevance, necessity
    and the evidence not being otherwise obtainable are not established.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with this submission. The application judge’s consideration of the <i>Fecht</i> criteria
    focuses very largely on whether the order sought would be unduly burdensome
    for the appellant. While he found the relevance criterion to be satisfied
    for the documents requested, he did so without explanation. And he did not
    address at all whether, apart from the documents, the evidence requested
    can be said to be relevant to the issues in the litigation. Moreover, there
    is no assessment  whatsoever of whether the evidence sought from the appellant
    is necessary or otherwise obtainable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the failure to meaningfully address these criteria constitutes an
    error in principle. In these circumstances it is fatal to the exercise of
    his discretion and leaves to this court the determination of whether the
    respondents have established that these criteria are met.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    importance of these criteria is perhaps obvious. Without some showing of
    relevance, the court may be sanctioning a fishing expedition and requiring
    one of its citizens to participate in a process that may be of no assistance
    to the foreign litigation. The need to establish necessity serves much the
    same purpose, but is also closely related to the requirement that the evidence
    sought not be otherwise obtainable. Blair J. described the importance of
    the latter this way in <i>Fecht</i>, <i>supra</i>, at pp. 204-05:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The requirement
    that the evidence not be otherwise obtainable is to protect the target examinee
    from having to assume an unfair burden in the process, by identifying more
    precisely, and narrowing, what it is necessary to pursue in the letters rogatory
    exercise. In this way the non-party which is sought to be examined is shielded
    to the extent possible from what the Court of Appeal referred to in <i>Ontario
    (Attorney General) v. Starvo</i> (1995), 26 O.R.(3d) 39 at pp. 47-48, as “the
    potentially intrusive, costly and time-consuming process of discovery and
    production”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
    then does the record disclose? The request was issued following an unopposed
    motion in which the American court was provided only with the representations
    of counsel. The request simply recites that the American court accepts these
    representations. It is clear that an Ontario court is not bound to accept
    the language of the foreign request as the final say, but is entitled to
    go behind it to examine precisely what it is the foreign court is seeking
    to do. The Ontario court is to give effect to the request only if the requirements
    of Ontario law are met. See <i>Fecht</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 195. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Beyond
    the request itself, the only additional material is the affidavit of New
    York counsel. It is also quite unhelpful. Counsel states his belief that
    the evidence sought from the appellant is relevant to the matters in issue
    in litigation, that it is necessary and not otherwise obtainable. All that
    is offered in support of these bald assertions is the management position
    occupied by the appellant, his participation in unspecified events and certain
    particular areas of knowledge that are attributed to him and those areas
    clearly fall short of the full range of evidence sought herein.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    assessing whether the respondents have met the relevance consideration, it
    is helpful to reiterate the broad issue in the American litigation: whether
    Talisman aided and abetted the government of Sudan to commit acts of genocide,
    war crimes, forced displacements and other human rights violations in order
    to enhance its oil activities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    request seeks the appellant’s evidence in terms so wide that they go well
    beyond this. The most extreme example is the request for the appellant’s
    information regarding “Talisman’s operations in Sudan”. Granting a request
    in these broad and general terms would risk requiring the appellant to answer
    questions that extend to aspects of Talisman’s operations that have nothing
    to do with the issues in the litigation. While the appellant undoubtedly
    has information about Talisman’s operations in Sudan, there is nothing to
    show that any of that information is relevant to the issues in the American
    litigation. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    makes this case quite different from the recent decision of this court in <i>Ontario
    Service Employees Union Pension Trust Fund and Clark </i>released June 21,
    2006. While the request was framed broadly there, it was conceded that the
    targeted deponent had some information within the broadly framed request
    that was relevant to the issues in the foreign litigation. Here that is neither
    conceded nor established.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    recognize that the foreign request is made at the pre-trial stage of the
    litigation by litigants who are on the outside of Talisman’s operations looking
    in. Nonetheless, I do not think that this request can meet the relevance
    requirement simply by employing such sweeping language, in the hope that
    within the range of information described the deponent may be discovered
    to know something of relevance for the litigation. I think the request must
    be more targeted than that.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      Church of Sudan v. Talisman Energy Inc.</i>, [2005] A.J. No.1808  (Q.B.)
      LoVecchio J. reached essentially the same conclusion in circumstances almost
      identical to these. In that case, the plaintiffs  (the respondents in our
      case), requested the Alberta court to give effect to a request for international
      judicial assistance issued by Cote J. in the same American litigation. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    request to the Alberta court sought to obtain the evidence of Edward Bogle
    and two other senior officers of Talisman. Mr. Bogle is the former executive
    vice president of exploration for Talisman. The evidence sought from him
    was described in precisely the same general terms as are used in the request
    in this case. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice
    LoVecchio concluded that the request was essentially an open-ended one for
    the purposes of discovery. Since it was without any limits on the scope of
    examination, he found, at para. 13  that it was really a “fishing expedition”,
    and indicated that if the request was not made more specific he would likely
    dismiss the application. As a result, a revised request was obtained from
    Cote J. that sought evidence from Mr.&nbsp;Bogle in considerably more specific
    terms, on fifteen discrete specific topics. Even with a more targeted request,
    LoVecchio J. ordered that only four of these topics could be put to Mr. Bogle
    as the material before him did not demonstrate that the information sought
    on the other eleven was relevant or necessary for trial.<i></i></p>

line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning
    to whether the evidence sought from the appellant is otherwise obtainable
    or necessary (in the sense that he alone possesses it), here too the respondents
    fall short. The request itself does no more than recite the American court’s
    acceptance of counsels’ representations to that effect. The only other material
    the respondents can look to is the affidavit of New York counsel. While it
    sets out six areas of knowledge that the appellant has, it does not claim
    that he alone has that information. Indeed, that would seem unlikely given
    the nature of the areas specified, which include, for example, knowledge
    of Talisman (Greater Nile) G.V. management meetings involving discussions
    concerning oil exploration in areas of Sudan. The appellant would not have
    been the only one to attend those meetings.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    only other assertion in the affidavit of possible help to the respondents
    is that the appellant’s position and “participation in events” provided him
    with unique knowledge of Talisman’s interaction with the Government of Sudan
    as well as Talisman’s operations in Sudan. No events are specified nor is
    there anything to suggest why the appellant might be the only participant
    available to give evidence about them. There is no suggestion of how his
    position gave him unique knowledge of Talisman’s interaction with the Government
    of Sudan and its operations in Sudan. The position itself, Manager of Human
    Resources and Administration for the Talisman subsidiary, would seem to make
    that unlikely. It is not as if he were the Manager of Government Affairs
    for the subsidiary, or, even better, for Talisman itself.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    record discloses that by the date of the application the respondents had
    already deposed twenty-one executives of Talisman including one who was the
    Manager of Corporate Responsibility and Government Affairs for Talisman itself.
    While the record before the application judge did not indicate one way or
    the other, there is now no dispute that several of those twenty-one executives
    worked for Talisman (Greater Nile) B.V., as did Mr. Rybiak. There is nothing
    to suggest why it might be that the appellant has information about the issues
    in the American litigation and these other executives do not. Nor does the
    affidavit suggest that there are any aspects of those issues about which
    that might be said.<i></i></p>
