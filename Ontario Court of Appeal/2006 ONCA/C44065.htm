    the cooperation of the Superior Court of Justice in Ontario in compelling
    the production of a wide range of documentation from Deloitte, as well as
    the <i>viva voce</i> examination of Richard Clark and Mark Wayland.  Mr.
    Clark was the lead audit partner with Deloitte and Mr. Wayland was the audit

    alleged that when Nortel subsequently disclosed its true financial condition,
    the value of its shares declined substantially and OPT suffered significant
    losses.  OPT states that Nortel caused its public statements to be false
    or misleading by the deliberate use of five improper financial reporting
    and accounting practices in relation to its third and fourth quarters of
    2000, namely:</p>

    audited Nortel’s year-end financial statements and reviewed its quarterly
    financial statements in the years 2000 and following.  On December 23, 2003,
    Nortel issued a restatement of its financial statements for 2000, 2001, 2002
    and certain quarters of 2003 (“the 2002 Restatement”).  Later, in January

    with the demand for the Requested Documents will entail considerable time
    and effort, and expense, by Deloitte.  Their affiant, Mr. Morrison, deposed
    that the requested documents number in the hundreds of thousands of pages,
    and possibly exceed a million pages.  The documents are both in hardcopy
    and electronic form and are stored at various locations.  Those relating
    to the 2000 and 2001 financial statements include over 400 working paper
    files, consisting mostly of documents in electronic form.  Deloitte generates
    and stores documents in electronic form using a software program (Audit System
    2), which does not allow text searching across multiple documents or records.  Users
    must open documents individually before examining and/or printing them.  The
    requested documents also include more than a hundred thousand pages of personal
    desk files that are not organised by subject matter.  Mr. Morrison estimated
    a minimum of fifteen hundred person-hours by Deloitte to conduct a file-by-file
    and document-by-document review for the purpose of identifying and segregating
    the relevant documents from the irrelevant materials.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>(a) that the documents and evidence produced pursuant to the
    judgment enforcing the letters rogatory would be used only for the purposes

    and/or Clark or Wayland as a party defendant to that action, or (ii) commencing
    any new proceedings against Deloitte and/or Clark or Wayland, or (iii) otherwise
    advancing any new claim against Deloitte and/or Clark and/or Wayland; and</p>

    asserts that most of the requested documents are not relevant, either temporally
    (they do not relate to the class period) or in subject matter (they do not
    relate to the improper accounting practices raised in the U.S. Class Action).  Deloitte
    therefore seeks to set aside the judgment of Sanderson J. to the extent that
    it orders production of the work papers and other documents listed in subparagraphs
    (a) through (c) of the letters rogatory on the basis that it would require
    a massive and burdensome effort to review, identify, separate and produce
    relevant documents.  Alternatively, Deloitte requests – for the first time
    on appeal – that sub-paragraphs 15(a) through (c) be narrowed to require
    production of only those particular sections of the working papers that have
    been identified as potentially containing relevant documents and that would
    not be burdensome for Deloitte to produce.  In short, Deloitte submits that
    the letters rogatory “are unjustifiably overbroad, unduly burdensome, and
    should not be enforced”.<a href="#_ftn1"

    argues that the evidence sought by it through the enforcement of the letters
    rogatory is of particular relevance to the U.S. Class Action, that the evidence
    is not otherwise obtainable, does not violate principles of Canadian public
    policy, was defined with reasonable particularity, and would not be unduly
    burdensome to Deloitte to produce.  The respondent therefore submits that
    the application judge properly exercised her discretion to enforce the letters
    rogatory issued by the U.S. District Court.  Nortel took no position at the
    application to enforce the letters rogatory and takes no position on this
    appeal.</p>

    application judge correctly, and succinctly, articulated the test to be applied

    before her agreed on the test.  She said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>All counsel
    agree on the criteria this Court should use in deciding whether or not the
    letters rogatory should be enforced.  <u>The evidence sought must be relevant,

    and must not be unduly burdensome</u>.  <i>OptiMight Communications Inc.

    (Republic) v. De Havilland Aircraft of Canada</i> (1991), 3 O.R. (3d) 705
    (C.A.).  See also <i>Zingre v. R</i>., [1981] 2 S.C.R. 392.  In <i>Fecht</i>,
    the court noted that the exercise of judicial discretion in the context of
    enforcing letters rogatory “requires the balancing of two broad considerations:
    the impact of the proposed order on Canadian sovereignty and whether justice
    requires that the taking of commission evidence be ordered” (p. 419).  Impact
    on Canadian sovereignty in this sense refers to the imposition of an unfair
    burden on, or prejudice to, the non-party citizen of the requestee state
    who is the target of the request.</p>

    behalf of Deloitte, Mr. Steiner relies heavily on the decision at first instance,
    and on appeal, in <i>Fecht</i>.  He submits the case cannot be distinguished
    from the present litigation.  And, indeed, there are similarities.  <i>Fecht</i> involved
    letters rogatory from the same U.S. District Court, in relation to a U.S.
    class proceeding alleging that a predecessor of Nortel had made falsely optimistic
    public statements about the company’s performance, as a result of which its
    share prices had fallen dramatically.  The letters rogatory sought the production
    of a wide-ranging set of documents from the same auditors, Deloitte &amp; Touche.  The
    request for an order enforcing the letters rogatory was declined on the basis
    that the relevancy of the requested documentation had not been established
    (they were said only to be “potentially”
    relevant), that the request was overly burdensome on Deloitte, and that the
    applicant had not established a sufficiently substantial link to the foreign
    jurisdiction (Ontario) to conclude that justice required the enforcement
    of the letters rogatory.  The decision was upheld on appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Fecht</i> is
    distinguishable from the present case, however.  In <i>Fecht</i>, the allegedly
    false and misleading statements related to primarily non-financial matters.  There
    was one specific accounting related issue involving the write-down of goodwill,
    but it was held that the request for production was overly broad to respond
    to that particular issue.  In short, Deloitte’s link to the issues in the <i>Fecht</i> U.S.
    proceeding was nothing more than that it was Northern Telecom’s general auditor,
    and some information in relation to the audit was “potentially relevant” to
    the lawsuit.</p>

line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    however, the allegations of false and misleading statements pertain directly
    to Nortel’s financial statements, and its restatements.  The complaint alleges
    that Nortel issued false and misleading public statements that overstated
    its financial condition and performance during the class period, and further
    that the statements included false and misleading information with respect
    to the nature and extent of the actual sales made by Nortel – all resulting
    in the artificial inflation of Nortel’s stock price.  Thus, allegations relating
    to improper financial reporting and accounting practices – as encapsulated
    in the five complaints referred to above
    – are at the heart of the U.S. Class Action.  Deloitte prepared both the
    financial statements and the restatements that are in issue and was directly
    involved in the restatement process.  Moreover, Nortel specifically defends
    on the grounds that it relied on the advice of its advisors, thus putting
    the contents of Deloitte’s working papers and other documentation in issue,
    as the application judge noted.</p>

    do not accept the appellants’ criticism that the application judge accorded
    too much deference to the U.S. court’s order.  She correctly observed that
    she was not bound by the conclusions of the requesting judge, but that “his
    observations and conclusions are entitled to deference and respect.”  I agree
    with her view that an Ontario court should “‘give full faith and credit’ to
    the orders and judgments of a U.S. court unless it is of the view that to
    do so would be contrary to the interests of justice or would infringe Canadian
    sovereignty”: see <i>Zingre v. R., supra</i>, at p. 401; <i>France (Republic)
    v. De Havilland Aircraft of Canada, supra</i>, at p. 715-716.  At the end
    of the day, she arrived at her own findings and conclusions, as summarized
    above.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    unseverable mix of relevant and irrelevant documents amongst the Requested
    Documents, together with the sheer volume of the production sought, is admittedly
    troubling in this case, as it was in <i>Fecht</i>.  However, Deloitte is
    a major financial audit and consulting firm, worldwide.  The application
    judge noted that it is obliged by professional standards to compile and secure
    its working papers in a manner in which they can be made available to regulatory
    entities and successor auditors.  It should follow that the documentation
    is not impossible to prepare for production.  Requests for the production
    of voluminous documentation, in electronic and hard copy form, are hardly
    unknown in today’s world of complex general and class action litigation.  In
    that sense, there is a certain “cost of doing business” element in the call
    for Deloitte to respond to the letters rogatory – an offset to the undoubtedly
    considerable revenues that the appellant earns from providing high level
    and complex auditing services to companies such as Nortel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Deloitte
    took an “all or nothing” approach before the application judge, contending
    that it would not be feasible to narrow the request by attempting to separate
    the relevant from the irrelevant in the circumstances – thereby tactically
    strengthening its argument based on
    “burdensomeness”.  On appeal, Deloitte attempted to resile from that position
    and argued that, if the court were to uphold the enforcement order, it should
    order one of a series of suggested options narrowing the production permitted
    under the letters rogatory.  While it was open to the application judge to
    narrow the request, she was not invited to do so, on the basis that it was
    impracticable.  In my view, fairness considerations preclude Deloitte from
    reversing that position now, on appeal.</p>

    application judge was satisfied that the Requested Documents had been identified
    by subject matter and timeframe, and that this was sufficiently specific
    in the circumstances. She was also satisfied that the requests for documents
    and for the testimony of Messrs. Clark and Wayland were not unduly burdensome
    or prejudicial to Deloitte, particularly in light of the undertakings given
    by OPT and the conditions that the application judge intended to impose.  Applying
    the specific criteria set out in <i>OptiMight Communications</i> and the
    more general principles synthesized in <i>Fecht</i> and in <i>France</i>,
    she concluded (reasons, para. 94):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I am of the
    view that justice requires the production of the Specified Documents and
    Specified Evidence.  I am satisfied that an order enforcing the letters rogatory
    in the form of Magistrate Judge Dolinger’s order of September 21, 2004 is
    in the interests of justice.  The evidence is indeed relevant, crucial and
    otherwise unavailable.  Its production in the manner ordered will not be
    unduly burdensome to Deloittes.  Given the undertakings of the Applicants
    and the pre-existing confidentiality agreements and protective orders, Deloittes’
    interests will not be unduly prejudiced in a manner that would infringe Canadian
    sovereignty.</p>
