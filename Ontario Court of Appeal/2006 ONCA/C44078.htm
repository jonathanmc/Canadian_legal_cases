style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Somerleigh argued that Mr. Polhill was served with the Notice and Order for
    Assessment by means of leaving copies with Clifford Cole at 223 Kingston

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;&quot;\[%2\:9\:0\:\]&quot; adairj 20060329T1657'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    balance of the key background facts are well-summarised in paragraphs 4 to
    9 of the reasons of the motion judge, set out below.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[4]  The time for appealing a Notice of Assessment
    under Rule&nbsp;62.01(2) is seven days after the date of the order or certificate
    appealed from.  The substance of this rule was in place at the time of Mr.&nbsp;Polhill’s
    assessment.  Even were it not so, Mr.&nbsp;Polhill could have applied to
    the court to set aside the Notice of Assessment once it came to his attention.  On
    the client’s own evidence that would have been in January&nbsp;of&nbsp;1994.  Rule&nbsp;19.08
    permits an aggrieved party to move to set aside a default judgment.  The
    moving party must move expeditiously after becoming aware of the default
    judgment, explain the reason for the default and show an arguable case on
    the merits.  Even if I accept that Mr.&nbsp;Polhill became aware of the assessment
    in January of 1994 at the earliest, he can hardly be said to have moved expeditiously
    to set it aside.  Nor is there any adequate explanation for the delay.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[5]  The solicitor deposes that he observed Mr.&nbsp;Polhill
    attending at an auction of his backhoe early in 1994.  This auction was conducted
    by the assessment officer Alvin Franks.  The evidence before me, which is
    not disputed, is that Mr.&nbsp;Polhill did not take issue with the debt prior
    to the auction, attempt to speak with the auctioneer about the matter, or
    attempt to stop the sale.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[6]  Further affidavit evidence filed by the solicitor
    deposes that Mr.&nbsp;Polhill paid his accounts with cheques containing the
    return address of 223 Kingston Street, Thunder Bay, and that he continues
    to correspond with the law firm with that return address.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[7]  The solicitor’s affidavit acknowledges that
    shortly before the trial, from which the fees resulted, the property at 223&nbsp;Kingston
    Street was transferred to Mr.&nbsp;Polhill’s parents.  It also sets out that
    Cliff Cole was personally known to the solicitor, having given evidence at
    Mr.&nbsp;Polhill’s trial voluntarily and without subpoena.  The solicitor
    deposed that, prior to the assessment, he personally attended at 223&nbsp;Kingston
    Street attempting to contact Mr.&nbsp;Polhill and met with Mr. Cliff Cole
    in his absence.  Mr.&nbsp;Cole advised the solicitor that he would ensure
    that any documents left at 223&nbsp;Kingston Street for Mr.&nbsp;Polhill
    would be given to him.  There is further evidence that the solicitor’s clerk
    spoke with Mr.&nbsp;Cole shortly after he accepted service of the documents
    and Mr.&nbsp;Cole confirmed that the assessment documents were given by him
    to Mr.&nbsp;Polhill.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[8]  I am satisfied on the evidence before me that
    the Notice of Assessment came to Mr.&nbsp;Polhill’s attention in <i>advance
    of the assessment</i>.  But even if I am wrong in that conclusion, Mr.&nbsp;Polhill
    has done nothing to move in a timely way to set aside the assessment [emphasis
    added].</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[9]  There is no adequate explanation for the delay
    in bringing <span class=msoDel>on</span> a motion to
    set aside the assessment of costs.  The law must function with some certainty
    so that decisions of the court, including solicitor and client assessments,
    speak with some finality.  There has in this case been excessive delay in
    bringing this matter back before the court, now some 10½ years beyond the
    time that Mr.&nbsp;Polhill, by his own admission, says the matter came to
    his attention.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;&quot;\[%2\:10\:0\:\]&quot; adairj 20060329T1657'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant says that Mr. Somerleigh was obliged to serve him properly with
    the Notice and Order for Assessment and that proper service was not effected.  The
    failure to effect proper service occurred because the appellant was neither
    personally served with the documents, nor served in accordance with the alternatives
    to personal service in rule 16.03 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> in
    that:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>(1)            no attempt was made
    to personally serve him with the documents;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>(2)            no service was made
    at his residence;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>(3)            Cliff Cole was not
    an adult member of his household; and, </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>(4)            the originating documents
    were not placed in a sealed envelope addressed to him nor were they mailed
    to him the same day or the next day at his residence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;&quot;\[%2\:11\:0\:\]&quot; adairj 20060329T1657'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that, in the absence of proper service, the proceedings
    are a nullity.  Consequently, he says, there was nothing to move against
    and there can be no onus on him to explain his delay in moving to set aside
    the Assessment Order or to satisfy the court that he moved in a timely fashion.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Preliminary Issue Concerning
      The Jurisdiction of the Court</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;&quot;\[%2\:12\:0\:\]&quot; adairj 20060329T1657'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant originally brought his appeal to the Divisional Court.  A panel

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior
    to the oral hearing of this appeal, counsel were referred to this court’s
    recent decision in <i>Sinnadurai v. Laredo Construction Inc.</i>, [2005]
    O. J. No 5429 (C.A.) and asked to make submissions on the jurisdiction of
    the Court of Appeal to hear the appeal.  At the oral hearing of the appeal,
    counsel advised that it was their joint view that jurisdiction properly lay
    with the Divisional Court.  The panel agreed with that submission.  Contrary
    to the conclusion reached by the Divisional Court, this appeal comes within
    that court’s jurisdiction as the Assessment Order is for a single payment
    of under $25,000.  However, in order to spare the parties further expense,
    at our request, the members of this panel were appointed as judges of the
    Divisional Court for the purpose of hearing the appeal. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    is pointed out by Garry D. Watson and Justice Craig Perkins in <i>Holmested
    and Watson: Ontario Civil Procedure</i>, looseleaf (Thomson Canada Ltd.:
    Toronto, 1993) at 2 - 6, rule 2.01 begins with a double declaration.  It
    declares that a failure to comply with the rules is an irregularity.  It
    also declares that such a failure does not render a proceeding or step or

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Assessment Order that the appellant moved to set aside was made on September
    15, 1992, and filed as an order of the court pursuant to the <i>Solicitors
    Act.</i>  In accordance with rule 2.01(1), the respondent’s failure to comply
    with the rules of service provided by the Rules of Civil Procedure does not
    render the Assessment Order a nullity.  Rather, that failure is an irregularity
    and, in accordance with rule 2.02(1)(b), the court may set aside the Assessment
    Order, as a matter of discretion, “only where and as necessary in the interest
    of justice.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;&quot;\[%2\:26\:0\:\]&quot; adairj 20060329T1657'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, this is not a case where setting aside the Assessment Order is “necessary
    in the interest of justice.”  My conclusion rests on the findings of fact
    made by the motion judge, findings that have not been attacked on appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;&quot;\[%2\:24\:0\:\]&quot; adairj 20060329T1657'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge found, on the appellant’s own admission, that some 10 1/2 years
    had elapsed from the time that the Assessment Order came to the appellant’s
    attention to when he brought his motion to set it aside.  She also found
    that the appellant had not moved in a timely way to set aside the Assessment
    Order and that he had not offered an adequate explanation for the delay.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the record, the motion judge was fully justified in these findings.  The
    appellant had experience with the court system in a number of proceedings
    in which Mr. Somerleigh and his partners represented him.  On his own evidence,
    the appellant also has a great deal of experience in bringing complaints
    about this matter.  In his affidavit filed in support of the motion, he deposes
    that after his sawmill and backhoe were seized and sold in January 1994,
    he went to the courthouse and complained.  The record shows that, over the
    years, he has complained to many people and organisations about Mr. Somerleigh
    and the assessment, including the federal Minister of Justice, the Regional
    Senior Justice, the Law Society of Upper Canada and the Ontario Judicial
    Council.  He has complained also to lawyers, family members and court personnel
    about the matter.  It strains credulity to the breaking point to hear the
    appellant allege that he was delayed in using the court system to set aside
    the Assessment Order because he did not know what to do “until now”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    disposing of this matter, I wish to note that the motion below to have the
    Assessment Order set aside was brought pursuant to rule 19.08 of the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i>.  In my view, rule 19.08 is inapplicable in the circumstances
    of this case.  Rule 19 governs default proceedings and rule 19.08 specifically
    governs the setting aside of default judgments.  The Assessment Order was
    filed as an order of the court pursuant to the <i>Solicitors Act; </i> it
    was not a default judgment and it was not obtained pursuant to the default
    proceedings.  The proper route in the circumstances of this case was for
    the appellant to have sought the leave of the court, pursuant to rule 2.02
    of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, to move to attack the Assessment
    Order on the basis of irregularity.  The relevant part of rule 2.02 reads
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A motion to attack a proceeding
    or a step, document or order in a proceeding for irregularity shall not be
    made, except with leave of the court,</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>(a)  after the expiry of
    a reasonable time after the moving party knows or ought reasonably to have
    known of the irregularity;     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the motion judge’s findings as set out above, it is clear that leave would
    not have been given as the appellant had not sought leave within a reasonable
    time after knowing of the irregularities in respect of service.</p>
