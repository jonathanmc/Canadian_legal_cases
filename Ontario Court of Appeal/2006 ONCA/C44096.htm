      Justice dated July 25, 2005.</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>A.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants argue that the application judge erred in law by concluding that
    the use of the respondent’s property to buy, sell, board, train, exercise
    and raise horses is a legal non-conforming use under the applicable municipal
    zoning by-law.  The appellants maintain that this use is a change from the
    historical use of the property that requires Committee of Adjustment approval
    under s.&nbsp;45(2) of the <i>Planning Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;P.13.  We
    disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge found as a fact: that the property in question was “continuously
    used for residential and agricultural purposes, up to and including the time
    the respondent acquired the property”; that the respondent’s lands were being
    used for agricultural purposes at the date of the enactment of the relevant
    by-law; that while the type of farming on the property had changed, the use
    of the property itself and the buildings for farming purposes had not substantially
    changed; and, finally, that the new use of buying, selling, boarding, training,
    exercising and raising quarter horses was simply a change of activities within
    the old use of the property for agricultural purposes, with little community
    impact.  These findings were open to the application judge on the record
    before him.  They, therefore, attract deference from this court.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that these findings are flawed because the application
    judge failed to consider the import in this case of s.&nbsp;45(2) of the <i>Planning
    Act</i>.  We reject this argument.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    45(2) of the <i>Planning Act</i> pertains to non-conforming uses that require
    variance approval.  But this is a legal non-conforming use that comes within
    the exemption contemplated by s.&nbsp;34(9) of the <i>Planning Act</i>.  Thus,
    the application of s.&nbsp;45(2) does not arise.  Put somewhat differently,
    on the facts here as found by the application judge, s.&nbsp;45(2) of the <i>Planning
    Act </i>is not engaged.  The application judge concluded that the use of
    the property itself did not change.  Rather, only the type of activities
    that together constitute the use were changed.  These altered activities
    are within the category of a “protected use”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    we do not agree with the appellants’ submission that <i>Saint Romuald (City
    v. Olivier</i>, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 898 has no application to planning law in
    Ontario.  In <i>Saint Romuald</i>,<i> </i>notwithstanding that the particular
    facts of the case arose in the context of legislation in Quebec, the Supreme
    Court of Canada detailed the factors to be taken into account in evaluating
    whether a land use change is of a quality and kind that operates to terminate
    a pre-existing legal non-conforming land use (or its equivalent).  These
    factors are of general import and application:  see <i>Olivier </i>at paras.
    32-34.  We find no fault with the application judge’s consideration and application
    of these factors in this case.  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent cross-appeals from the application judge’s costs disposition on
    the ground that the application judge erred by denying the respondent costs
    because, in the application judge’s view, the respondent was
    “somewhat the author of his own misfortune”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs
    awards by application judges attract considerable deference from this court.  Appellate
    intervention is warranted only where the application judge errs in principle,
    or the costs award is plainly wrong.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, in our opinion, the application judge misdirected himself by concluding
    that the respondent’s conduct leading up to the agreement of purchase and
    sale was relevant to the disposition of the costs of the application.  In
    the circumstances of this case, this was an irrelevant factor.  There is
    no suggestion that the respondent engaged in any conduct that would disentitle
    him to costs.  Moreover, there are no special circumstances here to warrant
    a departure from the usual rule that costs should follow the event of both
    the application and these proceedings.</p>

    the appeal is dismissed and the cross-appeal is allowed.  The respondent
    is entitled to his costs of the application and of the appeal and the cross-appeal
    on the partial indemnity scale, fixed in the total amounts of $4,800 and
    $4,000, respectively, including, in each case, disbursements and Goods and
    Services Tax.</p>
