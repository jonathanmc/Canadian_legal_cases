style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    following facts are largely drawn from the trial judge’s reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    September 5, 2001, Rob Carr was hired as a Belly Dump Truck Driver by P.D.
    Brooks. P.D. Brooks and Pioneer had a contractual relationship wherein P.D.
    Brooks delivered a mixture of sand and salt to Pioneer’s work site at the
    Ministry of Transportation’s (“M.T.O.”) “dome” site in West Nipissing. Pioneer
    had purchased and installed a Low-level Unloader with conveyor to move the
    sand mixture from the Belly Dump Truck to the Sand Domes. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    September 21, 2001, Mr. Carr delivered a load to the M.T.O. site at approximately
    7:00 a.m.  He positioned the dump portion of the truck over the conveyor
    belt and exited his truck.  Hugo Lafreniere, Pioneer’s Site Foreman/Supervisor,
    was the operator of the Unloader at that time.  Mr. Carr walked across the
    conveyor belt and joined Mr. Lafreniere.  He was not told to remain in the
    truck.  Mr. Lafreniere then started the Unloader and left the area to make
    a phone call.  Mr. Lafreniere was not present at the time of the accident. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Carr soon noticed that the flow of sand from the dump truck to the conveyor
    belt had ceased.  Accordingly, he picked up a sledgehammer that was kept
    beside the Unloader by Pioneer and started to bang the dump box to loosen
    the sand.  Mr. Carr did so while the Unloader was running.  He did not shut
    the machine off as he felt that it was not his place to do so.  Mr. Carr
    used the sledgehammer because he had seen others, including Mr. Lafreniere,
    use it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    banging on the side of the truck, a large portion of sand fell onto the conveyor
    belt and caught Mr. Carr’s left foot, causing him to lose his balance.  Mr.
    Carr fell on the conveyor belt and screamed.  The Unloader was shut off by
    another Pioneer employee, Stephane Girouard.  In the result, Mr. Carr’s legs
    had to be amputated below the knee. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Carr was not given any specific training on how to use the equipment and
    never received safety training.  He was told that Pioneer would show him
    how to use the equipment.  Kenneth Edwards, Pioneer’s Vice-President of Operations,
    confirmed that on the date in question the guards supplied by the manufacturer
    for the tail piece of the equipment were not installed.  (The tail piece
    was not involved in the accident.)  After the accident, Mr. Edwards directed
    his employees to install proper guards in the area where the accident occurred
    and candidly stated that had the guarding been in place prior to the accident
    the accident would not have happened. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    June 15, 2004, following a trial, Pioneer was convicted of two offences under
    the <i>OHSA</i>.  On June 8, 2005, Gordon J. allowed Pioneer’s appeal in
    part, ordering that the s. 11(b) <i>Charter </i>motion be returned to the
    Ontario Court of Justice for rehearing and disposition but otherwise upholding
    the convictions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    facts particularly relevant to the section 11(b) <i>Charter </i>issue are
    as follows.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Carr sustained his injury on September 21, 2001.  On September 17, 2002 (four
    days before the end of the limitation period), charges were laid by Information.  The
    first appearance was on October 21, 2002.  On October 15, 2002, the Crown
    elected to have the matter heard by a judge of the Ontario Court of Justice.  Accordingly,
    the case was adjourned to December 5, 2002, before a judge in Sturgeon Falls. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    that date, the case was adjourned to March 6, 2003, with a judicial pre&#8209;trial
    scheduled for January 22, 2003.  Counsel agreed that the pre&#8209;trial
    would take place by teleconference so that personal attendance would not
    be required.  On March 6, 2003, the Crown informed the court that it was
    prepared to set trial dates.  The defence requested further time to continue
    resolution discussions.  The court agreed and the matter was adjourned to
    June 5, 2003.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    June 5, 2003, the presiding justice adjourned the case to June 17, 2003,
    so that trial dates could be coordinated with the Regional Senior Justice.  The
    case was made returnable in North Bay, as it was thought by the presiding
    justice that it would be easier to obtain consecutive trial dates there. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    June 17, 2003, it did not prove possible to set the trial dates in North
    Bay and the case was adjourned back to Sturgeon Falls.  On July 3, 2003,
    the trial was tentatively set for North Bay for five days beginning January
    19, 2004 – the first dates in that year available to the defence.  Justice
    Lebel subsequently advised that he had a conflict with those dates and that
    the trial would have to be rescheduled.  It was eventually rescheduled for
    five days beginning March 22, 2004.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pioneer
    was aware of the circumstances giving rise to the s. 11(b) issue in September
    2003, when the trial dates were set for March 2004.  On February 25, 2004,
    the Ministry of Labour was served with Pioneer’s s. 11(b) Notice of Motion,
    which was made returnable on the first day of trial.  Pioneer’s Notice of
    Constitutional Question was served on March 5, 2004 on the Attorneys General
    of Ontario and Canada, as well as on the Ministry of Labour.  The trial judge
    asked counsel for an explanation as to why notice had not been served when
    the trial date was known in September 2003.  Counsel said that it was his
    understanding that the motion had to be served after arraignment at the start
    of the trial and he was also hopeful of a resolution with the Ministry. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice
    Lebel dismissed the motion on the basis that Pioneer had not complied with
    s. 109 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;C.43, as
    the Notice of Constitutional Question was not served as soon as the circumstances
    requiring it became known –&nbsp;<i>i.e.</i>&nbsp;in September 2003.  On
    appeal, Gordon J. overturned this ruling and sent the s. 11(b) motion back
    to the Ontario Court of Justice for rehearing and disposition. </p>

      will first deal with the issues raised by Pioneer in its appeal.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Did the appeal justice err
      by failing to hold that a trial judge is strictly prohibited from considering
      an employer’s voluntary, post-accident safety improvements in determining
      proof of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt, and the reverse onus on
      the appellant to prove the defence of due diligence on a balance of probabilities?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regardless
    of whether the evidence of post&#8209;accident conduct was admissible, Gordon
    J. was correct in his determination that the evidence of post&#8209;accident
    conduct did not affect the core of the trial judge’s reasons.  Accordingly,
    we would dismiss this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Did the appeal justice err
      in upholding the trial judge’s decision that Pioneer was the “employer” of
      a non-employee driver, who was directly employed by P.D. Brooks, a common
      carrier that was delivering sand to the M.T.O. yard?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    reasons in <i>R. v. Wyssen </i>(1992), 10 O.R. (3d) 193 (C.A.), are dispositive
    of this issue and we see no reason to revisit them.  There was no dispute
    that Pioneer had contracted for Mr. Carr’s services through his immediate
    employer, P.D. Brooks.  Just as a contractor who hires the services of a
    tradesperson through another employer (a sub-contractor) assumes responsibilities
    as an employer for that tradesperson while that person is working in a workplace
    under the control of the contractor, so Pioneer became the employer of Mr.
    Carr when he was working in a workplace controlled by Pioneer providing services
    to Pioneer.  The narrow definition of “employer” advanced by Pioneer is inconsistent
    with a purposive interpretation of the statute.  This ground of appeal also
    fails. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Did the appeal justice err
      in holding that the trial judge did not err in his failure to properly
      review the evidence of due diligence and give meaningful reasons for judgment
      in rejecting both branches of the due diligence defence in the face of
      an abundance of evidence to support the defence?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant concedes this issue was not raised as a ground of appeal before
    the provincial offences appeal judge.  Rather, Pioneer was satisfied to argue
    that the trial judge erred “when he failed to consider all relevant evidence
    with respect to the two branches of the defence of Due Diligence”.  The appeal
    judge fully considered and dismissed this ground of appeal by reference to
    the trial judge’s reasons.  We see no error in his conclusion.  In any event,
    we are satisfied that the reasons were sufficient to conduct meaningful appellate
    review. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pioneer’s
    appeal is therefore dismissed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    turn now to the issues raised in the Crown’s appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Did the appeal court err in
      setting aside the trial judge’s exercise of his discretion to not relieve
      Pioneer from its non-compliance with s. 109 of the <i>Courts of Justice
      Act</i>?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge held that Pioneer’s explanation for not bringing its motion in
    advance of the trial date was without merit and this played a significant
    role in his decision to dismiss the motion.  He held that the parties knew
    he was the trial judge and it would appear from the comments on the record
    that the practice in that jurisdiction is to bring s.&nbsp;11(b) motions
    in advance of the trial date.  Although the trial judge was advised by Pioneer’s
    counsel that the argument of the motion would only take about an hour, the
    trial judge appears to have been of the opinion that the trial time set aside
    would be compromised.  In fact, on the trial date Pioneer did not have all
    of the transcripts of the hearing dates, including the December 5, 2002 date
    when the defence requested an adjournment.  To obtain all of the transcripts
    might well have required a further adjournment and consequent delay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pioneer
    submits that because it was not able to argue the motion, it cannot be said
    that the motion was without merit.  We disagree.  As a corporate defendant,
    Pioneer is required to establish on appeal that there is a live issue that
    its right to a fair trial has been prejudiced by the delay: see <i>R. v.
    CIP Inc.</i>, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 843 at 861&#8209;863.  The only specific allegation
    of prejudice that Pioneer made was that a witness had gone missing.  The
    Crown provided the name and address of the witness to the defence well in
    advance of the trial and Pioneer chose not to call the witness.  There is
    nothing on the record or on the appeal to the provincial offences appeal
    court to indicate that Pioneer’s ability to make full answer and defence
    was prejudiced.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal judge held that the preferable time to raise a s.&nbsp;11(b) motion
    is at the end of a trial.  In thus holding, he had regard to decisions dealing
    with lost or destroyed evidence when the effect of the missing evidence on
    the ability to make full answer and defence or to have a fair trial could
    only be assessed after the rest of the evidence had been heard.  While there
    was an allegation of lost evidence here, by the opening of the trial it was
    no longer an issue and no missing evidence was specifically delineated before
    the appeal judge or before us.  The only suggestion of prejudice now put
    forward is the pre&#8209;charge delay of 11 months and the post&#8209;charge
    delay.  Pre-charge delay is a factor to consider respecting trial fairness:
    see <i>R. v. L. (W.K.)</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 1091 at 1100.  However, in this
    case there is no evidence that the pre-charge delay adversely affected the
    fairness of the trial.  Just as this court has held in <i>R. v. National
    Steel Car Ltd.</i> (2003), 63 O.R. (3d) 693, that the mere existence of pre&#8209;charge
    delay cannot justify granting a stay of proceedings, so, too, must it be
    held that the mere existence of pre&#8209;charge delay cannot justify granting
    a s.&nbsp;11(b) motion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to post&#8209;charge delay, Pioneer cannot rely on the presumption
    of prejudice resulting from the passage of time that arises respecting an
    individual accused.  As the Supreme Court of Canada held in <i>CIP Inc.</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    the inference of prejudice arising from the passage of time alone is linked
    to the liberty and security interests of an accused, not the fair trial interest.  A
    corporate entity does not have the right to liberty and security of the person
    within the meaning of the <i>Charter</i>.  Pioneer submits that the passage
    of time may have affected the memory of some witnesses or resulted in documents,
    which it could not specify, being unavailable.  Thus, Pioneer has not put
    forward any basis for finding an actual impairment of its ability to make
    full answer and defence. &nbsp;In the absence of some evidence of actual
    prejudice, the appeal judge erred in referring the matter back for hearing. </p>

    we disagree with the view of the appeal judge that the s.&nbsp;11(b) motion
    should have been argued at the end of the trial.  A motion to stay proceedings
    for a s.&nbsp;11(b) breach is ordinarily argued before trial absent unusual
    circumstances, which did not exist here.</p>

    the Crown’s appeal on the s. 11(b) issue is allowed, the decision of the
    appeal judge in this regard is set aside, and Pioneer’s conviction is affirmed. </p>
