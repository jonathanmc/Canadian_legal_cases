      2000, a dispute arose between Graywood Investments Limited (“Graywood”)
      and Toronto Hydro&#8209;Electric System Limited (“Toronto Hydro”) concerning
      whether the parties had agreed that Toronto Hydro would install an electricity
      distribution system in a Graywood building project and, if so, at what
      price.  Graywood made a complaint to the Ontario Energy Board (the “OEB”),
      which rendered a decision in favour of Toronto Hydro.</span></p>

      made an application for judicial review to the Divisional Court.  The three
      judges who heard the application agreed that the standard of review for
      the OEB decision was reasonableness.  However, the panel divided in its
      assessment of whether the OEB decision was reasonable.  Molloy&nbsp;J.,
      with Lane&nbsp;J. concurring, held that the decision was unreasonable;
      Pitt&nbsp;J., dissenting, concluded that it was “eminently reasonable”.</span></p>

      sole issue on this appeal is whether the Divisional Court erred in quashing
      the OEB decision.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>B.            <u>FACTS</u></span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>            (1)            <u>The
        parties and the events</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1999, Graywood commenced development of a residential subdivision in Scarborough
    (the “Scarborough project”).  At that time, Toronto Hydro was the monopoly
    provider of electricity distribution systems in Toronto.  In November&nbsp;1999,
    Graywood engaged Toronto Hydro to design the distribution system.  Graywood
    paid a “design deposit fee” of $63,140 in advance.  On June&nbsp;27,&nbsp;2000,
    Toronto Hydro sent its completed design to Graywood.  At that time, both
    parties would have expected Toronto Hydro, as the monopoly provider, to install
    the system as well.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    in mid&#8209;2000 the statutory regime governing electricity distribution
    changed to open the market to competition.  On July&nbsp;14,&nbsp;2000, the
    OEB issued a new <i>Distribution System Code</i> (the “<i>Code</i>”) which
    provided for a transition from monopoly to competition&#8209;based distribution.  The<i> Code</i> stipulated
    new and lower rates for the installation of distribution systems.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a result of an OEB decision on September&nbsp;29,&nbsp;2000, the OEB amended
    the <i>Code</i> by adding a transitional provision respecting its coming
    into force:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.7 Coming into Force</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This Code comes into force on the day subsection
    26(1) of the <i>Electricity Act</i> comes into force with the following exception.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>All of Chapter 3, <i>Connections and Expansions</i> and
    Subsection 6.2.3. of Section 6.2, <i>Responsibilities to Generators</i> come
    into force on September&nbsp;29,&nbsp;2000.  These provisions do not apply
    to projects that are the subject of an agreement entered into before November&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    early November&nbsp;2000, Graywood contacted Toronto Hydro about the connection
    of electricity for the Scarborough project.  Toronto Hydro insisted on a
    formal written connection agreement, which was drafted and executed in December
    2000, but was back&#8209;dated to November 8.  Taking the position that s.&nbsp;1.7
    of the <i>Code</i> applied to the project, Toronto Hydro charged Graywood
    at the higher rates applicable under the old monopoly regime and refused
    to allow Graywood to seek a competitive bid under the new regime.  Graywood
    protested but paid the higher fee and allowed Toronto Hydro to install the
    distribution system, while reserving its right to pursue a legal remedy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Graywood
    complained about the position taken by Toronto Hydro by letter to the OEB
    and requested a hearing on the issue of whether it had an agreement with
    Toronto Hydro before November 1, 2000 for electricity connection in its subdivision.  The
    OEB declined to hold a hearing but decided to conduct an investigation.  Graywood
    provided the OEB with a good deal of information about its relationship with
    Toronto Hydro relating to the Scarborough project.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    OEB issued its decision in a letter dated July&nbsp;25,&nbsp;2001.  It dismissed
    Graywood’s complaint and found that an implied agreement had been entered
    into prior to November&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2000, thus making the project subject
    to the higher rates in the former statutory regime.  The essence of the OEB
    decision is contained in these paragraphs:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Based on the information provided, the Board finds
    that an implied agreement had been entered into prior to November&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2000.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Board finds that in past industry practice,
    there was often no formal offer to connect and associated written connection
    agreement between parties on a specific project.  The evidence demonstrates
    that Graywood had agreed to Toronto Hydro undertaking preliminary design
    work with respect to the Project.  The evidence further demonstrates that
    Toronto Hydro had been included in the Project for approximately a year prior
    to November&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2000 and that Graywood was committed to the Project
    proceeding as municipal servicing had commenced prior to October of 2000.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Further, the Board finds that no unfairness has
    resulted as clearly the Graywood Project was costed based on past industry
    practice.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Board finds that Toronto Hydro is not required
    to comply with the requirements of Chapter 3 of the Code for this Project.  Therefore
    the Board finds that Toronto Hydro is not in breach of its licence and the
    Board will not issue a notice of its intention to issue a compliance order
    under subsection&nbsp;75(2) of the Act.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>            (2)            <u>The

      sought judicial review of the OEB decision.  The Divisional Court was unanimous
      in its view that the question determined by the OEB &#9472; namely, whether
      the agreement between Graywood and Toronto Hydro was entered into before
      or after November&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2000 in the context of s.&nbsp;1.7 of the <i>Code</i> &#9472; was
      a question of mixed fact and law.  The three judges also agreed, after
      applying the factors in <i>Pushpanathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship
      and Immigration)</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 982, that the standard of review
      to be applied to the OEB decision was reasonableness.</span></p>

      reasonableness standard to the OEB decision.  Molloy&nbsp;J., with Lane&nbsp;J.

      characterized the decision as
    “eminently reasonable”.</span></p>

      the result, the Divisional Court quashed the OEB decision and remitted
      the matter to the OEB for further consideration on the basis that the new <i>Code</i> provisions

      sole issue on the appeal is whether the majority of the Divisional Court
      erred in holding that it was unreasonable for the OEB to conclude that
      Toronto Hydro and Graywood had an agreement for electricity connection
      prior to November 1, 2000, and that the former statutory regime therefore
      applied to the Toronto Hydro–Graywood relationship.</span></p>

      three judges of the Divisional Court held, correctly, that the OEB decision
      in this case was subject to judicial review on a reasonableness standard.
      In my view, it is crucial that a reviewing court clearly appreciate both
      the content and the implications of the reasonableness standard of review.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      content of the reasonableness standard is clearly set out in two important
      Supreme Court of Canada decisions: <i>Law Society of New Brunswick v. Ryan</i>,
      [2003] 1&nbsp;S.C.R. 247, and <i>Dr. Q. v. College of Physicians and Surgeons
      of British Columbia</i>, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 226.  In both cases, the court
      elaborated on the application of the reasonableness standard to decisions
      of administrative tribunals.  In both cases, the court overturned the decision
      of the reviewing court and restored the decision of the tribunal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Crucially,
      in <i>Ryan</i> the court provided an analysis covering both the context
      within which judicial review on a reasonableness standard takes place and
      the precise legal question a reviewing court must ask.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      context within which judicial review on a reasonableness standard takes
      place can be summarized in a single word – deference.  As expressed by
      Iacobucci&nbsp;J. in <i>Ryan</i> at paras.&nbsp;46 and 51:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Judicial review of administrative
      action on a standard of reasonableness involves deferential self&#8209;discipline.  A
      court will often be forced to accept that a decision is reasonable even
      if it is unlikely that the court would have reasoned or decided as the
      tribunal did….</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN-US>. . .</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[C]ourts testing for unreasonableness
      must avoid asking the question of whether the decision is correct.  Unlike
      a review for correctness, there will often be no single right answer to
      the questions that are under review against the standard of reasonableness.  For
      example, when a decision must be taken according to a set of objectives
      that exist in tension with each other, there may be no particular trade&#8209;off
      that is superior to all others.  Even if there could be, notionally, a
      single best answer, it is not the court’s role to seek this out when deciding
      if the decision was unreasonable.</span></p>

      precise legal question a reviewing court must ask when applying the reasonableness
      standard was formulated by Iacobucci&nbsp;J. at para.&nbsp;47:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The content of a standard of review
      is essentially the question that a court must ask when reviewing an administrative
      decision.  The standard of reasonableness basically involves asking “After
      a somewhat probing examination, can the reasons given, when taken as a
      whole, support the decision?”  This is the question that must be asked
      every time…reasonableness [is] the standard.</span></p>

      continued, at para.&nbsp;55, by setting out, in relatively stark language,
      the implications for a reviewing court of trying to answer this question:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>A decision will be unreasonable
      only if there is no line of analysis within the given reasons that could
      reasonably lead the tribunal from the evidence before it to the conclusion
      at which it arrived.  If any of the reasons that are sufficient to support
      the conclusion are tenable in the sense that they can stand up to a somewhat
      probing examination, then the decision will not be unreasonable and a reviewing
      court must not interfere….</span></p>

    reasoned:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The parties here chose to date
      their contract November&nbsp;8,&nbsp;2000.  This was not inadvertent.  Toronto
      Hydro drafted the contract in December 2000.  It was deliberately back&#8209;dated
      to November&nbsp;8,&nbsp;2000 to reflect the point at which Toronto Hydro
      was first contacted by Graywood with respect to the installation of the
      distribution system.  In the face of that evidence, it is simply not reasonable
      to find that the agreement arose by implication earlier than November&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2000.</span></p>

      discussions about installation of the system and the parties’ expectations,
      and concluded that the OEB’s finding that there was an implied agreement

      and multi&#8209;faceted industry.  Its decisions are, therefore, entitled
      to substantial deference.  Interestingly, on this point Molloy&nbsp;J.’s
      analysis is clear and compelling:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>While the expertise brought to
      bear by the OEB in the case at bar is somewhat different from the situation
      before the Court in the <i>Consumer’s Gas</i> case, it is no less complex
      or specialized.  The Board was required to balance the interests of the
      consumer with those of electricity distributors, suppliers and contractors,
      all within the context of a market that was moving from a monopolistic
      structure to one with some aspects of competition, but still with supervision
      and controls.  The OEB’s expertise includes not just the provision of electricity
      but many other aspects of construction, engineering and subdivision planning
      and control.  The specialized nature of the OEB’s expertise demands a relatively
      high degree of deference to its decisions.</span></p>

      the legislation in issue in this case, including the transitional provision
      found in s.&nbsp;1.7 of the <i>Code</i>, is legislation that the OEB itself
      drafted.  In other words, this is not even a case where a tribunal is called
      upon to interpret a statute enacted by a legislature; rather, the tribunal
      is required to interpret statutory language that it drafted.  Thus, the
      law&#8209;intensive component of the analysis on a question of mixed fact
      and law is one particularly well&#8209;suited to the tribunal.  In my view,
      this raises the deference bar even higher.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third,
      the question of mixed fact and law at the centre of the case shades substantially
      onto the fact side of the spectrum.  On this point, I agree with Pitt&nbsp;J.’s
      description:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[T]he question whether the project
      was subject to an agreement entered into before November&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2000
      within the meaning of s.&nbsp;1.7 of the <i>Code</i> is more appropriately
      viewed as a question of mixed fact and law….The “law” component of that
      issue is the interpretation of the provisions of the <i>Code</i>, as they
      relate to the proper management of a major transition from monopoly to
      competition under the <i>OEB Act</i>, rather than general contractual principles.  The
      determination is “fact&#8209;intensive”, and involves an assessment of
      specialized facts and relationships, which are at the core of the OEB’s
      exclusive jurisdiction.  See <i>Law Society of New Brunswick v. Ryan</i>,
      [2003] 1 S.C.R. 247, at para.&nbsp;41; <i>Dr. Q. v. College of Physicians
      and Surgeons of B.C.</i>, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 226 at p.&nbsp;240.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fourth,
      on the record in this case, including the OEB’s written reasons for decision,
      I think it is impossible to conclude, <i>per</i> the instruction in <i>Ryan</i>,
      that there is “no line of analysis” to support the decision.  The OEB identified
      several factors in support of its conclusion that “an implied agreement
      had been entered into prior to November&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2000.”  It reviewed
      industry practice, which was not always grounded in formal contracts or
      agreements.  The OEB also considered the relationship between the parties
      concerning the Scarborough project.  Toronto Hydro was retained to perform
      the design work on the project and successfully completed it.  Moreover,
      Toronto Hydro’s role in the project had continued for about one year before
      the November&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2000 cut&#8209;off date.  In addition, the OEB
      specifically considered Graywood’s position.  It noted that Graywood was
      committed to the project before the cut&#8209;off date and had costed the
      project on the basis of installation prices under the old statutory regime;
      this led the OEB to declare that its proposed decision would not be unfair
      to Graywood.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Combining
      these points, I think it is clear that the OEB was of the view that the
      history of the parties’ relationship on this project, including the completed
      design assignment, industry practice generally, and fairness considerations,
      resulted in an implied agreement that the installation component of the
      project would be performed by Toronto Hydro under the pre&#8209;November&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2000
      statutory regime.  This was not the only interpretation and result open
      to the OEB.  However, within the parameters of<i> Ryan</i>, <i>Dr.&nbsp;Q.</i> and <i>Donnini</i>,
      the OEB’s interpretation and disposition were, as Pitt&nbsp;J. concluded, “eminently
      reasonable”.</span></p>
