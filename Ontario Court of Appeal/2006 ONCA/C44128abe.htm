  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from conviction by Justice
    Kofi Barnes of the Ontario Court of Justice dated June 20, 2005 and sentence
    imposed September 13, 2005</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>.</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>APPEAL&nbsp;BOOK ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge gave thorough and comprehensive reasons for
    conviction. He was obviously alive to the frailties in the complainant’s
    evidence and in particular, the inconsistencies in her testimony and the fact
    that she had earlier made a false allegation against the appellant. In the case
    of some of the inconsistencies, the trial judge put them down to the young age
    of the complainant and her inability to recall the types of details that adults
    might be expected to remember. That was a finding that the trial judge was
    entitled to make and we see no basis for interfering with it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said, the trial judge was still sufficiently concerned
    about the evidence of the complainant that he felt the need to look for
    confirmatory evidence before relying upon her testimony to convict. In that
    regard, the trial judge set out five items of evidence which he considered to
    be confirmatory. We agree that item (1) on the list i.e. that the complainant
    did not “back down this time” unlike she did with respect to the first set of
    allegations she had earlier made against the appellant, was not capable of
    being confirmatory. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree with the appellant as to the other four items. In
    our view, all of them served to restore the trial judge’s faith in the
    credibility and reliability of the complainant’s testimony and particularly
    those where the appellant changed his initial version to conform with her
    recollection as to what had occurred. In addition, there was other evidence
    which the trial judge did not mention that in our view, he could have relied
    upon as confirmatory. One example is the appellant’s attempt to mislead the
    police by advising them that he had disposed of the vibrator, when in fact, he
    had hidden it in a suitcase that the police located in one of his closets.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, to the extent that the trial judge took into
    account one item of evidence as “confirmatory” that he should not have, the
    error in our view was harmless. Had he not made the error, the verdict would
    necessarily have been the same. Accordingly, we would dismiss the appeal from
    conviction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to sentence, without minimizing the gravity and
    seriousness of the appellant’s crimes, we feel that having regard to the nature
    of the abuse i.e. brief foundling of the complaint’s vagina on two occasions
    that were proximate in time and the appellant’s otherwise unblemished
    background, the seventeen month sentence exceeded the range of sentences that
    this court has imposed in like circumstances. Accordingly, we would reduce the
    custodial portion of the sentence from seventeen months to twelve months. We
    would not otherwise interfere with the sentence imposed by the trial judge. On
    the s. 161 order (20 years) which the appellant questioned, we note that the
    appellant has the right to apply to have it varied and we are not persuaded
    that the trial judge erred in exercising his discretion as he did. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted and the
    sentence is varied to give effect to these reasons.</p>
