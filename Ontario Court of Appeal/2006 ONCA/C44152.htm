      several parcels of land in the Town of Wasaga Beach, in the County of Simcoe
      from Green-wall Forming Limited (“Green-wall”) for the purpose of building
      a subdivision (the “Development Lands”).  As security for part of the purchase

      acquired two additional parcels of land from the Corporation of the Town
      of Wasaga Beach (the “Town”) on May 20, 1999, for the stated consideration
      of $2.00.  These parcels provided road access to the Development Lands.  They
      consisted of a one-foot reserve surrounding the Development Lands (Block “D”)
      and four lots (the “Lots”) that had been dedicated by the Town as a public

      Inc. attempted on several occasions to purchase the Access Lands from Dynasty.  When
      these attempts proved unsuccessful because the parties were unable to agree
      upon a purchase price, Ontario Inc. commenced proceedings attacking the
      validity of the Town’s conveyance of the Access Lands to Dynasty (the “Challenged
      Conveyance”).  On November 12, 2004, it brought an application in the Superior
      Court of Justice seeking declarations that the transfer/deed of land from
      the Town to Dynasty concerning the Challenged Conveyance was void; that
      Dynasty had no right, title or interest in the Access Lands; and that the
      Town continued to be the legal and beneficial owner of the Access Lands.  The

      turn, submits that s.&nbsp;193 had no application in the circumstances
      of this case because the Challenged Conveyance did not involve the “sale” of “surplus” land,
      so as to engage s.&nbsp;193.  Dynasty maintains that the Challenged Conveyance

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(2) If s.&nbsp;193 applied to

      I have said, the application judge held that s.&nbsp;193 did not apply
      to the Town’s transfer of Block “D” to Dynasty.  More generally, she appears
      to have held that the entirety of the Challenged Conveyance was governed
      by s.&nbsp;297, rather than s.&nbsp;193, and that the Town had complied
      with the requirements of s.&nbsp;297.  She stated:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   Section 193, and its procedural requirements
    are concerned with surplus property and hardly designed for the transfer
    of one foot strips of land separating building lots from their access roadway.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>….</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   I find the intended purpose [of the Challenged
    Conveyance] falls within s.&nbsp;297 and not s.&nbsp;193.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   It was, parenthetically, certainly never intended
    that the conveyance, part of a series of covenants to facilitate the development
    of lands dependent on it for access to the road-way, would remain in the
    hands of a defaulting mortgagor, no longer for the benefit of those who acquire
    the building lots in Block B.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   Counsel for the Applicant has not tied the provisions
    of s.&nbsp;297 to the procedural requirements of s.&nbsp;193. Nor have I
    been persuaded that there are other procedures, necessary to the integrity
    of a by-law passed for purposes addressed by s.&nbsp;297, with which the
    municipality failed to comply.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    conclude, with respect, that the application judge erred in law by holding
    that s.&nbsp;193 was inapplicable to the Town’s conveyance of Block “D” to
    Dynasty and that the Challenged Conveyance was valid under s.&nbsp;297.  I
    reach this conclusion for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    core of the application judge’s analysis concerned the Town’s intention in
    making the Challenged Conveyance, rather than the character of the transaction
    itself and the purpose and scope of s.&nbsp;193.  This is evident from her
    conclusion regarding the Town’s intent:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>I find that</i> <i>there is no doubt as to the
      intention of the municipality</i>.  It was to facilitate access between
      the roadway and the building lots.  <i>To accomplish this intention</i>,
      in the context of the subdivision negotiations, the strip and lots were
      conveyed to the then owner, Dynasty [emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is also demonstrated by the application judge’s comments, quoted-above, concerning
    the “intended purpose [of the Challenged Conveyance]”, her observation that “it
    was … certainly never intended that the conveyance …
    would remain in the hands of a defaulting mortgagor”, and her finding that
    the Challenged Conveyance was “part of a series of covenants to facilitate
    the development of lands dependent on [the Access Lands] for access to the
    roadway”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    focus on the Town’s intention in transferring the Access Lands to Dynasty
    diverted the application judge’s attention away from the purpose and scope
    of the scheme established by s.&nbsp;193 and the meaning of the words “sale” and “surplus” real
    property, as used in s.&nbsp;193.  These issues, which were key to determining
    whether s.&nbsp;193 applied to the Challenged Conveyance, were not mentioned
    by the application judge in her reasons.  Accordingly, I address these matters
    next.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>(i)            Purpose and Scope of Section 193</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior
    to the mid-1990s, municipalities were free to sell their surplus land as
    they deemed appropriate, subject to judicial review in some circumstances.  However,
    effective January 1, 1995, s.&nbsp;193 was revised by the <i>Planning and
    Municipal Law Amendment Act, 1994</i>, S.O. 1994, c.23, s. 55 “to provide
    a more transparent and accountable procedure respecting the sale of municipal
    real property by requiring that a municipality pass a land sale procedure
    by-law, provide public notices and hold meetings prior to the sale of municipal
    real estate”: see Stephen Auerback and John Mascarin, <i>The Annotated Municipal
    Act</i>, 2d Ed., looseleaf vol. 1 (Toronto: Thomson Carswell, 2004) at 6-75
    - 6-76.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    Auerback and Mascarin suggest, the purpose of s.&nbsp;193 was to provide
    the public with an open process for the sale of municipal land, disclosure
    of the procedures applicable to such sales, and an opportunity for discussion – including
    potential objection – regarding contemplated sales.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this context, s.&nbsp;193 established a scheme for the
    “sale” by a municipal council or local board (a “municipality”) of “surplus”
    real property.  The cornerstone of this scheme was the requirement under
    s.&nbsp;193(2) that every municipality “with authority to sell or otherwise
    dispose of real property” enact a by-law establishing “procedures, including
    the giving of notice to the public, governing the sale of real property” (a “procedure
    by-law”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the passing of a procedure by-law was mandatory, s.&nbsp;193(3) provided
    a municipality with a discretion regarding the procedures to be established
    for the sale of “different classes of real property” and to incorporate a
    procedure for the sale of a municipality’s real property “required by this
    or any other Act”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly,
    s.&nbsp;193(4) provided that before “selling any real property”, a municipality
    was required to do the following: (i) by by-law or resolution passed at a
    public meeting, declare the real property to be
    “surplus” (s.&nbsp;193(4)(a)); (ii) obtain at least one appraisal of the
    fair market value of the real property at issue (s.&nbsp;193(4)(b)); and
    (iii) give notice to the public of the proposed sale (s.&nbsp;193(4)(c)).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    requirements reflected the legislature’s intention that the sale of real
    property by a municipality be conducted in accordance with an open and publicly
    disclosed process, based on a fair market valuation of the applicable property
    and opportunity for public participation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the same time, the scheme established by s.&nbsp;193 also envisaged that
    the sale of some municipal properties need not be subject to an elaborate
    disposition process.  This was recognized under s. 193 in two ways.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    as I have mentioned, s.&nbsp;193(3)(a) afforded a municipality the discretion
    to establish “different procedures for different classes of real property”.  Under
    this section, therefore, a municipality could chose to streamline the procedures
    governing the sale of defined classes of municipal land including, for example,
    parcels of a particularly small size or land comprising a highway or a road
    allowance.  Second, s.&nbsp;193(6)(a) authorized the Minister,<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[3]</span></a> by regulation,
    to exempt prescribed classes of real property from the appraisal and public
    register listing requirements otherwise established by ss.&nbsp;193(4)(b)
    and 193(7).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, at the time of the Challenged Conveyance, the Town had not acted
    under the authority of s.&nbsp;193(3)(a) to introduce different procedures
    for different classes of real property.  In contrast, O. Reg. 815/94, passed
    by the Minister under s.&nbsp;193(6)(a), established a series of exemptions
    from the appraisal and public register listing requirements.  For example,
    under s.&nbsp;1 of O. Reg. 815/94, an appraisal need not be obtained by a
    municipality in relation to the sale of: (i) land 0.3 metres or less in width “acquired
    in connection with an approval or decision under the <i>Planning Act</i>”;
    (ii) highways, roads and road allowances; or (iii) land that did not have
    direct access to a highway, if sold to an abutting landowner.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    neither s. 193(3)(a) nor s. 193(6)(a) envisaged the avoidance of the core
    requirements of the s. 193 scheme, namely, the requirement for a procedure
    by-law that made provision for notice to the public of a proposed sale of
    municipal land (s. 193(2)) and actual notice to the public of the sale (s.
    193(4)(c)).</p>

      submits that the Challenged Conveyance was not subject to the procedural
      scheme of s.&nbsp;193 because the Access Lands were not “purchased by a
      sale or sales transaction” and were not “surplus” lands.  It relies on
      the affidavit evidence of Richard Rupp, the principal of Dynasty.  In an
      affidavit sworn on July 27, 2005, Mr. Rupp claimed that, “[T]he entire
      subject of the Transfer, being both [Block “D”] and the [Lots] were <i>[sic] </i>in
      fulfillment of various agreements between the Town and [Dynasty]” and that
      the Access Lands were never
    “surplus land” or “purchased via a sale or sales transaction”.  According
    to Mr. Rupp, conveyance of Block
    “D” in particular, was not a “sale” but, rather, was “a Transfer of land
    that arose out of negotiations surrounding the proposed subdivision agreement”.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Since
      Mr. Rupp was not cross-examined on his affidavit materials and Ontario
      Inc. did not proffer any evidence from the Town to contradict or respond
      to his evidence,  Dynasty argues that Mr. Rupp’s </span>uncontradicted<span lang=EN-US> evidence
      conclusively established that the Challenged Conveyance “was not a sale
      and was not surplus land”.  In supplementary written submissions dated
      June 15, 2006 and filed with this court, Dynasty elaborated:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[T]he uncontradicted evidence
      of [Dynasty] …
    was that the land was transferred not pursuant to a sale but was a transfer

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      would reject this argument for several reasons.  First, whether the Challenged
      Conveyance was a “sale” of
    “surplus” land within the meaning of s.&nbsp;193 is not determined by the
    bald assertions of a litigant as to the nature of the transaction in issue
    and as to the legal status of the lands forming the subject matter of the
    transaction.  Dynasty has failed to show how the Challenged Conveyance was
    something other than a “sale”.  Neither Mr. Rupp’s affidavit evidence nor
    the record as a whole disclose the nature or content of the alleged negotiations
    and agreements between the Town and Dynasty that are said to have precipitated
    the Challenged Conveyance.  Nor were copies of any documents evidencing such
    dealings between the Town and Dynasty filed with the application judge.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, even if <span lang=EN-US>the Challenged Conveyance arose in “the
    context of… subdivision negotiations” and the transfer was “part of a series
    of covenants to facilitate the development of [the Development Lands]”, as
    found by the application judge, </span>this falls short of a demonstration
    that the Challenged Conveyance was something other than a “sale” of real
    property by the Town.  </p>

      v. St. Thomas (City)</i>, [1995] O.J. No. 1570 (Gen. Div.), the conveyance
      by a municipality of parking lands to a developer for the stated consideration
      of $1.00 was held to be a sale of land within the meaning of s.&nbsp;193,
      rather than an illegal gift or donation of land by the municipality as
      contended by the applicant in that case.  In <i>Liberatore</i> at para.
      63, Killeen&nbsp;J. held that the entire course of dealings between the
      municipality and the developer compelled the conclusion that the conveyance
      of the parking lands was part of “a package sale or disposition” by the
      municipality of both hospital and parking lands for a total negotiated
      price of $85,000.</p>

lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    this reasoning, even if the Challenged Conveyance was part of a larger, related
    series of transactions between the Town and Dynasty pertaining to a proposed
    subdivision agreement, as claimed by Dynasty, the conveyance was a “sale” of
    land within the meaning of s.&nbsp;193.</p>

      and importantly, Dynasty’s claim that the Challenged Conveyance did not
      involve a “sale” runs counter to the meaning of the term “sale” under s.&nbsp;193
      and with the purpose and scope of the scheme established under that section
      for the sale of municipal real estate.</span></p>

      193(1) provided limited guidance concerning the meaning of the word “sale” as
      it is used in s.&nbsp;193.  It stated only that a “sale includes a lease
      of 21 years or longer”.  Under this </span>inclusionary definition, many
      forms of transactions involving the disposition of municipal real property
      could constitute a “sale” for the purpose of s.193.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>“Sale” is
    defined in the <i>Oxford English Reference Dictionary</i>, 2d ed. <i>s.v.</i> “sale” as “n.
    1. the exchange of a commodity for money etc; an act or instance of selling”.  Similarly,
    in Daphne Dukelow, <i>Dictionary of Canadian Law </i>(Scarborough: Thomson
    Canada Limited, 2004) <i>s.v.</i> “sale”, the word is defined in expansive
    terms: “4. Includes (a) exchange, barter, sale on credit, conditional sale,
    sale where the price is payable by installments, transfer of title, conditional
    or otherwise, and any other contract whereby for a consideration a person
    delivers goods to another; (b) a transfer of possession, conditional or otherwise,
    or a lease or a rental, determined to be in lieu of a transfer of title,
    exchange or barter”.  See also <i>Black’s Law Dictionary</i>, 7th ed. <i>s.v.</i> “sale”,
    where it is defined as: “n. 1. The transfer of property or title for a price.  2.
    The agreement by which such a transfer takes place.  The four elements are
    (1) parties competent to contract, (2) mutual assent, (3) a thing capable
    of being transferred, and (4) a price in money paid or promised”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    definitions suggest that, according to both its ordinary and usual legal
    meaning, the word “sale” enjoys a wide ambit unless the context in which
    it is used indicates a contrary intention.  See also <i>H.W. Liebig &amp; Co.
    v. Leading Investments Ltd.</i>, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 70.  Section&nbsp;193 contained
    no words of limitation constraining the meaning of the word “sale” as employed
    in that section.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the purpose of the scheme established by s.&nbsp;193 for the sale of real
    property militates in favour of a broad construction of the concept of a “sale”.  That
    scheme, in my opinion, was intended to bind municipalities to an open and
    participatory public process concerning the disposition of municipal lands,
    regardless of the purpose of the transaction in question.  No doubt for that
    reason, the legislature chose not to define the word
    “sale” in exhaustive terms but, rather, to rely on the ordinary expansive
    meaning of the word “sale”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    I would reject any suggestion that the Challenged Conveyance was unsupported
    by consideration.  In his affidavits, Mr. Rupp acknowledged that the transfer/deed
    of land between the Town and Dynasty concerning the Access Lands provided
    for the payment of nominal consideration ($2.00) by Dynasty to the Town.  He
    claimed, however, that this consideration was “strictly for registration
    purposes” and that Dynasty was never required to actually pay the stated
    amount to the Town.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
    Mr. Rupp also said in an affidavit sworn on March 18, 2005 that the Challenged
    Conveyance was “an exchange of land rights” and that Dynasty “provided consideration
    for the exchange of lands”.  As I have indicated, in a later affidavit sworn
    by him on July 27, 2005, Mr. Rupp claimed that the transfer to Dynasty of
    Block “D”, “arose out of negotiations surrounding the proposed subdivision
    agreement”.  He also stated that, in respect of this transfer, Dynasty “fulfilled
    its conditions”.  The alleged “conditions” were not described.  Finally,
    in his affidavit sworn on February 14, 2005, Mr. Rupp stated that “consideration
    was provided by Dynasty” for the Access Lands and that “the transfer was <i>bona
    fide</i>”.  In my view, it is not open to Dynasty to resile from these admissions
    in order to resist the relief claimed by Ontario Inc. on the basis that no
    monetary consideration was paid for the Access Lands.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally,
      I note that in <i>Liberatore, supra</i>, Killeen J. placed reliance on
      s. 191 of the Act, which authorized the council of every municipal corporation
      to dispose of land acquired or expropriated by the corporation when the
      land was no longer required for the purposes of the corporation. He commented
      at para. 59:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As it seems to me, the key words in s. 191 are
    those which say “may sell or otherwise dispose of the same. …” The word “sell” in
    this phrase clearly denotes a sale or transaction having a commercial character.
    It must mean an exchange for value and excludes a clear gift. The balance
    of the phrase “or otherwise dispose of the same”
    allows, in my view, for flexible commercial exchanges of precisely the kind
    that occurred here. </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>As the relevant
      provisions of s. 191 of the Act considered in <i>Liberatore</i> were identical
      to those in force at the time of the Challenged Conveyance, Killeen J.’s
      comments are apposite here.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      these considerations, I conclude that the Challenged Conveyance was a “sale” of
      real property within the meaning of s. 193 of the Act. </span></p>

      claim rests on the following assertions by Mr. Rupp in his affidavits:
      that the Access Lands were “never surplus lands”; that the fact that By-law
      No. 99-21 referenced s.&nbsp;297 of the Act (which dealt with the “stopping
      up” of highways or road allowances), evidenced that the Challenged Conveyance
      did not deal with “surplus land or a sale”; that the Town’s failure to
      seek the return to it of the Access Lands (by expropriation or otherwise)
      was indicative of the Town’s knowledge that the Challenged Conveyance was
      not “the sale of surplus land”; and that the nominal monetary consideration
      promised by Dynasty for the Access Lands demonstrated that the Access Lands
      were not “surplus” lands.  In my opinion, the assertion that the Access
      Lands were not “surplus” is misconceived. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      have already indicated that a bare claim by Dynasty as to the nature of
      the Challenged Conveyance is not determinative of its legal character;
      nor is it dispositive of the legal status of the Access Lands for the purpose
      of s.&nbsp;193.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Similarly,
      the fact that the Town did not seek the return of the Access Lands is irrelevant
      to the question whether s.&nbsp;193 applied to the Challenged Conveyance.  In
      any event, the record is silent regarding the Town’s position concerning
      the status of the Access Lands and as to the Town’s knowledge of its legal
      rights in relation to those properties.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
      well, for the reasons already given, I do not accept that the nominal monetary
      consideration cited in the transfer/deed between the Town and Dynasty concerning
      the Access Lands supports the conclusion that the Access Lands were not “surplus” in
      the Town’s hands.  On Dynasty’s own evidence, the Challenged Conveyance
      was supported by other valid consideration, the receipt and sufficiency
      of which Dynasty has not contested.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Nor
      does By-law No. 99-21 bolster the assertion that the Access Lands were
      not
    “surplus” lands.  The third recital of By-law No. 99-21 expressly states, “AND
    WHEREAS the said lands are not required for the purposes of the [Town].”  This
    suggests that the lands dealt with under this by-law were “surplus” to the
    Town’s needs.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally,
      although s.&nbsp;193 (and s. 193(4) in particular) contained no definition
      of the word “surplus”, based on a reading of s. 193 as a whole, there is
      no reason to conclude that the term “surplus” as used in s. 193 was intended
      to have a special, rather than its ordinary and plain meaning. </span></p>

      my view, the references to “surplus” land contained in the heading to s.
      193 and in s. 193(4)(a) simply mean land that is no longer required for
      the use of the relevant municipality. This interpretation conforms to the
      ordinary meaning of the word “surplus” – something that is left over when
      requirements have been met.  It also accords with s.&nbsp;191(1), which
      authorizes the sale or other disposition of land acquired or expropriated
      by a municipality when such land is “no longer … required”.</span></p>

      conclude, therefore, that the Challenged Conveyance was a sale of surplus
      real property by the Town.  Accordingly, unless s. 297 operated to oust
      s.&nbsp;193 in the circumstances of this case –
    an issue that I discuss later in these reasons – s. 193 applied to the Challenged
    Conveyance and the Town was required to satisfy its procedural requirements.  I
    turn now to the question whether those requirements were met.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(2)            Requirements
      of Section 193</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I understood its original submissions to this court, Dynasty did not argue
    that the Town met the procedural requirements of s.&nbsp;193 in respect of
    the Challenged Conveyance.  Instead, it took the position that s.&nbsp;193
    did not apply in this case.  However, in its supplementary written submissions
    dated June 15, 2006, Dynasty asserted that there was “absolutely no evidence
    that the [Town] did not do an appraisal of any of [the] two separate parcels
    of land” and that a similar evidential ‘gap’
    existed as to whether the Town provided public notice of the proposed Challenged
    Conveyance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    shift in position is inconsistent with the following factual findings by
    the application judge:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[The Town] had no such by-law of procedures [as
    required by s.&nbsp;193(2) of the Act].  By s.&nbsp;193(4) any sale required
    a by-law or resolution at an open meeting to declare the property surplus,
    obtain an appraisal and give notice to the public of the sale.  This was
    not done.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dynasty
    maintains, however, that “it is impossible to determine that there was no
    publication” by the Town in respect of the Challenged Conveyance because
    the evidence established that the Town did not keep records of public notices
    at the relevant time.  It also argues that Ontario Inc. bore the burden of
    demonstrating that the Town failed to comply with s.&nbsp;193.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    I agree that Ontario Inc. was obliged to show that the Challenged Conveyance
    triggered s.&nbsp;193 of the Act and that the Town did not satisfy the requirements
    of s.&nbsp;193, to displace the factual findings of the application judge
    it is incumbent on Dynasty to demonstrate that the impugned findings are
    tainted by palpable and overriding error.  Dynasty did not cross-appeal from
    the application judge’s decision; nor did it otherwise expressly challenge
    her findings before this court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario
    Inc. alleged in its affidavit materials that the Town failed to comply with
    certain of the mandatory requirements of s.&nbsp;193, including the public
    notice requirements of that section.  Thus, there was some evidence to support
    the application judge’s finding that no notice was given.  In the face of
    Ontario Inc.’s allegation, if Dynasty wished to resist Ontario Inc.’s application
    on the basis that there had been no violation of s.&nbsp;193 by the Town,
    it was incumbent on Dynasty to adduce evidence of compliance with s.&nbsp;193.  It
    failed to do so.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is a contest between competing developers who adopted opposite positions
    on the legal validity of the Challenged Conveyance.  I agree with the application
    judge’s observation that, “This is a sheer commercial dispute in which the
    parties argue principles of municipal law in order to gain advantage in their
    private disputes.”  It was open to both parties to adduce evidence from the
    Town regarding the procedures followed in relation to the Challenged Conveyance.  There
    is no property in a witness.  In my opinion, in a case like this one, it
    cannot be said that the burden fell solely on Ontario Inc. to introduce evidence
    relevant to the determination of the statutory interpretation questions raised
    in this proceeding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, it is clear on this record that the Town did not satisfy at least
    some of the key procedural requirements of s.&nbsp;193.  Contrary to s.&nbsp;193(2),
    at the time of the Challenged Conveyance, the Town had no procedure or other
    by-law in place that provided for public notice of the proposed sale of municipal
    land.  In addition, in respect of the conveyance of Block “D”, the Town failed
    to pass a by-law or resolution declaring Block “D”
    to be surplus land as required by s. 193(4).  It also breached s.&nbsp;101(1),
    which required that the powers of a municipality be exercised by by-law.</p>

      recognize that a technical failure to comply with the procedural requirements
      of s.&nbsp;193 may not always vitiate a sale of surplus real property by
      a municipality.  For example, s.&nbsp;193(5) provided:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>The manner in which the council or
      local board carries out the sale of its property, <i>if consistent with

      am also aware that it is arguable that the Access Lands were exempt from
      the appraisal and public register listing requirements of ss.&nbsp;193(4)(b)
      and 193(7) by virtue of those provisions of O. Reg. 815/94 that pertained

    “highways, roads and road allowances” and “land 0.3 </span>metres<span

      the Town’s intention in effecting the Challenged Conveyance did not override
      the requirements of s. 193.  The fact that the Town may have intended the
      sale of the Access Lands to facilitate the development of the Development
      Lands did not cure any legal defects in the procedures followed by the
      Town to accomplish this purpose.</span></p>

      297(1)(c) and (d) conferred power upon a municipality to pass by-laws for
    “stopping up” any highway and for selling the freehold of a stopped-up highway.  In
    this case, the Town passed By-law No. 99-21 under the authority of s.&nbsp;297.  Under
    the by-law, the Town assumed the Lots as a public highway, declared the Lots “closed
    and stopped up”, and approved their conveyance to Dynasty.  But By-law No.
    99-21 pertained only to the Lots and not to Block “D”.  Thus, it did not
    operate to authorize the sale of Block “D” to Dynasty or to avoid the application
    of s.&nbsp;193 to that conveyance.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>And,
      as I have attempted to emphasize, the Town did not comply with the key
      requirements of s. 193.  In relation to Block “D”, the Town failed to pass
      a procedure by-law that provided for notice to the public of the intended
      sale of municipal land.  It also failed to declare Block “D” to be “surplus” at
      a meeting open to the public or to give notice to the public of the contemplated
      conveyance.  As a result, the Town’s conveyance of Block “D” is void.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      reach a similar conclusion concerning the Town’s sale of the Lots to Dynasty.  The
      requirements of ss. 193(2) and 193(4) were stated to apply to the “sale
      of real property”.  Highway lands were not exempt from the requirement
      under s. 193(2) to pass a procedure by-law that provided for the giving
      of notice to the public, nor from the requirement under s. 193(4)(c) that
      notice be given to the public of the proposed sale of municipal real property.  Thus,
      if s. 193 applied to the sale of the Lots, this conveyance is also void
      for non-compliance with that section.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    even if s. 193 did not apply to the conveyance of the Lots, the regime established
    by s. 297 and associated provisions of the Act pertaining to the stopping
    up and the sale of highway lands also imposed public notice requirements.  Section
    300(1) stipulated that at least four weeks notice of a proposed by-law for
    the stopping up or selling of a highway be published in accordance with specified
    procedures.  It also preserved the right of affected landowners to object
    to the passage of the proposed by-law, by requiring the council of the involved
    municipality to
    “hear” any person who claimed that his or her land would be prejudicially
    affected by the by-law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By-law
    No. 99-21 made no reference to any public notice having been given in respect
    of the assumption, closure and stopping up of the Lots or of the sale of
    the Lots to Dynasty.  To the contrary, it provided for the assumption of
    the Lots as a public highway (para. one) and their closure and stopping up
    (para. two), and then immediately went on to authorize the conveyance of
    the Lots to Dynasty (para. three).  This suggests that the Lots were assumed,
    closed and conveyed to Dynasty without any intervening public notice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, s.&nbsp;315(1) provided, with certain exceptions, that the sale
    of land constituting a highway or part of a highway over which a municipality
    had jurisdiction was to be carried out in accordance with s.&nbsp;315.  The
    preconditions to such a sale, as set out in s.&nbsp;315, included the requirement
    that the council of the relevant municipality set by by-law the sale price
    of the land to be sold and, further, that the land be offered for sale to
    the abutting landowner or landowners.  Section 315 thus established a right
    of first refusal in favour of abutting landowners whenever the sale of municipal
    lands constituting a highway or part of a highway was contemplated.  This
    required that notice of the proposed sale be given to abutting landowners.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There
      is nothing in By-law No. 99-21 to suggest that the Town set <i>by by-law</i> the
      sale price for the Lots.  To the contrary, By-law No. 99-21 did not mention
      any consideration for the conveyance of the Lots to Dynasty.  While this
      defect, by itself, may not have been fatal to the validity of the Town’s
      conveyance of the Lots to Dynasty (see for example, <i>Campitelli v. Ajax
      (Town)</i> (1999), 9 M.P.L.R. (3d) 35 (Ont. Sup. Ct. J.) at para. 19, aff’d
      [2000] O.J. No. 2587 (C.A.)), neither By-law No. 99-21 nor the record as
      a whole indicate that the Lots were offered for sale to any adjacent landowner
      other than Dynasty. </span></p>

      the end, I am satisfied that it is unnecessary in this case to decide whether
      s.&nbsp;193, rather than s. 297, applied to the Town’s sale of the Lots.  It
      is clear, at least, that ss. 300 and 315 of the Act applied to the conveyance
      of the Lots to Dynasty.  On the record before the application judge and
      this court, the Town did not comply with the public notice requirements
      of either s. 193 or ss. 300 and 315.  Accordingly, the Town’s sale of the
      Lots to Dynasty is void.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    reaching this conclusion, I recognize that the application judge stated in
    her reasons: “Nor have I been persuaded that there are other procedures,
    necessary to the integrity of a by-law passed for purposes addressed by s.&nbsp;297,
    with which the municipality failed to comply.”  However, it does not appear
    that the parties drew ss.&nbsp;300 and 315 to the attention of the application
    judge.  Her reasons make no mention of these sections.  Indeed, even before
    this court, neither party advanced any argument concerning the import of
    these sections until supplementary written submissions were invited by the
    court.  </p>

      was void by virtue of the Town’s non-compliance with s.&nbsp;193 and that
      this conveyance cannot be ‘sheltered’ under By-law No. 99-21 and s.&nbsp;297
      of the Act.  In addition, the Town’s sale of the Lots to Dynasty was void
      because the Town failed to provide public notice of the sale.  As a result,
