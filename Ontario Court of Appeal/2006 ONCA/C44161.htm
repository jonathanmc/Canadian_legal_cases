    to the remedy of subrogation and to recover from the proceeds realized by
    the interim receiver, RSM Richter Inc. (“Interim Receiver”) from the sale

    of the <i>Planning Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.13 it is invalid as is the
    Assignment of Rents, which was taken at the same time and is, by its terms, “additional

    One, Two and Three remained in the hands of the numbered companies (Parcel
    One in 1156712 and Parcels Two and Three in 882876). The development proposed
    a new grocery store building at the south end of Parcel One. The existing
    building (where Markets was then operating a grocery store) at the north
    end of Parcel One was to be leased to a bingo hall operator. Parking was

    agreement” or “MCA”). The MCA required that the existing first mortgage against
    Parcel One in favour of RBC be discharged from the loan proceeds. As the
    terms of the MCA required that the security for the loan be a first mortgage
    on the subject property, any other encumbrances which would otherwise rank

    May 26, 1999 and November 26, 1999 – were registered only against Parcel
    One, and thus were void under s. 50(3) of the <i>Planning Act. </i>RBC and
    Properties were unaware at the time that the mortgages were void. All parties
    to the mortgages had been represented throughout these transactions by the

    Charging Lands against Parcel’s One and Six. On August 18, 2002, it registered
    a caution against Parcels One and Three. The registrations coincided with
    BMO’s realization that RBC’s mortgage was defective, a fact still unknown
    to RBC. On August 23, 2002, the Interim Receiver was appointed. It was only
    after the appointment of the Interim Receiver that questions were raised

    brought an application to rectify the mortgages, so that they would charge

    the Interim Receiver were named as respondents to that application, which

    J. dismissed the application and, as a result, RBC’s mortgage against Parcel
    One remained void under the <i>Planning Act</i>. In his reasons, Abbey J.
    noted that in March 1999, at the time RBC agreed to advance the $2,300,000,
    there was no <i>Planning Act</i> violation. The pre-amalgamation corporation,
    1156712, owned only Parcel One and did not own abutting land at the time.
    The amalgamation that ultimately affected the validity of the mortgage was
    effected after the MCA was entered into but before the $2,300,000 RBC mortgage
    was registered. But for the amalgamation and the effect that triggered under
    the <i>Planning Act</i>, the registered mortgage would be valid.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[28]     The
    unsuccessful application for rectification of the mortgage brought by Mr.
    Slopen’s law firm was in the nature of a  “salvage” action to rectify the
    mortgage to reflect what was argued to be the parties’ intention. If rectification
    had been granted, RBC would have enjoyed a priority position and presumably
    the solicitor’s malpractice suit would be avoided. There was no need to raise
    any argument with respect to equitable principles or the doctrine of subrogation.</p>

    for both parties to the mortgage. Had the application been successful, the
    mortgage would no longer be in breach of the <i>Planning Act</i> and an action

    respondent does not contend that the cause of action is the same in both
    applications. Indeed, it is not. The respondent relies rather on a wider

    doctrine of <i>res judicata</i>, in its wider application, prevents a person
    from relying on a claim or defence which he or she had the opportunity of
    putting before the court in the earlier proceedings but failed to do so.
    This principle was adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Maynard v.

    in respect of a matter which might have been brought forward as part of the
    subject in contest, but which was not brought forward only because they have
    from negligence, inadvertence or even accident, omitted part of their case.
    The plea of <i>res judicata</i> applies, except in special cases, not only
    to points upon which the Court was actually required by the parties to form
    an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to every point which properly belonged

    had sought a declaration of possessory title to the same two-foot strip of
    land based on much the same evidence. In the circumstances, the court had
    no difficulty concluding that the second application was precluded by the
    doctrine of <i>res judicata</i>. The court noted, at p. 51:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            Upon
    careful review of the material filed in support of each application in this
    case, I am persuaded that the respondent’s position should be adopted. Although,
    in a strict legal sense, a different cause of action is advanced on this
    application, the appellant is in effect seeking an analogous remedy based
    on virtually identical facts. In each application, the appellant asserted
    a right to continue to use the two-foot strip of land on the respondent’s
    property as part of her driveway. It does not appear that it would make any
    practical difference to the appellant whether this right was asserted by
    way of possessory title or by way of prescriptive easement. On the facts
    as presented on the earlier application, it would have been open to advance
    not only the claim for possessory title but also, in the alternative, the
    claim to a prescriptive easement. In my view, the appellant’s second application
    falls clearly within the scope of the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> in
    its wider application.</p>

    believed that that mortgage had priority over its GSA and was not aware that
    there was any problem with the RBC mortgage. It advanced funds believing
    that its GSA ranked behind the RBC $2,300,000 mortgage. It was only after
    the companies fell into financial difficulty and the receiver appointed that
    a question was raised (by the Interim Receiver and not BMO) about the validity
    of RBC’s security in view of the apparent breach of the provisions of the <i>Planning
    Act</i>. Only after it became aware of the Elias financial difficulties.
    Thus, BMO was not in the position of a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value
    without notice as it did not give value for taking first place. It got what

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            The
    fundamental principle underlying the equitable doctrine of subrogation is
    one of fairness in light of all the circumstances. Within this principle
    is an understanding that no injustice is done by the appropriate subrogation
    of a party to the rights of original mortgages. Thus Street J. in <i>Brown
    v. McLean</i> (1889), 18 O.R. 533 (H.C.) at p. 536, stated:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>I think,
    however, that the plaintiff here is entitled upon the ground of mistake to
    be subrogated to the rights of the original mortgagees to the extent of allowing
    him a priority over the defendant for the amount he paid to discharge their
    mortgages. It is clear beyond question that he would not have discharged
    these mortgages had he been aware of the existence of the Defendant’s <i>fi
    fa.</i> He would either have refused to make the advance altogether, or he
    would have had the mortgages assigned to him instead of discharging them.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>            It
    is equally clear that the defendant has not been in any way prejudiced by
    what has happened, and that no injustice will be done by replacing him in
    his former position.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>….</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>This is because
    the equity of subrogation affixes to the land in relation to which the third
    party advanced the mortgage funds. Further, it is not determinative that
    the entire situation arises because of the negligence of the party claiming
    subrogation. … In fact, the doctrine is usually called into play because
    of a mistake or inadvertence. Accordingly, it is not enough to point to negligent
    conduct to defeat the doctrine’s application. The issue remains one of fairness
    between the affected parties having regard to all the circumstances.</p>

    doctrine of subrogation to recover monies advanced to pay municipal taxes
    and to discharge prior mortgages on Parcel One, all of which totalled $854,184.11.
    She concluded there was ample authority for the proposition that a mortgagee
    who pays off earlier encumbrances is entitled to the priority position of
    those earlier charges. She quoted from <i>Crosbie-Hill v. Sayer</i>, [1908]
    1 Ch. 866, as follows:</p>

    view, it would be simply unfair in the circumstances of this case to deny
    RBC its subrogation rights. BMO did not rely on the abstract of title to
    its detriment. Indeed, BMO was aware of the prior advances made by RBC and
    it assumed that RBC’s security was validly registered. This is made evident
    by the candid testimony of James Graham, a representative of BMO, during
    the course of his cross-examination. The transcript reveals the following
    questions and answers.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>58Q.    And
    you were aware of the mortgage financing that had been put in place before

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>125Q. And so
    Bank of Montreal knew that there were prior registrations including registrations
    in favour of Royal Bank, right?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That’s
    right.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>127Q. Now can
    we agree, Mr. Graham, that when the Bank of Montreal first lent its money
    to or granted demand loan facility to Elias it assumed that Royal Trust mortgage
    of 2.3 million dollars was validly registered?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    that’s right.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[48]     As
    a result, BMO made its lending decision knowing of RBCs prior registered
    interest. Presumably, it was content to rank behind the RBC mortgage of $2.3
    million. That was a business decision that it was entitled to make after
    weighing the relative risks and benefits.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[49]     BMO
    may suffer a loss but it seems to me that this was a risk undertaken by BMO
    in making the loan in question. Its loss is not, strictly speaking, caused
    by RBC’s right of subrogation, but rather by reason of the deficiency in
    the  value of the security and the underlying covenant. Moreover, to deny
    subrogation would give BMO an unanticipated windfall. BMO would be unjustly
    enriched ... In other words, BMO would receive the value of RBC’s advances
    totalling $854,184 which increased the equity in the property and it would
    be unjustly enriched as a result. This windfall is made more unfair because
    BMO only discovered that there might be a defect in RBC’s security in the
    spring of 2002, more than a year after its registrations under the PPSA.
    It was at that time that BMO took steps to register its GSA against Parcels
    1 and 3. BMO also registered its Notices of Agreement Charging Land and Caution
    in May, August and October 2002, all after it became aware of the potential
    defect in the RBC mortgage.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[50]     I pause
    here to note that RBC is entitled to subrogation not only for the mortgages
    that it retired but also for the City taxes it paid on behalf of the mortgagor.
    Authority for this is found in <i>Traders Realty Ltd. v. Huron Heights Shopping
    Plaza Ltd</i>., [1967] 64 D.L.R. (2d) 278 (H.C.J.) and the rationale is consistent
    with the reasoning expressed in the <i>Creditview</i> trilogy reviewed above.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[51]     Before
    leaving the subject, I should deal with BMO’s submissions on the issue. It
    asserts that the doctrine does not appear to have been applied to give a
    claimant priority over a creditor whose claim did not exist at the time of
    the payment or advance in question. I can see no reason, in principle, why
    subrogation should not apply in such a case, particularly where the subsequent
    creditor has not been misled or has not relied on an abstract of title to
    its detriment.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[52]     BMO
    asserts that subrogation cannot arise because the RBC mortgage was void.
    I disagree. Subrogation does not depend on the validity of the underlying
    registration but arises by virtue of the advance of funds to pay out prior
    encumbrances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with her reasoning. On the facts, there is no question that BMO assumed
    that RBC’s security had priority to the extent of $2,300,000 over its GSA.
    It made its loan to the companies on that basis and, at the time, had no
    basis to question the validity of the RBC mortgage. It advanced its funds
    on the assumption that the RBC mortgage was valid and had priority over the

      cross-appeal, RBC argues that it has a valid equitable mortgage for $2,300,000
      on Parcel One, which was created on March 26, 1999 when 1156712 accepted
      the terms of the RBC MCA dated March 15, 1999. When that equitable mortgage
      was created, title to Parcel One was in the name of 1156712, which owned
      no abutting land. Thus, RBC submits, there was no violation of the <i>Planning
      Act</i>. </span></p>

    motion judge rejected this argument. In reaching this conclusion, the motion
    judge relied on the decision of this court in <i>Tessis v. Scherer</i> (1982),
    32 O.R. (2d) 149, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [1982] 2 S.C.R. xi.
    In that case, a mortgagee sought to enforce a mortgage that had been made
    in violation of the <i>Planning Act</i>; the mortgagor owned abutting parcels
    of land at the time of the mortgage. This court concluded that the mortgage
    conveyed no interest as a result of this breach. It does not appear that
    an argument was made about whether the loan agreement between the parties
    created an equitable mortgage. </p>

      his decision, Sutherland J. carefully reviewed the law on equitable mortgages
      and concluded that an equitable mortgage had not arisen on the facts of
      that case. At para. 22, he wrote:  </span></p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>The highest interest in the land that can have been conferred on Tessis
      by the loan agreement is the right to an equitable mortgage after the required
      planning consent had been obtained. In no true sense of the term can Tessis
      be said to have had an equitable mortgage before that consent was obtained.
      This is not a case of a want of formalities in the mortgage document or
      a case of the refusal by the borrower to execute a mortgage. Although there
      undoubtedly was a mistake the usual equitable remedies are not available
      if to purport to make them available would be to contravene the statute.
      No equitable mortgage arises upon the entry into the loan agreement. To
      put the matter another way, in the absence of the required consent the
      loan agreement does not create an equitable mortgage any more than a legal
      mortgage document, correct in all its documentary formalities, creates
      a legal mortgage. At the material times, Tessis was not an equitable mortgagee.</span></p>

      a mortgage was duly prepared, executed and registered as the parties had
      agreed. The wrinkle was that no planning consent was obtained and the mortgage
      was void as a result. I agree … that an equitable mortgage cannot arise

lang=EN-US>An equitable mortgage therefore is a contract which creates in equity

  <p align=left style='

      that the mortgagor has not executed an instrument sufficient to transfer
      the legal estate. In the first case the mortgage, be it [ever] so formal,
      cannot be a legal mortgage; in the second case it is the informality of
      the mortgage which prevents it from being a legal mortgage. These alternatives

    charge with notice of RBC’s mortgage financing. In this context, it makes
    no difference that BMO was not aware of the equitable mortgage, given its

    noted by the motion judge, RBC was granted an Assignment of Rents by Properties,
    which was registered under both the <i>PPSA </i>and the<i> Land Titles Act. </i>RBC
    registered two Financing Change Statements under the <i>PPSA</i>. The first
    was dated April 7, 1998 and referred to an assignment of rents in respect
    of Parcel One. The second, dated August 31, 2000, referred to a general and
    specific assignment of rents.</p>

    conceded before the motion judge that the registration of the Assignment
    of Rents under the <i>Land Titles Act </i>was also void because of the <i>Planning
    Act</i> breach. It argued, however, that the registration under the <i>PPSA</i> remained
    valid and binding and took priority over any subsequent <i>PPSA </i>registrations,
    including those of BMO.</p>

    agree with the motion judge’s conclusion that the <i>PPSA</i> registrations
    are not inextricably bound to the Assignment of Rents. They are capable of
    existing independently, such that their valid registrations take priority
    over BMO’s GSA registered under the <i>PPSA</i> in 2001. The <i>PPSA </i>registrations
    and the Assignment of Rents evidence an interest in an income stream and,
    as a result, are not dependent on the validity of the underlying registration
    against title to the lands. RBC is entitled to the net rental proceeds.</p>

    the result, the appeal is dismissed and the cross-appeal is dismissed. Counsel
