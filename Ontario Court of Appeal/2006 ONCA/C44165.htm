      is an appeal from an order dismissing the appellant’s motion for an order
      annulling the respondent’s (“Robson”) discharge from bankruptcy.  The appellant,
      who had been Robson’s trustee in bankruptcy, alleged that Robson’s discharge
      was obtained by fraud and should be rescinded pursuant to s. 180(2) of
      the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3.  In support
      of the motion, the appellant relied on the reasons of Lax J. in an earlier
      proceeding involving the appellant and Robson.  The appellant contended
      that, in those proceedings, Lax J. had made a finding that Robson and another
      had engaged in an dishonest scheme to conceal assets from the respondent
      while Robson was an undischarged bankrupt.</span></p>

      motion judge was not satisfied that the findings of Lax J. necessarily

      deemed appropriate.   </span></p>

      a lawyer, filed an assignment in bankruptcy in July 1992.  The respondent
      was appointed trustee in the bankruptcy.  Robson received an absolute discharge
      from bankruptcy in May 1996.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      June 2000, the appellant commenced an action against Robson and others.  The
      appellant alleged that Robson had acquired rights in certain shares while
      he was an undischarged bankrupt and that the shares, and any income from
      those shares, vested in the appellant as trustee in bankruptcy as after
      acquired property.  Farley J. directed a trial of an issue.  The trial
      proceeded before Lax J.  </span></p>

      appellant was successful before Lax J.  She held that the appellant, as
      trustee, was the legal owner of the contested shares and that Robson and
      the other defendants were required to account to the appellant for all
      dividends and other payments, including interest received relating to the
      shares.  She directed a reference to determine the amount.  It was ultimately
      determined that Robson and others owed the appellant well in excess of
      $1,000,000.  Robson’s appeal from the order of Lax J. to this court was
      dismissed in October 2004.  </span></p>

      demonstrates that McLellan and Robson collaborated to attempt to conceal
      assets from the Trustee.</u>  There is no other explanation for the manner

      they have told, which in my opinion, were told to conceal the truth [emphasis

      Lax J. observed:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Robson and McLellan
    collaborated in a dishonest scheme to conceal Robson’s ownership in the shares,

      the motion to rescind Robson’s discharge, the appellant alleged that the
      respondent had obtained his discharge from bankruptcy by fraudulently concealing
      his ownership of the shares that had been the subject matter of the trial
      before Lax J.  The appellant relied exclusively on the reasons of Lax J.
      to support the allegation of fraud and did not place any evidence independent
      of those reasons before the motion judge to support the fraud allegations.</span></p>

      dismissing the motion to rescind Robson’s discharge, the motion judge said:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Fraud was not
    specifically in issue before Lax J. and while her findings are capable of
    that conclusion they are also capable of a conclusion that is short of fraud.  </p>

      I address the appellant’s submissions, I will dispose of one argument put
      forward by Robson.  He indicated that he intended to move to set aside
      the judgment of Lax J. on the basis that it had been obtained by fraud.  No
      such motion has been launched as of yet.  Robson’s intentions, whatever
      they may be, are irrelevant to the current validity of the order of Lax
      J.  It is a final and binding order.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Counsel
      for the appellant submits that the reasons of Lax J., read in their entirety,
      provide a clear and unequivocal finding of fraud upon the appellant as
      trustee by Robson while Robson was an undischarged bankrupt.  Although
      Robson does not accept the finding of Lax J., when pressed by this court,
      he could not offer any reasonable interpretation of her judgment other
      than that it constituted a finding of fraud.  With respect to the motion
      judge, I cannot interpret the finding of Lax J. as anything “short of fraud”.  I
      agree with the appellant’s contention that Lax J. made a finding that Robson
      had acted fraudulently when he failed to disclose his ownership of the
      shares to the trustee.  </span></p>

      Lax J. found that Robson had acted fraudulently, not every finding of fact
      made against a party in one proceeding is binding on that party in subsequent
      proceedings.  A party is bound by those findings which pursuant to issue
      estoppel or the related doctrine of abuse of process, the party is foreclosed
      from re-litigating in the subsequent litigation.  Issue estoppel was described
      in <i>McIntosh v. Parent</i>, [1924] 4 D.L.R. 420 at 422 (Ont. C.A.):</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>When a question

    as a ground of recovery, or as an answer to a claim set up, cannot be re-tried

    for a different cause of action. The right, question, or fact, once determined,
    must as between them, be taken to be conclusively established so long as

      Binnie J. described issue estoppel as applying to factual or legal questions
      that were “‘fundamental to the decision arrived at’ in the earlier proceeding.”  Later,
      at para. 54, Binnie J. put it this way:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The estoppel,
    in other words, extends to the issues of fact, law, and mixed fact and law
    that are necessarily bound up with the determination of that “issue” in the

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
      is evident from the relief sought and the facts pleaded in the proceedings
      before Lax J., those proceedings related exclusively to Robson’s ownership
      of the shares while an undischarged bankrupt.  Fraud was not pleaded either
      expressly or by implication.  Nor did the appellant’s right to the relief
      sought depend on whether Robson had acted fraudulently.  If Robson owned
      the shares at the relevant time, the appellants were entitled to the relief
      sought regardless of whether Robson had deliberately concealed his ownership
      of the shares from the trustee.  While it is clear that, by the end of
      the proceedings, the appellant claimed that Robson had dishonestly concealed
      his ownership of the shares from the appellant, the truth of that assertion
      was not “necessarily bound up” with the determination of Robson’s ownership
      of the shares.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It
      cannot be said that Robson and the appellant joined issue on the question
      of whether Robson had acted fraudulently in his dealings with the appellant
      prior to his discharge from bankruptcy.  Robson had no notice prior to
      the proceeding before Lax J. that the appellant would ask her to make a
      finding that Robson had acted fraudulently.  Robson chose to act for himself
      and he chose not to take part in the proceedings after the appellant’s
      case was completed.  He did not advance a defence or take part in the defence
      advanced by his co-defendants.  The finding of fraud made by Lax J. was
      based in no small measure on her assessment of the evidence led by the
      co-defendants.  It would be unfair to prevent Robson from litigating the
      fraud question in this proceeding based on a finding of fraud in a prior
      proceeding when he had no notice that fraud was an issue and did not participate
      in the part of the trial that was central to the trial judge’s finding
      of fraud.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      doctrine of issue estoppel does not reach the finding of fraud made against
      Robson by Lax J.  Consequently, the appellant cannot rely on that finding
      to establish fraud by Robson in these proceedings.  This conclusion does
      not prevent the appellant from attempting to establish by evidence that
      Robson acted fraudulently in his dealings with the trustee prior to his
      discharge.  This, of course, would require that the appellant launch a
      new motion to annul the discharge.  </span></p>

      should refer to one other matter raised on this appeal.  On May 2, 2006,
      a new bankruptcy order was made against Robson.  The appellant was the
      moving party, and the debt arising from the judgment of Lax J. was one
      of the primary debts relied upon in that proceeding.  </span></p>

      took the position that the bankruptcy order automatically stayed this appeal.  When
      questioned by the court, Robson could not identify any statutory provisions
      supporting his position.  Section 69.3 of the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency
      Act</i> provides that a bankruptcy order stays proceedings taken against
      the debtor “for the recovery of a claim provable in bankruptcy”.  This
      appeal does not involve the recovery of “a claim provable in bankruptcy” and
      is not stayed by the bankruptcy order of May 2, 2006.  </span></p>

      is not a case for costs against the appellant.  Robson represented himself.  His
      submissions were of no assistance.  There is no basis upon which this court

      favour of a self-represented litigant.</span></p>
