  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from convictions
    entered by Justice Ian M. Gordon of the Superior Court of Justice on charges of
    assault, aggravated assault and breach of probation.</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Boudreault appeals his convictions for assault and
    aggravated assault on two broad grounds.  First, he submits that the trial judge erred in applying a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning to a key defence witness.  Secondly, he contends the trial judge erred by failing to consider separately
    the evidence with respect to each of the two counts on the indictment.</p>
  <h3><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The <i>Vetrovec</i> Issue</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the trial judge applied a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning to the evidence of Richard Leeson, the key defence witness, by
    effectively directing himself that it would be dangerous to accept Mr. Leeson’s
    testimony in the absence of confirmatory evidence.  The Crown agrees that, if the trial judge applied a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning to the evidence of Mr. Leeson, this was an error in law.  However, the Crown asserts that, properly
    read, the trial judge’s reasons indicate that this did not occur.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We do not accept the Crown’s submission.  The trial judge was clearly entitled to
    approach Mr. Leeson’s evidence with caution, as is the case with any witness in
    appropriate circumstances.  With
    respect, however, it appears to us, from the trial judge’s reasons, that he
    felt a <i>Vetrovec</i> approach was appropriate with respect to a defence
    witness and, moreover, that he assessed Mr. Leeson’s evidence on the basis
    that, in the absence of confirmatory evidence – of which he could find none –
    the evidence was unreliable and could not raise a reasonable doubt.  This was at least perilously close to a <i>Vetrovec</i> application, which is not permitted in the context of defence evidence: <i>R v.
    Tzimopoulos</i> (1986), 29 C.C.C. (3d) 304 at 340 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R v. Chenier</i> (2006), 205 C.C.C. (3d) 333 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
  <h3><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
    Separate Counts Issue</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the appellant argues that the trial judge erred by
    failing to consider the evidence with respect to each of the two counts on the
    indictment separately.  We did not call
    on the Crown to respond to this ground of appeal.  In our view, the case was presented and argued on the basis that
    the identification of the appellant as the perpetrator of the offences was the
    only issue.  Moreover, it was the
    position of both the Crown and defence at trial that the same man attacked both
    victims.  Thus, once the identification
    issue was resolved, convictions followed on both counts.  We would not give effect to this ground of
    appeal.</p>
  <h3><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
    Proviso</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In spite of the trial judge’s approach to the defence evidence
    of Mr. Leeson through the lens of the <i>Vetrovec</i> decision, we are not
    persuaded that any substantial error or miscarriage of justice occurred in this
    case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This was a relatively strong Crown case.   One of the victims and an independent
    witness identified the appellant as the perpetrator and no witness placed Mr.
    Leeson – who came forward and said it was he who had committed the offences –
    in the Bar at the  relevant time.  The independent eyewitness knew both the
    appellant and Mr. Leeson.  He recognized
    the appellant in the Bar and he recalled words being spoken that implicated the
    appellant in the assaults.   The trial
    judge was alive to any discrepancies between the testimony of the independent
    eyewitness and the victims, addressed them appropriately, and came to the
    conclusion that they did not detract from the witness’ overall credibility,
    which he found compelling.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we are satisfied that the decision would not have
    been any different had the <i>Vetrovec</i> error not been made.  Therefore, we would apply the provisions of
    s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, although the appellant originally also appealed
    against the sentences imposed, the sentence appeal was not pursued in oral
    argument save on the basis that, if his conviction appeal was successful on one
    of the charges, his sentence should be reduced accordingly.  In light of our disposition of the conviction
    appeal, it is unnecessary to address this matter further.</p>
  <h3><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Disposition</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The conviction appeal is dismissed.  Leave to appeal sentence is granted, but the sentence appeal is
    dismissed as well.</p>
