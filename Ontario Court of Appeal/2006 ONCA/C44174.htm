  <h2>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is an appeal from the order of Rogin&nbsp;J. dated August&nbsp;24,&nbsp;2005,
    by which he dismissed the appellants’ counterclaim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    their counterclaim, the appellants allege that the respondents, who are solicitors,
    were negligent in drafting certain loan documents and in releasing certain
    security documents held in escrow.  The motion judge dismissed the counterclaim
    because he found the appellants were bound by a release they had executed
    in favour of the respondents.  At para.&nbsp;10 of the reasons, the motion
    judge observed “I can find no possible way that he can succeed in his claim
    against the lawyers because he signed the release.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    view the matter differently.  While the release contained the usual general
    language releasing the solicitors from “any and all actions”, neither the
    preparation of the loan documents nor the release of the security documents
    were among the items of work specifically listed in the release.  This is
    understandable as the release was executed in the context of a settlement
    of a dispute over legal fees in relation to other matters.  Only those other
    matters are specifically referred to in the release.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.&nbsp;Szemenyei
    filed an affidavit in support of the motion to dismiss the counterclaim.  In
    paragraph 23 of that affidavit, he deposes that “At the time of executing
    the full and final Release, Mr.&nbsp;Bartlett&nbsp;Jr. was fully aware of
    the problem between him and his father”.  However, there is nothing in that
    affidavit to suggest that Mr. Bartlett Jr. had any knowledge that he had
    a potential claim in negligence against the respondents in relation to the
    preparation of the loan documentation or the release of the security documents.  Indeed,
    there is no evidence to suggest that the facts underlying the claims of solicitor’s
    negligence were within the contemplation of the parties at the time the release
    was executed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    paragraphs 4 and 5 of the reasons, the motion judge appears to have recognized
    that a genuine issue for trial exists in relation to the release of the security
    documentation.  He stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[4] In addition despite the fact that Barlett Jr.
    asked Mr. Szemenyei for the shares, Mr. Szemenyei released them to him.  Mr.
    Szemenyei had been appointed the escrow agent by Bartlett Sr. and Jr.  If
    he knew of the dispute between father and son he may have been negligent
    in releasing the shares without advising Bartlett Jr. of the consequences
    of giving the shares to Bartlett Sr., and the possible effect on Jr.’s security.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[5] Depending on when Mr. Szemenyei learned of
    the dispute, there is a possibility that he was negligent in not providing
    that advice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is a conflict in the evidence regarding the factual matrix in which the release
    was negotiated and executed.  In light of that conflict in the evidence,
    there is a genuine issue for trial in relation to the scope and operation
    of the release.  In addition, the conflict in the evidence raises questions
    as to whether, even if the release is held to govern the matters covered
    by the counterclaim, the release was executed in circumstances of unconscionability
    such that it should be set aside.  That, too, is a genuine issue for trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge did not indicate the basis on which he made the order and dismissed
    the counterclaim.  It appears that he was acting pursuant either to rule&nbsp;20
    (summary judgment) or to rule&nbsp;21.01(3)(d) (frivolous and vexatious claims)
    of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>.  As we have found that the counterclaim
    must proceed to trial, we need not address the difficulty created for meaningful
    appellate review where the basis for an order and the law that was applied
    cannot be determined even after reference to the full record, including the
    motion material.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is allowed, the order below is set aside and the respondents’ motion
    is dismissed.  The respondents’ cross-appeal is dismissed without prejudice
    to the respondents to bring a further motion before the Superior Court of
    Justice for a stay of the counterclaim until the main action and counterclaim
    have been finally determined.  Costs to the appellants are fixed at $17,500,
    inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
