  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment
      of Justice David Little of the Superior Court of Justice dated September
      13, 2006.</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal arises from a claim for damages resulting from a fatal motor vehicle
    accident.  The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in finding that
    the respondent was entitled to claim damages as the deceased’s “spouse” within
    the meaning of the <i>Family Law Act</i> R.S.O. 1990 c. F-3, ss. 1 and 29.  The
    appellant also submits that the trial judge erred in failing to reduce the
    damages on account of various contingencies.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent and the deceased were not married.  There is no dispute, however,
    that they were cohabiting as spouses on the date of the accident.  The issue
    is whether they were cohabiting on May 6, 2000, three years before the accident,
    as required by s. 29.  Section 29 defines “spouse” to include couples who
    have
    “cohabited continuously for a period of not less than three years” and s.
    1(1) defines “cohabit” as “live together in a conjugal relationship, whether
    within or outside marriage”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    crucial finding of the trial judge was at paragraph 30 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The necessary
    intent to cohabit in a conjugal relationship was formed by the parties before
    May 6, 2000 although perhaps it was not documented until later.  Their relationship
    was an exclusive one, neither party being unfaithful.  They slept, shopped,
    gardened, cooked, cleaned, socialized, and lived together as a couple and
    were treated as such by their friends, family and neighbours.  While they
    may not have finalized any joint financial arrangements and continued to
    maintain separate residences, they lived together under the same roof.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that we should impose a bright line test and conclude that
    as the respondent had not “moved in” with the deceased as of May 6, they
    were not living together at that time.  We disagree.  In our view,
    “moving in” would add no precision to the meaning of “live together” and
    it would not provide the clear and definitive test sought by the appellant.  The
    case law recognizes that given the variety of relationships and living arrangements,
    a mechanical bright line test is simply not possible.  In our view, to accept
    the appellant’s argument would be inconsistent with the flexible approach
    taken by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>M. v. H</i>. [1999] 2 S.C.R. 3
    in this area.  We agree with the respondent that the jurisprudence interprets “live
    together in a conjugal relationship” as a unitary concept, and that the specific
    arrangements made for shelter are properly treated as only one of several
    factors in assessing whether or not the parties are cohabiting.  The fact
    that one party continues to maintain a separate residence does not preclude
    a finding that the parties are living together in a conjugal relationship:
    see <i>Molodowich v. Penttinen</i> (1980), 17 R.F.L. (2d) 376 (Ont. Dist.
    Ct.); <i>Thauvette v. Malyon</i>, [1996] O.J. No. 1356 (Ont. Ct. Gen. Div.); <i>Campell
    v. Szoke</i> [2003] O.J. No. 3471 (S.C.).</p>

line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the trial judge observed during the course of argument, the appellant led
    no evidence of the effect of various contingencies now advanced on appeal
    as grounds for reducing the damage assessment.  We see no error on the part
    of the trial judge in refusing to reduce the damages on account of these
    alleged contingencies.</p>

    the appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent fixed at $15,000 inclusive
  G.S.T. and disbursements. </p>
