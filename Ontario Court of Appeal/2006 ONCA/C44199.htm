      of Justice Cheryl LaFreniere of the Superior Court of Justice, dated August
      29, 2005</span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>.</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal cannot succeed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge erred in two respects: first, in failing
    to give sufficient weight to the status quo of de facto maternal custody
    and, second, in giving too much weight to s. 16(10) of the <i>Divorce Act</i>.
    We disagree. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    comprehensive reasons, the trial judge made factual findings about the mother’s
    conduct, which are not challenged on this appeal and which were amply supported
    by the evidence. She drew reasonable inferences from those findings and concluded
    that the appellant, while otherwise a good parent, was unable to support
    a relationship between the children and their father. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge was alert to the persistence of the mother’s conduct in attempting
    to alienate the father from the children. That troublesome conduct carried
    with it long term implications that were contrary to the best interests of
    the children. It included a broad range of behaviours, including such potentially
    serious behaviour as not telling the father about or giving him medications
    that were prescribed for the children. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    mother’s problematic conduct included the mother’s decision to move the children’s
    home to a different town on the eve of trial. As a result of that move, the
    children were uprooted from their school and their community. Moreover, the
    mother said that if the father moved to her new town, she would move again.
    This conduct, in addition to many other instances of alienating conduct,
    was properly viewed by the trial judge as evidence of the mother’s inability
    to support the father’s relationship with the children and to consider the
    best interests of the children. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    mother’s conduct persisted despite assessments and court orders stressing
    the importance of the relationship between the father and the children. As
    the trial judge noted, the mother is not persuaded by judgments of the court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    contrast, the father bonded closely with the children, took advantage of
    parenting courses, established himself as a capable and affectionate parent,
    participated fully in the children’s schooling and extra-curricular activities
    and, finally, appreciated the importance of facilitating a relationship between
    the mother and the children.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    recognize, as did the trial judge, that the remedy of granting custody to
    the father is a dramatic one. However, that remedy was supported by the expert
    evidence and by the mother’s persistent, ingrained and deep-rooted inability
    to support the children’s relationship with the father. We note that the
    trial judge carefully structured her order so that the children’s transition
    from primary residence with the mother to primary residence with the father
    would be gradual and cause as little disruption as possible for the children. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    this appeal was primarily fact driven and we see no error of law, the appeal
    must be dismissed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent is entitled to costs of the appeal, which we fix at $2,500.00,
    inclusive of disbursements and GST.  </p>
