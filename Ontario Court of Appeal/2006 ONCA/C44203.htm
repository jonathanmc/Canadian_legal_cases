    $97,800 per year and imputed income of the appellant of $25,000 per year.  The

    final order dated February&nbsp;18, 2003, made on consent, required the respondent
    father to pay spousal support of $2,200 per month to the appellant mother
    (the “Final Order”).  The quantum of spousal support was based on the respondent’s
    having an annual income of $96,000, of which $82,000 was his 2002 annual
    income from Ontario Hydro, where he works as an engineer, and the balance
    was self-employment income.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paragraph
    23 of the Final Order provides that spousal support is not reviewable before
    September&nbsp;2004:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>23.       Based on the applicant’s foregoing representations,
    the quantum of spousal support shall not be reviewable by the respondent
    until September 2004 in anticipation of the applicant’s graduation and possible
    employment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    representations referred to in para.&nbsp;23 are found in para.&nbsp;19,
    21 and 22 of the Final Order.  In essence, they refer to the parties’ agreement
    that the appellant would complete her training to become a nurse and become
    self&#8209;sufficient.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    October 27, 2004, the respondent brought a motion in which he sought to have
    the spousal support obligation reviewed.  He asked that the court impute
    income to the appellant and reduce the amount of spousal support he was to
    pay.  On December 20, 2004, the appellant responded with a motion in respect
    of other matters, including custody and child support.  Only spousal support
    is in issue in this appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant initially resisted the respondent’s motion on the basis that three
    matters precluded her completion of the nursing program:  health issues,
    childcare responsibilities and her obligations to care for her elderly parents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motions were scheduled to be heard by way of trial.  However, after various
    motions to strike the appellant’s pleadings for failure to produce OHIP summaries
    and other medical disclosure, the appellant agreed to take her health issues
    and responsibilities in respect of her parents “off the table”.  Following
    a further motion by the respondent, in an endorsement dated June&nbsp;22,
    2005, Rogers&nbsp;J. vacated the order for a trial on the basis that there
    were no credibility issues.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    previously stated, in the order appealed from, the motion judge reduced spousal
    support from $2,200 per month to $1,150 per month and to $600 per month when
    Ontario Hydro was on strike.  The motion judge noted in her reasons that
    the Ontario Hydro strike had “loomed many months before taking place, but
    the Respondent Father appears not to have provided for the potential problem”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her reasons, the motion judge states that it is
    “unfortunate” that the appellant withdrew from a reasonable educational plan
    when she was getting close to completion.  She also states that the appellant’s
    childcare responsibilities for the two children at home, aged 8 and 14 in
    2003, cannot explain the non-completion of her education and failure to obtain
    a job.  The motion judge refers to no other factors when setting the quantum
    of spousal support. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS </span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant deposed that she was unable to complete her nursing studies as
    a result of childcare responsibilities and the respondent’s refusal to assist
    her with the children.  Consequently, she says, she could not complete the
    clinical portions of her program which required early morning, shift and
    weekend work.  She maintains that she is essentially a single parent and
    that the respondent has little to do with the children.  One of the children,
    Daniel, is a goaltender on a Bantam A hockey team and has professional aspirations.  His
    hockey requirements lead to her having evening and weekend obligations.  He
    also has special needs due to speech difficulties.  The two younger children
    go to different schools and she must drive them each morning.  Evenings are
    taken up with preparing dinner for the children, hockey responsibilities
    and helping with homework.  The youngest child is too young to be left unsupervised.  She
    deposes that when married to the respondent, she had been able to maintain
    her nursing studies because the respondent helped with childcare responsibilities.  However,
    between changes to the nursing program following the parties’ separation
    and the respondent’s lack of assistance with the children, she was unable
    to complete the program.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Attached
    to the appellant’s affidavit of December 20, 2004, is a letter from her family
    physician that states that the appellant tried to attend nursing school but
    that between school and taking care of the children, her anxiety and depression
    worsened to the point that she was “overwhelmed” and
    “severely depressed”.  Attached to her affidavit dated August 4, 2005, is
    a letter from the Associate Dean of Nursing at Humber College dated June
    29, 2005.  In that letter, the Associate Dean says that the appellant tried
    to complete the program but that the clinical component of the program requires
    students to be on duty early in the day and involves shift and weekend work.  It
    says that due to lack of a support system, the appellant was forced to drop
    out of the program.  The letter concludes by saying that the appellant had
    done everything in her power to be successful and that those in the program
    had worked with her to try and resolve the problems that she faced.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also deposed that she had requested information from the respondent
    as to the contribution made by the respondent’s new spouse to the family
    expenses but he refused to disclose that information.  That information was
    said to be relevant particularly to the question of his ability to pay spousal
    support during a strike.  She also deposed that the respondent had refused
    to provide income tax returns which the appellant believes will show that
    he continues to earn substantial self-employment income.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent deposed that he understood that the appellant was going to complete
    the nursing program and that he had never been told otherwise.  He stated
    that the appellant gave him no notice of her intention to drop out of the
    nursing program and that she did not ask for any assistance so as to avoid
    having to take such a step.  He deposed that he did not believe that the
    appellant had used diligent and best efforts to complete the program and
    that the reasons given by the appellant for her inability to complete the
    program were simply a tactic.  He also deposed that, in view of the appellant’s
    lack of good faith in completing her studies, she should be treated as having
    finished the program and a level of income commensurate with her having obtained
    a position in the nursing field should be imputed to her.     </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS </span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    making the order under appeal, the only evidence before the motion judge
    were the competing affidavits of the parties.  There were no other affidavits
    and no cross-examinations on affidavits had been conducted.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    central issue raised by the respondent’s motion and considered by the motion
    judge was whether the appellant’s childcare responsibilities prevented her
    from completing her educational program.  The conclusions she reached reflect
    that the motion judge accepted the evidence of the respondent and rejected
    that of the appellant.  Given the competing positions of the parties, the
    motion judge’s conclusions could be reached only by deciding matters of credibility.  Although
    motions to change a final order or agreement can be dealt with by way of
    written materials, rule 15(13) of the <i>Family Law Rules</i>, O. Reg.&nbsp;114199,<i> </i>makes
    it clear that if a matter cannot be properly dealt with based on the filed
    material, a trial is warranted.<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a>   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, because of the need to make credibility findings on a significant
    matter in dispute and as the record contains only the competing affidavits
    of the two parties, the motion could not be properly decided without a trial.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
    spousal support could not be set absent a consideration of all of the relevant
    factors.  While the parties disagree as to whether the respondent’s motion
    should be decided as if it were a variation application or as an application
    in the first instance, they agree that all relevant factors, objectives,
    and circumstances must be considered when determining spousal support.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Moge
      v. Moge</i>, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 813, the Supreme Court of Canada makes clear
      that all of the four objectives in s. 15 of the <i>Divorce Act</i>, R.S.C.
      1985 (2d. Supp.), c. 3, must be considered when setting spousal support
      and that no single objective, including that of self-sufficiency, is paramount.  The
      majority also stressed the need to consider the impact of childcare responsibilities
      on the custodial parent saying, at para. 81:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If childcare responsibilities continue past the
    dissolution of the marriage, the existing disadvantages continue, only to
    be exacerbated by the need to accommodate and integrate those demands with
    the requirements of paid employment.  In that regard, I adopt without reservation
    the words of Bowman&nbsp;J. in <i>Brockie v. Brockie </i>(1987), 5 R.F.L.
    (3d) 440 (Man. Q.B.), aff’d (1987), 8 R.F.L. (3d) 302 (Man. C.A.), at pp.&nbsp;447&#8209;48:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndent-subquote>It must be recognized that there are numerous
    financial consequences accruing to a custodial parent, arising from the care
    of a child, which are not reflected in the direct costs of support of that
    child.  To be a custodial parent involves adoption of a lifestyle which,
    in ensuring the welfare and development of the child, places many limitations
    and burdens upon that parent.  A single person can live in any part of the
    city, can frequently share accommodation with relatives or friends, can live
    in a high&#8209;rise downtown or a house in the suburbs, can do shift work,
    can devote spare time as well as normal work days to the development of a
    career, can attend night school, and in general can live as and where he
    or she finds convenient.  A custodial parent, on the other hand, seldom finds
    friends or relatives who are anxious to share accommodation, must search
    long and carefully for accommodation suited to the needs of the young child,
    including play space, closeness to daycare, schools and recreational facilities,
    if finances do not permit ownership of a motor vehicle, then closeness to
    public transportation and shopping facilities is important.  A custodial
    parent is seldom free to accept shift work, is restricted in any overtime
    work by the daycare arrangements available, and must be prepared to give
    priority to the needs of a sick child over the demands of an employer.  After
    a full day’s work, the custodial parent faces a full range of homemaking
    responsibilities including cooking, cleaning and laundry, as well as the
    demands of the child himself for the parent’s attention.  Few indeed are
    the custodial parents with strength and endurance to meet all of these demands
    and still find time for night courses, career improvement or even a modest
    social life.  The financial consequences of all of these limitations and
    demands arising from the custody of the child are in addition to the direct
    costs of raising the child, and are, I believe, the factors to which the
    court is to give consideration under subs.&nbsp;7(b).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    note in this regard that the parties’ circumstances have changed since the
    time of the Final Order so that it cannot be assumed that the only factor
    that has changed is that relating to self-sufficiency.  Some of the changes
    which it seems apparent would impact on the quantum of spousal support include
    the following.  The appellant’s expenses are different.  She lost the home
    in which she and the children had been residing.  She says this occurred
    due to the respondent’s arrears of support.  She and the children now live
    in a home owned and paid for by her parents but for which she says she must
    pay rent, utilities and maintenance.  The oldest child has left home to attend
    university.  The middle child has achieved significant success in hockey
    with consequential changes in his need for parental and financial support.  The
    respondent has remarried and moved residence.  A number of changes appear
    to have occurred in respect of the respondent’s financial position including
    a significant increase in his employment income<a
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[3]</span></a> and
    the likely contribution towards family expenses that his new spouse may make,
    including during a strike at Ontario Hydro.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the circumstances of this case, a trial, preceded by full financial disclosure,
    is required.  At trial, the credibility issues can be resolved and a determination
    made on the issue of the appellant’s non-completion of her educational program.  That
    determination would then be one factor in the larger consideration necessary
    to set spousal support.    </p>
