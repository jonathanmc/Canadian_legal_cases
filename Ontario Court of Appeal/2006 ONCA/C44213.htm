      appellant, the Corporation of the Township of Southgate (“Southgate”),

      268(3)(c) of the <i>Municipal Act, 2001</i>, S.O. 2001, c. 25 (the “<i>Municipal

      its failure to give such notice prior to entering into an agreement of
      purchase and sale with the respondent, Stephen Doherty (“Doherty”), did
      not render the agreement void or unenforceable.  I agree with the decision

      the agreement if the charges were not reduced.  Southgate was not prepared
      to reduce the charges, however, it did agree to reduce the sale price to
      $120,000.  On November 26, 2003, Southgate’s council passed a resolution

      5, 2004.  By that date, Southgate still had not re-zoned the property as

      raised a number of defences to Doherty’s claim, including a plea that the
      zoning provision in the agreement was unenforceable because it fettered
      the legislative discretion  of Southgate.  In addition, Southgate took
      the position, for the first time, that the agreement of purchase and sale
      was void and unenforceable because Southgate had not given notice to the
      public of the proposed sale prior to entering into the agreement as required

      was not void or unenforceable because of Southgate’s failure to give notice
      to the public of the proposed sale prior to entering into the agreement

      268 of the <i>Municipal Act</i> sets out the procedure to be followed when
      a municipality intends to sell land that it owns.  The relevant subsections

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>268(1)  Every
    municipality and local board with authority to sell land shall pass a by-law

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>268(4)  The
    manner in which the municipality or local board carries out the sale of its
    land, if consistent with this section and with the by-law under subsection
    (1), is not open to review by any court if the municipality or local board
    may lawfully sell the property, the purchaser may lawfully buy it and the
    municipality or local board acted in good faith.</p>

      had complied with s. 268(1).  By-law No. 12-95 of the former Village of
      Dundalk was enacted pursuant to a predecessor section to s. 268(1) of the <i>Municipal
      Act</i> and established procedures governing the sale of land.  The wording
      of the by-law is similar but not identical to the requirements in s. 268(3)
      of the <i>Municipal Act</i>.  Southgate’s arguments before the motion judge
      and in this court were based only on an alleged contravention of s. 268(3)
      of the <i>Municipal Act</i> and not on the requirements set out in the
      by-law.  The difference in language between the two would not affect the
      outcome of this appeal and thus it is not necessary to consider the applicability

      then to s. 268(3) of the <i>Municipal Act</i>, the parties agree that Southgate
      complied with the requirements in paras. (a) and (b).  It passed a resolution
      declaring the property to be surplus and it obtained an appraisal of the
      property.  The only issue, therefore, relates to Southgate’s failure to

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      first question requires the interpretation of the requirement in s. 268(3)(c)
      that a municipality give notice to the public of the proposed sale prior
      to “selling any land”.  Does “selling any land” refer to entering into
      an agreement of purchase and sale, as is argued by Southgate, or does it
      refer to closing a sale by transferring title, as is argued by Doherty?</span></p>

      verb “sell” could refer to either one of the competing interpretations.  In
      support of his argument that “sell” refers to a completion of a sale, Doherty
      refers to the 6<sup>th</sup> edition of <i>Black’s Law Dictionary</i>,
      which defines “sell” to mean “dispose of by sale” or “transfer title or
      possession of property to another in exchange for valuable consideration”.  <i>Black’s</i> defines “disposal” to
      mean, <i>inter alia</i>, “to pass over into the control of someone else;

      the other hand, as Southgate argues, the verb “sell” is commonly used to
      describe the creation of a legal obligation to sell.  By way of example,
      when a land owner enters into an agreement to sell land, real estate signs
      and advertisements will frequently announce that the land has been sold,
      even before closing.  Once a vendor of land has bound itself by executing
      its acceptance of an offer to purchase, it has sold the land;  it cannot
      sell the land again.  </span></p>

      the phrase “Before selling any land” could reasonably refer to either one
      of the competing interpretations, the context in which the phrase is used
      and the purposes of s. 268(3) become very important in the interpretation
      exercise.</span></p>

      is significant that the phrase
    “Before selling any land” is contained in the preamble of s. 268(3), meaning
    that it applies to all three of the listed requirements.  Thus, it is useful
    to look at all three requirements to see if the intention is that they be
    completed before or after a municipality enters into an agreement of purchase
    and sale.   </span></p>

      makes sense that the requirement in para. (a) – that a municipality pass
      a resolution declaring the land to be sold surplus – be satisfied before
      a municipality enters into a binding agreement to sell the land.  Clearly,
      s. 268(3)(a) is intended to ensure that municipalities sell only surplus
      lands, that is lands that are no longer required for municipal purposes.  While
      it would be possible to interpret the requirement in para. (a) to be a
      condition subsequent to a binding agreement of purchase and sale, a requirement
      that a municipality make the determination that land is surplus before,
      not after, it commits itself to sell the land provides for a more orderly
      sale process.</span></p>

      makes even more sense that a municipality fulfil the second requirement
      in s. 268(3) – that it obtain an appraisal of the fair market value of
      the land to be sold – before it binds itself to sell the land.  The purpose
      of this requirement is obviously to help a municipality determine what
      would be an appropriate sale price.  It is logical that determination be
      made before the municipality offers land for sale and particularly before
      it enters into an agreement to sell the land for a specific price.  It
      would make little sense to obtain an appraisal after a municipality has
      already committed itself to selling at a sale price.  </span></p>

      also conclude that it makes more sense that the third requirement found
      in s. 268(3) – giving notice to the public of a proposed sale –  be satisfied
      before the municipality enters into an agreement to sell the land.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      argues that the purpose of this requirement is to provide the public with
      details of an already agreed upon sale to permit interested parties to
      take legal action to challenge the sale prior to completion.  Subsection
      268(4) contemplates a review by a court of the sale of land which, assuming
      a municipality has complied with s. 268(3), may be otherwise unlawful or
      based on a lack of good faith.  According to this argument, the notice
      to the public required by s. 268(3)(c) could provide the information necessary
      to bring this type of challenge.  As part of this argument, Doherty submits
      that the requirement of public notice is not to provide an opportunity
      for public participation in the internal review and approval process of
      the municipal council relating to the sale.  If the purpose of the notice
      had been to encourage public involvement, he argues, s. 268(3) would have
      included a provision requiring the holding of a formal hearing at which
      interested parties could make representations.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      do not accept this argument.  I think the preferable view is that that
      the purpose of the notice is to inform the public of a proposed sale before
      a municipality binds itself to sell land.  In this way, members of the
      public can, if they choose, make representations to their elected representatives
      that the land should not be sold because it is not surplus, or that the
      price being sought by the municipality is not sufficient.  Publication
      of notice of a proposed sale prior to a municipality entering into an agreement
      of purchase and sale provides an opportunity for members of the public
      who object to the sale to use political suasion to register their objection,
      as opposed to the more costly and difficult remedy of a court action that
      would be required if a municipality has already legally committed itself
      to sell the land.  Admittedly, the statute does not provide for a specific
      hearing process to receive such objections.  That, however, in my view,
      is not a reason to dismiss what is otherwise a reasonable purpose for the
      notice requirement.  The democratic process allows for political involvement
      by the public in both formal and informal ways.  Moreover, the requirement
      that a municipality give notice to the public prior to committing itself
      to a sale of land promotes, at least in a general sense, openness and transparency
      of municipal government, which can only be seen as a positive objective.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      caution, however, that the notice required by s. 268(3) need only indicate
      that the municipality intends to sell the land and the price at which it
      is offering it for sale – the same information that would be available
      to prospective purchasers.  The municipality need not include in the notice
      details of negotiations relating to the sale nor information about offers
      received.  If a municipality was required to include such information in
      a public notice, a prospective purchaser may be justifiably concerned about
      the integrity of the sale process and the potential for a municipality
      to shop its offer in order to obtain a higher price.  With this concern
      in mind, municipalities frequently consider offers to buy land in meetings
      that are not open to the public as Southgate did in this case.  Even without
      the details of negotiations or offers, the public notice of a proposed
      sale still serves the useful purpose of providing members of the public
      the opportunity to present their views about the sale of the land and its
      value in the political forum and to hold their municipal representative
      accountable through the political process.</span></p>

      summary, I am satisfied that the proper interpretation of s. 268(3) is
      that a municipality is required to fulfil the three requirements before
      entering into a binding agreement of purchase and sale.  Southgate failed
      to comply with the requirement to give public notice of its intent to sell
      the property before it entered into an agreement of purchase and sale with
      Doherty.  </span></p>

      my view, the answer to that question is in the negative.  Not every statutory
      breach results in a contract being void or unenforceable.  The decision
      of this court in <i>Beer v. Townsgate I Ltd.</i> (1997), 36 O.R. (3d) 136,
      is instructive.  </span></p>

      a developer of residential condominiums entered into a number of agreements

      Plan Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.31.  The developer had applied for registration
      and was subsequently granted registration.  The purchasers were at all
      times protected under the Act.  This court rejected an argument that<i> </i>the

      the breach of the statute at the time they were executed.  At page 144,

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I think it is
    significant that while the Act provides for a financial penalty for a breach
    of s. 6 it does not expressly provide that the contract so made is unenforceable.  If
    a statute does not expressly deprive a party of his or her rights under the
    contract, the question is whether, having regard to the purpose of the Act,
    and the circumstances under which the contract was made, and to be performed,
    it would be contrary to public policy to enforce it because of illegality:  see
    the judgment of Devlin L.J. in <i>St. John Shipping Corp. v. Joseph Rank

      are three reasons why I consider that it would not be contrary to public
      policy to conclude that the agreement of purchase and sale in this case

      with s. 268(3)(c) of the <i>Municipal Act</i>.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      as was the case in <i>Beer</i>, there is nothing in the statute under consideration,
      here the <i>Municipal Act</i>, expressly providing that a contract made

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
      there is nothing in the record to suggest that giving notice to the public
      of the proposed sale of the property to Doherty would have resulted in
      any different outcome.  No one, including Southgate, has suggested that
      the property was not surplus to the needs of the municipality.  On the
      contrary, Southgate has passed a resolution declaring it to be surplus.  Nor
      is there any suggestion that the sale price in the agreement of purchase
      and sale was in any way improvident.  Significantly, by the time Doherty
      agreed to buy the property, it had been on the market for close to a year.  The
      sale price was 72 percent of the value estimated by Southgate’s realtor
      and Southgate does not now take the position that it could have obtained
      any higher price.  On two occasions, Southgate’s council approved the sale
      and no ratepayers have challenged the sale.  Thus, it appears that even
      if Southgate had given notice to the public of the proposed sale, it would
      have ended up selling the property to Doherty on exactly the same terms
      as are in the agreement of purchase and sale. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third,
      Southgate’s position in this litigation with respect to the public notice
      is a disingenuous attempt to take advantage of its own failure.  Significantly,
      Southgate’s decision not to complete the sale on March 5, 2004 was based
      on its unwillingness to proceed with the zoning amendment called for in
      the agreement of purchase and sale and not on the fact that it had not
      given the public notice required by s. 268(3)(c).  Indeed, had Southgate
      taken that position prior to closing, it is fair to conclude that Doherty
      would have agreed to an extension of the closing date, if necessary, to
      permit such notice to be given.  While s. 268(3)(c) requires notice to
      the public before the municipality enters into an agreement to sell land,
      giving notice after the agreement was executed would still have provided
      an opportunity for the public to register any objections.  As I have said,
      I do not think that in this case it would have made any difference.  Be
      that as it may, Southgate did not raise the notice issue as a reason for
      not closing and first raised it in its statement of defence in an attempt
      to extricate itself from an action for breach of contract.</span></p>

      it may be said that Doherty should have been aware of Southgate’s obligation
      to give notice and its failure to do so, there is no evidence to suggest
      that he did not act in good faith throughout.  Doherty, through his lawyer,
      took steps necessary to prepare for a closing of the sale and Southgate’s
      actions would have led him to believe that Southgate had fulfilled all
      of the statutory requirements necessary to complete the transaction.  </span></p>

      that the agreement of purchase and sale in this case was not rendered void
