  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>BY THE COURT:</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Nature of Appeal  </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals the dismissal of its claims for inducing breach of contract
    and interference with economic relations and the consequent striking of the
    paragraphs related to these claims in its statement of claim without leave
    to amend.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, Enviro-Tex Products Inc. (“Enviro-Tex”), manufactures a product
    called rockwool for sale to hyrdroponic vegetable growers.  The respondent
    Devaere was an employee of the respondent MGS Horticultural Inc. (“MGS”),
    a competitor of the appellant.  The appellant alleges that on or about October
    15, 1999, the respondent Kelly Devaere (“Devaere”) told the appellant’s customers
    that EnerGro contained arsenic and could kill people.  As a result Enviro-Tex
    alleges that its customers cancelled their orders of EnerGro and additional
    sales have also been precluded. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    February 17,2005, the appellant claimed against the respondents for slander,
    malicious falsehood, inducement of breach of contract and interference with
    economic relations.  The appellant sought general damages of $5,000,000.00
    and punitive damages of $1,000,000.00, in addition to interest and costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents filed an amended statement of defence and crossclaim on May 13,
    2005 and then, on June 1, 2005, served a notice of motion, striking the appellant’s
    claim for slander on the basis that the two-year period for bringing such
    an action pursuant to the Limitations Act had expired.  The appellant agreed
    to withdraw its claim for slander.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    September 20, 2005, the respondents amended their notice of motion to argue
    that the two-year limitation period set out in s. 45(1)(i) of the <i>Limitations
    Act, </i>R.S.O. 1990, c. L.15, also applied to the three other causes of
    action pleaded – <i>i.e. </i>malicious falsehood, inducement of breach of
    contract and interference with economic relations pursuant to rules 20.01(3)-
    and sought an order for summary judgment dismissing the claims.  The respondents
    submitted that the other claims against them were in pith and substance an “action
    upon the case for words” and that they fell within the two-year limitation
    period in s. 45 (1)(i) of the <i>Limitations Act</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    noting that no special damages were claimed and rejecting the appellant’s
    argument that the claims fell within section 45(1)(g) of the <i>Limitations
    Act</i>, which permits an action “upon the case other than for slander” within
    six years, the motion judge agreed with the respondent’s contention and struck
    the claims.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a>  In
    other words, the motion judge held the claims in issue were really an attempt
    to dress up a slander claim and to do indirectly what they could not do directly.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our opinion the motion judge erred in holding that the actions for inducement
    of breach of contract and interference with economic relations were governed
    by the two&#8209;year limitation period for three reasons.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    an action in slander would not provide a remedy in damages to the appellant
    for economic loss to its commercial enterprise.  The appellant has provided
    particulars of its claim by listing the companies with whom it had orders
    and providing copies of the orders.  These particulars form part of the pleadings.  The
    fact that the appellant did not specifically plead that the appellant sustained
    specific losses due to the cancellation of the orders is a defect in the
    pleading that could be cured by granting leave to amend.  See e.g. <i>Haskett
    v. Equifax Canada Inc. </i>(2003), 63 O.R. (3d) 577,<i> </i>[2003] O.J. No.
    771 (C.A.), at para 58 where Feldman J. A. granted an opportunity to amend
    the pleading to properly plead the negligence claim.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    it is trite law that the same underlying set of facts may give rise to more
    than one cause of action.  Clearer wording than that contained in the statute
    would be required to bar any civil cause of action based on the words in
    issue here.  Indeed, the appellant is entitled to bring, as it has done,
    an action in defamation for the publication of these same words.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    there are no persuasive policy reasons that militate in favour of the action
    being struck at this stage.  The respondent submits that the appellant cannot
    do indirectly what it cannot do directly and, in support of its submission,
    it relies on the decision of this court in <i>Bai v. Sing Tao Daily Ltd.,
    I [2003] O.J. No. 1917 </i>(C.A.).  In that case, after the appellants’ claim
    for libel had been struck, McMurtry C.J.O. upheld an order striking out the
    appellants’ claims for “incitement of hatred”, “ crimes against humanity” and “ negligent
    research” as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. We agree with, and
    adopt the distinction made by McMahon J. in <i>Dundee Bancorp Inc. v. Fairvest
    Corp., </i>[2005] O.J. No. 2699, at para 52 that in <i>Bai</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    the plaintiff failed to seek any damages beyond those for loss of reputation.  That
    is not the situation here.  Insofar as the harm pleaded in this action clearly
    relates to the economic losses of a commercial enterprise, the appellant
    cannot be said to be doing indirectly what it cannot do directly.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, we therefore allow the appeal and set aside the order of the
    motion judge insofar as it dismisses the claims for inducement of breach
    of contract and interference with economic relations as well as the striking
    of the paragraphs related to those claims.  We further grant leave to the
    appellant to amend its statement of claim if so advised.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs
    of the motion are to the appellant fixed at $16,000 all inclusive.  Costs
    of the appeal fixed in the amount of $13,000 all inclusive are also awarded
    to the appellant.</p>
