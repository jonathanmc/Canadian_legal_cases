    Ontario Municipal Board (“OMB”) dismissed the appellants’
    objections to a licence being granted to the respondent Maurice Duval Excavation
    Inc. (“Duval Excavation”) to operate a sand pit on lands abutting the appellants’ property.  The
    sand pit would be approximately 600 metres from their home.  The appellants’ appeal
    to the Divisional Court was dismissed.  They now appeal to this court from
    that decision.</p>

    appellants maintain that, in considering whether a licence ought to be issued
    under the <i>Aggregate Resources Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. A8, the OMB had
    to have regard to several matters including “any planning and land use considerations”.<a href="#_ftn1"

    the local municipality;</p>
  <p>(b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>failing
    to recognize that the by-law of the local municipality was subordinate to

    to the extent that it did not comply with that official plan; and</p>
  <p>(c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>not
    having proper regard to the Provincial Policy Statement (1997) issued by

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, we dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Minister of Natural Resources referred objections to the proposed sand pit,
    including those made by the appellants, to the OMB for determination pursuant
    to s. 11(5) of the <i>Aggregate Resources Act</i>.  As found by the Divisional
    Court, we too are satisfied that the OMB properly carried out its assigned
    mandate.  It considered the evidence presented and materials filed that related
    to all of the matters it was required, pursuant to s. 12(1) of the <i>Aggregate
    Resources Act</i>, to take into account.  It then reached a reasonable decision
    based on the evidence presented.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    mentioned above, three specific issues were raised on this appeal.  The first
    is the proper interpretation of the by-law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    by-law in question was adopted by the local municipality in 1995.  It provides
    that the lands in question can be used for a sand pit.  The by-law does not
    stipulate any limit as to the size of the sand pit operation that can be
    established on the site.  The appellants submit, however, that the by-law
    is inconsistent with the official plan of the local municipality.  That official
    plan pre-dates the by-law.  It provides that the lands in question can be
    used as a sand pit but limits the pit operation to 15,000 tons per year without
    amendment of the official plan.   Duval Excavation’s proposed operation is
    for 40,000 tons per year.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, however, the inconsistency between the by-law and the local municipality’s
    official plan is resolved by reference to s. 24(4) of the <i>Planning Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. P.13.  This section provides that when a municipality adopts
    a by-law in a planning area “in which an official plan is in effect and,
    within the time limited for appeal no appeal is taken or an appeal is taken
    and the appeal is withdrawn or dismissed … the by-law shall be conclusively
    deemed to be in conformity with the official plan.”  In the present case,
    because the local municipality’s official plan was in existence at the time
    the by-law was adopted and no objection to the by-law was taken, the by-law
    is now conclusively deemed to be in conformity with the official plan.  This,
    in our view, means that the by-law is considered to be valid and operative
    according to its terms.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second issue raised by the appellants relates to the interplay between the
    by-law and the official plan of the upper tier municipality.  Subsequent
    to the adoption of the by-law by the municipality, an official plan was put
    into place by the upper tier municipality.  Duval Excavation acknowledges
    that this official plan does not provide that the land in question can, as
    proposed, be used as a sand pit.  Duval Excavation submits, however, that
    the by-law is the governing legislation.  The official plan is a planning
    document and, to the extent that it is not implemented by the municipality,
    it does not operate so as to limit the land use.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree.  The <i>Planning Act</i> provides for the amendment of by-laws so
    as to conform with the provisions of an official plan of an upper tier municipality.  Section
    27(1) of the <i>Planning Act</i> stipulates that a municipality “shall amend … every
    by-law … to conform with a plan that comes into effect as the official plan
    of the upper-tier municipality.”  Section 27(2) then provides that if the
    local municipality has not amended its by-laws to conform with the upper
    tier municipality’s official plan, the upper tier municipality
    “may amend the … zoning by-law … in the like manner and subject to the same
    requirements and procedures as the council that failed to make the amendment
    within the one-year period as required.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the present case, well over one year has elapsed from the adoption of the
    upper tier municipality’s official plan, and neither the local municipality
    nor the upper tier municipality have taken any steps to make the amendments
    as provided in s. 27(2).  In our view, absent an amendment to the by-law,
    the by-law remains in force and is not rendered inoperative or invalid.  The
    by-law still governs the permitted uses of lands within the municipality.  Specifically,
    a sand pit operation continues to be a permitted use for the land in question. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Significantly,
    s. 27(1) does not say that a non-conforming by-law is inoperative.  To the
    contrary, the scheme of the section implies that by-laws remain in force
    until amended.  This interpretation is reinforced by s. 27(4).  That subsection
    stipulates that, in the case of a conflict between an official plan of a
    lower tier municipality and an official plan of an upper tier municipality,
    the latter prevails.  If the legislature intended that the official plan
    of an upper tier municipality was to prevail over a by-law, it would have
    provided for it in drafting s. 27(4).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the third issue, the legislation then in force required the OMB
    to “give due regard” to the Provincial Policy Statement (1997).  This policy
    statement contains statements of policy with respect to mineral resources
    and natural heritage features.  The reasons of the OMB specifically state
    that it did have due regard to the Provincial Policy Statement.  In the circumstances
    of this case, we do not believe more was required.  As a result, we would
    not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    conclusion, we find that the OMB dealt with the issues correctly and gave
    comprehensive reasons.  It is apparent that it heard a good deal of evidence
    and considered all of the planning issues that were raised, specifically,
    the impact of the sand pit on the appellants’ property.  It concluded that: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[i]ssuance of
    the licence on the subject property would not generate unacceptable impacts
    on the objectors’ use of their lands with respect to dust, noise, visual
    impact and traffic provided that the proposed “Road Allowance Use and Maintenance
    Agreement” referred to above is entered into between the municipality and
    the proponent subject to the revisions suggested by the Board.  The Saïd
    property would be well buffered from the sand pit operation by the thick
    mature tree cover at the rear of the property and on the subject lands.  The
    sand pit use is a relatively quiet use and is a compatible use for a rural
    area and is considerably less noisy than a gravel pit, quarry or crushing
    operation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    findings of fact were not challenged and support the disposition made by
    the OMB.  Having found no error in the OMB’s interpretation of the by-law,
    official plan and the <i>Planning Act</i>, we agree with the Divisional Court’s
    decision and therefore dismiss the appeal with costs fixed at $15,000 inclusive
    of GST and disbursements.</p>
