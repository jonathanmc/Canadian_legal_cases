    respondent insured was injured in a car accident on April 7, 1999 and was
    eligible to receive statutory accident benefits from the appellant insurer
    under the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8 (the
    “Act”) and the <i>Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule – Accidents On or
    After November 1, 1996</i>, O. Reg. 403/96 (the “SABS”).<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a> In
    accordance with the SABS, he was assessed for catastrophic impairment at
    a Designated Assessment Centre (“CAT DAC”) where it was determined that he
    had suffered a catastrophic impairment in the accident and was therefore
    entitled to a higher level of certain benefits. In order to dispute this
    finding, the appellant insurer first initiated mediation in accordance with
    the Act. After the mediation failed, the insurer commenced an action for
    a declaration that the insured had not suffered a catastrophic impairment.
    The insured then brought a motion under Rule 21 to strike the insurer’s claim
    on the basis that the Act did not allow an insurer to bring such an action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue on the motion and on this appeal was whether the dispute resolution
    scheme in ss. 279-283 of the Act for the determination of entitlement to
    and the quantum of statutory accident benefits constitutes a complete code
    and, if so, how it operates, or whether beyond the express provisions of
    the Act, an insurer has the right to bring an action in the Superior Court
    to challenge a catastrophic impairment designation. The motion judge struck
    out the insurer’s action, holding that the provisions of the Act do form
    a complete code that does not give an insurer the ability to commence a court
    proceeding against an insured to challenge a CAT DAC. For the reasons that
    follow, I would dismiss the appeal. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    SABS governs the entitlement of an insured person to statutory accident benefits.
    Sections 279-283 of the Act provide the scheme for resolving disputes concerning
    that entitlement. One of the issues that an insured can raise is whether
    he or she suffered a “catastrophic impairment” as a result of the accident,
    entitling that insured to certain enhanced benefits. The respondent in this
    case claimed that he suffered catastrophic impairment as a result of his
    accident. Section 40 of the SABS, as it read prior to the 2006 amendments,
    provided the procedure when such a claim was made: </p>
  <p class=section-e><strong><span
lang=EN style='font-weight:normal'>40. </span></strong><span
lang=EN>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;An insured person who sustains an impairment as a result
      of an accident may apply to the insurer for a determination of whether
      the impairment is a catastrophic impairment. </span></p>
  <p class=subsection-e><span lang=EN>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;            (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      insurer shall, within 30 days after it receives the application,</span></p>
  <p class=clause-e><span lang=EN>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; determine that the impairment
      is a catastrophic impairment and give the insured person notice of the
      determination;</span></p>
  <p class=clause-e><span lang=EN>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; determine that the impairment
      is not a catastrophic impairment and give the insured person notice of
      the determination, including the reasons for the determination; or</span></p>
  <p class=clause-e><span lang=EN>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; give the insured person
      notice that the insurer requires the insured person to be assessed by a
      designated assessment centre in accordance with section 43.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=subsection-e><span
lang=EN>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the insured person receives a notice under clause (2)
      (b) and the insured person disputes the insurer’s determination, the insured
      person may require that he or she be assessed by a designated assessment
      centre in accordance with section 43.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=subsection-e><span
lang=EN>(3.1)&nbsp;&nbsp;[…]</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;'><span
lang=EN>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;The determination by the designated assessment centre
      is binding on the insured person and the insurer, subject to the determination
      of a dispute, in accordance with sections 279 to 283 of the <em>Insurance
      Act</em>, relating to whether the impairment is a catastrophic impairment.&nbsp;</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    subsection 40(4), the finding of the CAT DAC is binding on the insured and
    the insurer, but “subject to the determination of a dispute in accordance
    with sections 279 to 283 of the <i>Insurance Act</i> relating to whether
    the impairment is a catastrophic impairment.”
    Therefore, although the determination that the respondent suffered a catastrophic
    impairment as a result of the accident was binding on both parties, it was
    subject to resolution of a dispute under ss. 279-283 of the Act.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    key section of the Act is s. 281 which sets out the procedural and substantive
    requirements for dispute resolution: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>281. (1) Subject
    to subsection (2),</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    under section 282; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>(c) the insurer and the insured person may agree to submit any issue in
    dispute to any person for arbitration in accordance with the <i>Arbitration
    Act, 1991</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(2) No person
    may bring a proceeding in any court, refer the issues in dispute to an arbitrator
    under section 282 or agree to submit an issue for arbitration in accordance
    with the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991</i> unless mediation was sought, mediation
    failed and, if the issues in dispute were referred for an evaluation under
    section 280.1, the report of the person who performed the evaluation has
    been given to the parties.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(3) Subject
    to subsection (4), if mediation fails, the insurer shall pay statutory accident
    benefits in accordance with the last offer of settlement that it made before
    the failure until otherwise agreed by the parties or until otherwise ordered
    by a court, by an arbitrator acting under this Act or the <i>Arbitration
    Act, 1991</i> or by the Director.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(4) If a dispute
    involves a statutory accident benefit that the insurer is required to pay
    under subsection 268 (8) and no step authorized by subsection (1) has been
    taken within 45 days after the day mediation failed, the insurer shall pay
    the insured in accordance with the last offer made by the insurer before
    the failure until otherwise agreed by the parties or until otherwise ordered
    by a court, by an arbitrator acting under this Act or the <i>Arbitrations
    Act, 1991</i>, or by the Director.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(5) A step authorized
    by subsection (1) must be taken within two years after the insurer’s refusal
    to pay the benefit claimed or within such longer period as may be provided
    in the <i>Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule</i>. <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

    accordance with s. 281(2), the appellant insurer first requested mediation
    of the issue. However, eighteen days after the mediation failed to resolve
    the dispute, the appellant insurer commenced its action in the Superior Court
    for a declaration that the respondent insured had not suffered a catastrophic
    impairment. The respondent insured then moved under Rule 21 for an order
    dismissing the action as frivolous and vexatious because s. 281(1) of the
    Act does not give the insurer the option of initiating court proceedings. </p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>The Issue</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue raised by the insurer is best set out in paragraph 20 of the reasons
    of the motion judge: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The argument
    of the [insurer] is that the dispute resolution procedures outlined in sections
    279 - 283 must be interpreted in such a way as to provide a meaningful remedy
    for the insure[r] . In this case, the [insurer] submits that [it] should
    have the right to bring a proceeding in the court. To restrict the interpretation
    of section 281 so as to provide only the insured with the right to bring
    a proceeding in the court, results, in the submission of the [insurer], in
    an absurdity. The [insurer] submits that the consequences which result from
    such an interpretation is that all insurers in Ontario have rights under
    the <i>Insurance Act</i> and the <i>SABS</i> (in particular, sections 37
    and 40), but cannot enforce such rights. In effect, they have no remedy.
    This interpretation, from the viewpoint of the [insurer], is incompatible
    with both the object of the <i>Act </i>[and] with the object of the <i>SABS</i>. </p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>Analysis</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the insurer, that s. 40(4) of the SABS provides that the dispute
    resolution provisions of the Act are available to resolve a disagreement
    as to whether the insured was catastrophically impaired by the accident and
    therefore entitled to enhanced statutory accident benefits. The language
    of s. 37(5) of the SABS, dealing with income replacement, non-earner and
    caregiver benefits is even more clear that an insurer has the right to have
    a dispute resolved under the Act. It specifically provides that the insurer “may
    dispute” its obligation
    “in accordance with ss. 279 to 283 of the Act.” That subsection, as it read
    prior to the 2006 amendments, stated: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>37 (5) <i>The
      insurer may dispute the obligation </i>to pay a benefit in accordance with
      sections 279 to 283 of the Act and, pending the resolution of the dispute,
      the insurer shall pay the benefit if,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>(a) the person undergoes a designated assessment referred to in paragraph
    3 of subsection (3); and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>(b) the report from the designated assessment centre states that the person
    continues to have a disability that entitles the person to receive the benefit
    [Emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    also agree with the insurer that if the effect of the SABS is to make the
    decision of the CAT DAC binding and effective until the dispute resolution
    provisions of the Act have been used to change or confirm the result, then
    those provisions should be interpreted to give the insurer access to the
    dispute resolution regime.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent submits, to the contrary, that the wording of s. 281(1) is clear
    and unambiguous, and gives only to the insured the right to either go to
    court or to arbitration under the Act. The only option granted to an insurer
    is that it may agree to use private arbitration if the insured also agrees,
    but the insurer is given no unilateral right to initiate any court proceedings
    or arbitration under the Act. Therefore, the respondent says, the legislature
    intended that the insurer’s only right is to go to mediation, but if mediation
    fails, and if the insured does not initiate court action or arbitration under
    the Act or agree to private arbitration, then the determination by the CAT
    DAC remains binding. The motion judge accepted this submission, concluding
    at para. 30:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The <i>Insurance
      Act</i> sets up a complete code to deal with catastrophic impairment issues,
      including a dispute mechanism. It is not absurd to suggest that an insurer
      should be bound by the findings of an independent DAC as to whether an
      insured person meets the test of catastrophic impairment. The rights of
      an insurer are indeed restricted by sections 279-283, but this is what
      the Legislature intended. Simply put, the CAT DAC finding is binding on
      the insurer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the motion judge, in my view it was not the intent of the legislature
    that an insurer would be forever bound by a CAT DAC that is favourable to
    the insured, and that the dispute resolution mechanism is only available
    to an insured who wishes to dispute an unfavourable CAT DAC finding. Rather
    ss. 281(3) and (4) disclose the full operation and effect of the dispute
    resolution scheme and how it is intended by the legislature to operate so
    that an insured maintains control of the process, but the insurer is still
    protected. The effect of ss. 281(3) and (4) is to put the onus on the insured
    to follow through with the dispute resolution process after a failed mediation
    in order to obtain any benefits he or she would be entitled to as a result
    of the contested CAT DAC. Subsections 281(3) and (4) and s. 268(8) provide: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>281. (3) Subject
    to subsection (4), if mediation fails, the insurer shall pay statutory accident
    benefits in accordance with the last offer of settlement that it made before
    the failure until otherwise agreed by the parties or until otherwise ordered
    by a court, by an arbitrator acting under this Act or the <i>Arbitration
    Act, 1991</i> or by the Director.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(4) If a dispute
    involves a statutory accident benefit that the insurer is required to pay
    under subsection 268 (8) and no step authorized by subsection (1) has been
    taken within 45 days after the day mediation failed, the insurer shall pay
    the insured in accordance with the last offer made by the insurer before
    the failure until otherwise agreed by the parties or until otherwise ordered
    by a court, by an arbitrator acting under this Act or the <i>Arbitration

    the Act; therefore s. 281(4) is not applicable. However, s. 281(3) does apply. </p>

    of the SABS, is that although the CAT DAC finding is binding on both parties,
    if the insurer seeks mediation pursuant s. 280 of the Act and the mediation
    fails, the insurer need only pay benefits in accordance with the last offer
    of settlement it made before the failed mediation, until the parties agree
    or until a court, an arbitrator, or the Director on appeal from the arbitrator
    under the Act, orders otherwise. </p>

line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
    the onus is always on the insured to initiate dispute resolution after a
    failed mediation in order to seek any additional benefits that may be warranted
    by the CAT DAC. If the insured does not act, the insurer will only pay benefits
    in the amount at which it was prepared to settle. The insurer is thereby
    protected and need not pay the additional benefits to which it objects unless
    so ordered through the dispute resolution scheme. The insured is similarly
    protected as it has the right, pursuant to s. 281(1), to commence litigation
    or arbitration to try to obtain the benefit of a favourable CAT DAC finding. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    leaving the choice of forum always with the insured, the legislature has
    guaranteed that the insured maintains control of the process including its
    timing and cost. See <i>Baron v. Kingsway General Insurance Co.</i> (2006),
    35 C.C.L.I. (4th) 180 (Sup. Ct.) at para. 29. Arbitration under the Act is
    an expeditious and much less costly process than a court action, but the
    court option is open to an insured. At the same time, s. 281(5) (now s. 281.1),
    protects the insurer from any undue delay by the insured in initiating dispute
    resolution, by providing a two-year limitation (subject to the SABS) following
    an insurer’s refusal to pay a claimed benefit, for a step to be taken under
    s. 281(1).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    result is that when s. 281 is read in its entirety, it is evident that the
    insurer is not left without a remedy when it wishes to dispute the finding
    of the CAT DAC. It is given a remedy by the operation of the provisions:
    if an insurer wishes to dispute a CAT DAC finding, it can commence mediation.
    If mediation has been tried and failed, the insurer can revert to paying
    only what it was willing to settle for, until there is an agreement or an
    order directing a different amount. As a result, an insured cannot, in effect,
    allow the mediation to fail, then claim that the CAT DAC finding is binding
    on the insurer and take no further action. Rather, the insured would be obliged
    to use its right in s. 281 to initiate court or arbitration proceedings or
    to agree to private arbitration in order to seek to obtain the higher benefits
    that are available to a person with a catastrophic impairment. </p>

line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the other hand, insurers should not view ss. 281(3) and (4) as an invitation
    to make an unreasonably low offer to settle in order to pay only that amount
    until the dispute is resolved. In <i>Samoila v. Prudential of America General
    Insurance Co.</i>, [1999] O.J. No. 2317 (Sup. Ct.) the insurer had made an
    offer of zero before mediation failed. On an interlocutory motion in the
    proceedings, Zalev J. exercised the power granted in s. 281(3) to order a
    higher amount. At paras. 25-27, he stated:<i></i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Under s. 281
    of the Insurance Act if mediation fails an insured is allowed to sue in a
    court of competent jurisdiction, refer the issues in dispute to an arbitrator
    under s. 282 or with the agreement of the insurer submit any issue in dispute
    to any person for arbitration. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Section 281(3)
    provides that if mediation fails, the insurer shall pay statutory accident
    benefits in accord with the last offer of settlement that it had before the
    failure until otherwise agreed by the parties or otherwise ordered by a court
    or by an arbitrator acting under the Insurance Act or the Arbitration Act. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Prudential takes
    the position that even if the plaintiff is successful on this motion it is
    not required to pay anything further as its last offer of settlement before
    mediation failed was zero. To give effect to this argument would be an invitation
    to other insurers to torpedo any mediation by offering zero as their last
    offer in the hope that this would circumvent their obligation to pay full
    interim benefits under s. 268(8) of the Insurance Act and the Statutory Accident
    Benefits Schedule. Fortunately for every insured the Legislature has given
    the court or an arbitrator power to order otherwise, and I am prepared to
    do so. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, I conclude that there is no need or basis for the court to read
    into the Act a right for insurers to initiate court action or to find that
    the language of s. 281 is not sufficient to remove any common law right that
    an insurer may have had to bring such an action. It is clear that the provisions
    of ss. 279 to 283 of the Act were intended to and do form a complete code
    for dispute resolution, which can work effectively and fairly for all parties.</p>

    leaving the analysis of these provisions, I wish to address and acknowledge
    some of the jurisprudence that has discussed the issue of whether an insurer
    can initiate a civil action under s. 281(1). Historically, arbitrators under
    the Act have accepted that after a failed mediation, an insurer does have
    the right to commence an action in order to obtain a resolution of a statutory
    accident benefits entitlement dispute. See, for example, <i>Decicco v. State
    Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.,</i> [1991] O.I.C.D. No. 11; <i>Gouliaeff
    v. Commercial Union Assurance Co. of Canada</i>, 1993 CarswellOnt 4758 (O.I.C.); <i>Adusei
    v. Royal Insurance Co. of Canada</i>, [1994] O.I.C.D. No. 21; <i>Miller v.
    Allstate Insurance Co. of Canada</i>, [1999] O.F.S.C.I.D. No. 77 (F.S.C.O.
    Arb.); <i>Mangat v. Non-Marine Underwriters, Lloyd’s London</i>, 2000 CarswellOnt
    5679 (F.S.C.O. Appeal); <i>D. (M.) v. Halifax Insurance Co.</i>, 2001 CarswellOnt
    5152 (F.S.C.O. Appeal); <i>Sellathamby v. Allstate Insurance Co. of Canada</i>,
    2002 CarswellOnt 4905 at paras. 44-45 (F.S.C.O. Arb.), aff’d 2002 CarswellOnt

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    example, in the early arbitration decision in <i>Decicco</i>, <i>supra</i>,<i> </i>the
    issue was whether in an arbitration initiated by an insured, the arbitrator
    could also address issues that the insurer wished to raise. It was in that
    context that the arbitrator stated that nothing in the Act removed an insurer’s
    common law right to have issues resolved by a court. She reasoned that so
    long as the issues had first been mediated, it made sense to allow the insurer’s
    issues to be decided in the ongoing arbitration rather than force the insurer
    to bring a separate proceeding in court, with the attendant extra cost and
    risk of inconsistent results. In 1996, s. 282(3) of the Act was amended to
    specifically provide that the arbitrator is to decide all issues in a dispute
    whether raised by the insured or the insurer. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Much
    of the arbitral jurisprudence that states that the Act does not remove an
    insurer’s right to bring a court action to decide disputes regarding statutory
    accident entitlement relies on the 1992 Superior Court decision in <i>Citadel
    General Assurance Co. v. Gogna</i>, [1992] I.L.R. 1-2891 (Ont. Ct. Gen. Div.).
    The issue in that case was whether an insurer’s civil action for the repayment
    of benefits allegedly obtained by the insured by fraud and misrepresentation
    could proceed notwithstanding the insured person’s subsequent application
    for arbitration. In that context, the court held that an insurer must have
    access to the courts to enforce repayment by an insured of benefits obtained
    by fraud or misrepresentation and that nothing in the Act specifically removed
    an insurer’s common law right to obtain that enforcement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Arbitrators
    in subsequent cases have stated that <i>Citadel </i>sets out the appropriate
    approach for determining which proceeding should continue when the parties
    each want to proceed in different forums. However, the actual issue in those
    arbitration cases was how to proceed when the <i>insured</i> had commenced
    multiple proceedings (see, for example, <i>Mangat </i>and<i> Gouliaeff, supra</i>),
    not whether an insurer can commence a civil action. In that context, and
    in others, arbitrators have noted that insured persons have been given a
    choice under the Act, not available to insurers, of whether to proceed by
    way of arbitration or litigation. Arbitrators have then commented, in <i>obiter</i>,
    that the only option for insurers after a failed mediation is to proceed
    by way of court action. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, court access for the purpose of obtaining repayment of funds obtained
    in error or by fraud or misrepresentation is not limited by the scheme for
    resolution of disputes related to an insured person’s entitlement to or the
    quantum of statutory accident benefits contained in ss. 279-283 of the Act. <i>Citadel</i> should
    therefore be distinguished from the present appeal. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Citadel</i>,
    the court stated that, “at common law an insurer has a right of action for
    repayment of amounts paid to a person through error or fraud”, and found
    that the common law right was not expressly or impliedly removed by the dispute
    resolution provisions of the Act. <b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    unlike the right to redress for fraud or misrepresentation, a catastrophic
    impairment designation is a statutory, not a common law creation. Also, s.&nbsp;27
    of the former <i>No-Fault Benefits Schedule</i> (now s. 47 of the SABS),
    which obliged an insured to repay any benefits that were paid through fraud
    or error,<span
class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a></span> differed from ss. 37(5) and 40(4) of
    the SABS because it did not address the procedure for dispute resolution,
    while ss. 37(5) and 40(4) specifically limit the availability of dispute
    resolution for statutory accident benefits entitlement to the procedures
    set out in ss. 279-283 of the Act. Of course, those sections do not include
    any right of an insurer to initiate a court proceeding. <b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the reasoning in <i>Citadel</i> must be limited to actions involving
    the repayment of benefits obtained through fraud or error; to extrapolate
    from that case that insurers also have an absolute right to bring a court
    proceeding to determine statutory accident benefits entitlement issues is
    erroneous. <b><i></i></b></p>

line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    one analysis that has been made to support the suggestion that s. 281(1)
    contemplates (although it does not provide) that an insurer is entitled to
    initiate court proceedings is the wording in s. 281(2) that states that “no
    person” shall commence court proceedings or arbitration or agree to private
    arbitration without first going to mediation (see, for example, <i>Decicco</i>, <i>supra</i>).
    The argument is made that the words “no person” indicate that persons other
    than an insured can bring court proceedings, and that otherwise, the legislature
    would have said “no insured”
    shall commence, etc. I see no merit in this argument. The phrase “no person” in
    s. 281(2) is used to preclude both insureds who bring court or arbitral proceedings
    as well as insureds <i>and insurers</i> who agree to private arbitration,
    from commencing any proceeding without first attempting mediation.<i></i></p>

    conclude that although there is historical arbitral and judicial case law<a href="#_ftn4"

    suggests that an insurer may have the right to commence a court proceeding
    to determine statutory accident benefits entitlement issues, when that case
    law is read in its proper context, it is apparent that it evolved without
    consideration of the entire legislative scheme provided in s. 281. As discussed
    above, once the entire scheme is considered, it is clear that insurers are
    not left without a remedy to ensure that statutory accident benefits entitlement
    issues are adjudicated following a CAT DAC. There is therefore no need to
    read into the legislation a court remedy for insurers that is not provided
    by the legislation.<i></i></p>
