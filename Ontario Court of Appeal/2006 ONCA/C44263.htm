      entered by Justice Thomas M. Dunn of the Superior Court of Justice sitting

      Dunn on September 12, 2005</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>.</span></h4>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    a jury trial the appellant was convicted of importing 2.97 kilograms of cocaine
    into Canada. She was subsequently sentenced to seven years imprisonment.
    The appellant raises two issues on appeal concerning the jury selection process.
    She also seeks leave to appeal sentence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the trial judge did not improperly restrict the <i>Parks</i><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a><i> </i>question that could be asked
    on the challenge for cause by eliminating the attitudinal component of the
    question. During the colloquy concerning defence counsel’s application to
    modify the <i>Parks</i> question, the trial judge stated that defence counsel
    could put the <i>Parks </i>question in this way: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As His Honour will tell you, you must decide this
    case without bias, prejudice or partiality. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Would your ability to judge the evidence of this
    case be affected by the fact that the accused is black. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, in making the above comments, the trial judge was not restricting
    defence counsel from asking the <i>Parks</i> question precisely as it is
    framed in the <i>Parks</i> decision. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    even assuming that the trial judge intended to eliminate any reference to
    the words “without bias, prejudice or partiality”
    from the second part of the question, he did not thereby eliminate the attitudinal
    component of the <i>Parks</i> inquiry. The permitted question directs a prospective
    juror’s attention to the duty of a juror to decide the case without bias,
    prejudice or partiality and, in that context, asks whether the prospective
    juror’s ability to judge the case would be affected by the fact that the
    accused is black. Viewed in its entirety, we are satisfied that this question
    encompasses both the attitudinal and the behavioural components of the <i>Parks</i> inquiry. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    reject the appellant’s submission that the trial judge misdirected the triers
    as to their ultimate function in deciding the challenge for cause. Reading
    the trial judge’s instructions as a whole, we are satisfied that there was
    no realistic possibility that the triers would have been misled into thinking
    that their function was to determine whether the evidence provided by a potential
    juror <i>would assist counsel</i> in determining the issue of partiality.
    Rather, it would have been clear to the triers that it was <i>their</i> function
    to determine the issue of partiality.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    conviction appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning
    to the sentence appeal, in our view, the trial judge erred in principle by
    failing to give the appellant any credit for her cooperation in providing
    information to the police. In particular, the appellant provided the police
    with the first name, description and telephone number of the person she alleged
    sent her to Curacao and who was to receive the bag containing the drugs.
    The appellant cannot be faulted for the information not having led to an
    arrest, as the police took no steps to follow up on the telephone number
    that was provided. In sentencing submissions at trial, the Crown agreed that
    the appellant should receive one year of credit for her cooperation. In these
    circumstances, we consider that the trial judge erred by failing to give
    the appellant any credit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taking
    account of the appellant’s circumstances and the circumstances of the offence,
    we would substitute a sentence of six years imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    leave to appeal sentence is granted, the sentence appeal is allowed, the
    sentence imposed by the trial judge is set aside and a sentence of six years
    imprisonment is substituted.</p>
