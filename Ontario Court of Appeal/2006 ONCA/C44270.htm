  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the order of
      Justice Harry J. Keenan of the Superior Court of Justice, dated September
      16, 2005 made at Barrie, Ontario.</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>LASKIN J.A.:</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>A. INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>     This appeal concerns
    the validity of a notice of discontinuance filed by the plaintiffs and the
    plaintiffs’ right to add a party after the expiry of a limitation period. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>     On July 14, 2002,
    the plaintiff Vera Burtch was severely injured in a car accident on Highway
    118 in the District Municipality of Muskoka (“Muskoka”). The plaintiffs issued
    a notice of action naming several defendants, including Muskoka. The notice
    of action was issued on October 8, 2002, within the three-month limitation
    period then applicable for suing a municipality for failing to maintain or
    repair a highway. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>     On November 5,
    2002, the plaintiffs filed a statement of claim naming Muskoka as a defendant.
    However, simultaneously with its filing, the plaintiffs filed a notice of
    discontinuance against Muskoka.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>     In February 2004,
    nineteen months after the accident, two of the defendants issued a third-party
    claim against Muskoka. In March 2005, nearly three years after the accident,
    the plaintiffs brought a motion for a declaration that their notice of discontinuance
    was invalid or for an order that Muskoka be added as a defendant in the action.
    The plaintiffs contended that they had recently discovered that a dangerous
    shoulder drop-off, which Muskoka had failed to repair, had contributed to
    the accident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>     By an order dated
    September 16, 2005, Keenan J. granted the relief sought by the plaintiffs.
    He declared that the plaintiffs did not discontinue their action against
    Muskoka because their notice did not comply with rule 23.01 of the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194. Alternatively, he granted
    the plaintiffs leave to amend their statement of claim to add Muskoka as
    a defendant. He did so on the ground that the plaintiffs’ cause of action
    was not “discoverable” until well after the expiry of the limitation period.
    The motion judge, however, did give Muskoka the right to plead and rely on
    the limitation period in its statement of defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>     Muskoka appeals.
    Its appeal raises two main issues: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1) Did the motion judge err in concluding that
    the notice of discontinuance was invalid for failure to comply with rule
    23.01?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) Did the motion judge err in applying the discoverability
    principle to postpone the running of the limitation period? Related to the
    second issue are questions about the effect of the motion judge’s order adding
    Muskoka as a defendant, and whether that order is final or interlocutory. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I have concluded that the notice of discontinuance
    was valid, but that the motion judge did not commit a reviewable error in
    permitting the plaintiffs to add Muskoka as a defendant. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>B. DISCUSSION</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>First Issue: Did the motion
      judge err in concluding that the notice of discontinuance was invalid?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      plaintiffs filed both their statement of claim and their notice of discontinuance
      against Muskoka and others on November 5, 2002. The motion judge held that
      the notice of discontinuance did not validly discontinue the action against
      Muskoka, because the plaintiffs did not meet two of the requirements of
      rule 23.01: they did not serve the notice of discontinuance on Muskoka,
      and, though they filed the notice with the court, they did not file proof
      of service. In my view, neither requirement relied on by the motion judge
      invalidated the notice. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Rule
      23.01 states:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>A plaintiff may discontinue all or
      part of an action against any defendant,</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>(a)</span><span lang=EN> before the
      close of pleadings, by serving on all parties who have been served with
      the statement of claim a notice of discontinuance (Form 23A) and filing
      the notice with proof of service;</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)<span lang=EN> after the close of pleadings,
      with leave of the court; or</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)<span lang=EN> at any time, by filing the consent
      of all parties.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Under
      rule 23.01(a), before the close of pleadings, a plaintiff is entitled to
      discontinue an action against a defendant by filing a notice. In this case,
      pleadings had not been closed, so the plaintiffs were entitled to discontinue.
      They served their notice of discontinuance on the other defendants but
      not on Muskoka. However, rule 23.01 states that only a party served with
      a statement of claim has to be served with a notice. The plaintiffs did
      not serve Muskoka with a statement of claim. Therefore, they were not required
      to serve Muskoka with the notice of discontinuance. The motion judge therefore
      erred in holding that the lack of service invalidated the notice.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      plaintiffs filed the notice of discontinuance without an affidavit of service.
      Although his reasons are not entirely clear, the motion judge seems to
      have held that the lack of an affidavit of service also invalidated the
      notice of discontinuance. This was an error for three reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
      no affidavit of service was needed to discontinue against Muskoka, since
      it did not have to be served with the notice.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
      even if an affidavit was required because other defendants were served
      with the notice, the lack of an affidavit was an irregularity that did
      not invalidate the notice. This is evident from rule 2.01, which addresses
      the effect of non-compliance with the rules:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>A failure to comply with these rules
      is an irregularity and does not render a proceeding or a step, document
      or order in a proceeding a nullity …<b>.</b></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third,
      I do not think that the plaintiffs can rely on their own default to invalidate
      their notice. A notice of discontinuance was served on all necessary parties,
      and was filed with the court. It was therefore a valid notice. The plaintiffs
      discontinued their action against Muskoka on November 5, 2002.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Second Issue: Did the motion
      judge err in applying the discoverability principle to postpone the running
      of the limitation period? </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge said that if he was wrong in holding that the notice of discontinuance
    was invalid, he would apply the discoverability principle and grant the plaintiffs
    leave to add Muskoka as a defendant. Although he did not specify the date
    Muskoka was to be added, I take the date to be September 16, 2005, the date
    of his order. This date is well outside the three-month limitation period,
    and the motion judge gave Muskoka the right to plead a limitation period
    defence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    dealing with Muskoka’s submission on the issue itself, I will deal briefly
    with two subsidiary questions that arose during oral argument - the effect
    of this alternative relief, and whether the motion judge’s order was final
    or interlocutory for the purpose of appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Muskoka
    contended that the alternative relief granted by the motion judge – permitting
    the plaintiffs to add Muskoka as a defendant – was an
    “advisory opinion” and not an operative part of his order. In her able argument
    for Muskoka, Ms. Spafford pointed out that invalidating the notice of discontinuance
    and adding Muskoka as a defendant were inconsistent forms of relief and could
    not stand together. Therefore, she argued that the only operative part of
    the motion judge’s order was his declaration that the notice of discontinuance
    was invalid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept this argument. The motion judge granted the plaintiffs alternative
    relief in case an appellate court found that he was wrong about the notice
    of discontinuance. His decision that the plaintiffs could add Muskoka as
    a defendant is a formal part of his order (paragraph 3), and I think we should
    deal with it on that basis. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    oral argument, the court raised with counsel whether the order adding Muskoka
    as a defendant, subject to its right to plead the limitation period, was
    final or interlocutory. Standing on its own, it seems to me that the order
    is interlocutory and therefore appealable, only with leave, and not as of
    right. This case is distinguishable from <i>Ball v. Donais</i> (1993), 13
    O.R. (3d) 322 (C.A.) because it does not finally dispose of Muskoka’s substantive
    right to rely on a limitation period defence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Spafford, however, has persuaded me that in the context of the motion judge’s
    order as a whole, she was entitled as of right to appeal the part of the
    motion judge’s order adding Muskoka as a defendant. The part of his order
    declaring the notice of discontinuance invalid was unquestionably a final
    order, appealable to this court as of right. It would make no practical sense
    to require Muskoka, at the same time as it was appealing to this court, to
    seek leave to appeal to the Divisional Court from the alternative relief
    granted by the motion judge. Thus, I would treat his entire order as final
    for the purpose of this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    now turn to the question whether the motion judge committed a reviewable
    error in applying the discoverability principle to postpone the running of
    the limitation period. The rationale underlying the discoverability principle
    is that it would be unjust to permit a statutory limitation period to run
    before the plaintiffs knew, or by reasonable diligence could have known,
    they could bring an action. The principle applies to the limitation period
    at issue in this lawsuit, former s. 284(2) of the <i>Municipal Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. M. 45, which provided that, “No action shall be brought against
    a corporation for the recovery of damages occasioned by such default [lack
    of repair] … after the expiration of three months from the time the damages
    were sustained.”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a> See <i>Zapfe v. Barnes</i> (2003),
    66 O.R. (3d) 397 at para. 22 (C.A.); and <i>Bourne v. Saunby</i> (1998),
    38 O.R. (3d) 555 at 562 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge’s order applying the discoverability principle to permit the
    plaintiffs to add Muskoka as a defendant is a discretionary order. The well-established
    standard of review of discretionary orders applies. An appellate court should
    defer to the motion judge’s order unless he exercised his discretion unreasonably
    or acted on a wrong principle. See for example, <i>Kostopoulos v. Jesshope</i> (1985),
    50 O.R. (2d) 54 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Muskoka
    submits that the motion judge exercised his discretion unreasonably for two
    reasons: first, he ought not to have applied the discoverability principle
    because the plaintiffs had sued Muskoka within the limitation period; and
    second, he erred in leaving the question of the plaintiffs’ reasonable diligence
    to trial because there was no evidence before him that the plaintiffs had
    acted diligently. I do not agree with either submission.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is an unusual case in which to apply the discoverability principle because
    the plaintiffs initially named Muskoka in their notice of action. However,
    the affidavit of one of their lawyers said that they did so
    “out of an abundance of caution”, and not because they had any facts to support
    a claim against Muskoka. Discoverability means more than just knowing the
    identity of a potential tortfeasor. It also means knowledge of facts – acts
    or omissions – that may give rise to a cause of action against the tortfeasor.
    See <i>Zapfe, supra</i> at para. 32.  Thus, the plaintiffs’ suing Muskoka
    did not preclude the motion judge from applying the discoverability principle,
    nor did it make the exercise of his discretion unreasonable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    take advantage of the discoverability principle, the plaintiffs had to show
    that before they sought to add Muskoka as a defendant, they neither knew,
    nor by reasonable diligence could have known, that they had a claim against
    Muskoka. Here, Muskoka does not suggest that the plaintiffs knew they had
    a claim against it before the fall of 2004. Its focus is on the reasonable
    diligence requirement. It submits that on this record there was no evidence
    the plaintiffs acted diligently. Thus, they should not be entitled to add
    Muskoka as a defendant at this late stage. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge took a contrary view. He held at paras. 20-21 that the question
    whether the plaintiffs exercised reasonable diligence should be left to the
    trial judge:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>When there is a dispute concerning the exercise
    of due diligence on the part of the plaintiff it is necessary to give appropriate
    consideration to all the facts and the credibility of witnesses with relation
    to that issue. That is something that can be determined at trial. See <i>Wong
    v. Adler</i>, [2004] O.J. No. 1575 (S.C.J.). </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The issue with respect to due diligence in the
    prosecution of the claim can be raised by the defendant at trial. The defendant
    would have the right to assert its rights under the limitation period if
    it is shown at trial that the plaintiffs have failed to exercise due diligence
    in the prosecution of the claim. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge’s order is appropriate if the plaintiffs put forward some evidence
    of their diligence, and the question whether they exercised reasonable diligence
    cannot be decided at the pleading stage. See <i>Zapfe, supra </i>at para.
    37.  It seems to me that the plaintiffs put forward enough evidence to support
    the motion judge’s disposition.</p>

    driver of the other car died as a result of the accident, so that the only
    account of what had occurred was that of the plaintiffs. However, the plaintiffs’ lawyers
    did take steps to investigate the cause of the accident. In 2003, they made
    a freedom of information request to obtain the Ontario Provincial Police
    reports of the accident. But it was not until two events occurred in 2004
    that the plaintiffs became aware of a potential claim against Muskoka. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    July 2004, the plaintiffs received a police officer’s collision reconstructionist
    report, which showed that the highway shoulder drop-off may have caused the
    defendant driver to lose control of his car. Then, in September 2004, an
    articling student from the plaintiffs’ lawyer’s law firm went to the discovery
    of a representative of Muskoka in the third party action. The student learned
    that Muskoka may have allowed the shoulder drop-off to develop and then failed
    to repair it. Armed with the collision report, and the information from the
    discovery, the plaintiffs brought their motion. Whether they exercised reasonable
    diligence, or could have discovered their claim against Muskoka much earlier
    needs to be canvassed on a full evidentiary record. That was how the motion
    judge saw it. I cannot say that his view was unreasonable.</p>

      against Muskoka. For clarity, I would amend paragraph 3 of the motion judge’s
      order to provide:</span></p>
