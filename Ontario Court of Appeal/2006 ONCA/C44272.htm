    sentence imposed in respect of them in relation to a home invasion that
    occurred on January 16, 2003.  He was a
    young person at the time the offences occurred.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>J.S. was convicted of robbery and of using an imitation
    firearm in the commission of an indictable offence.  He contests his convictions on the basis that the trial judge
    misapprehended the evidence – particularly, the fingerprint evidence placing
    him at the scene of the crime – and submits, consequently, that the verdicts
    were unreasonable.  With respect to
    sentence, he contends that the trial judge erred in imposing a custodial
    sentence and in failing to consider alternatives to closed custody, and that
    the sentence is harsh and excessive.  The trial judge imposed a sentence of two years closed custody (plus
    forty-four days of pre-trial custody).</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the conviction
    appeal but grant leave to appeal sentence and vary the sentence imposed to one
    of fifteen months custody and community service.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>Facts</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the evening in question three males forced their way into a
    townhouse in the presence of its inhabitants.  The inhabitants were Joseph Iles; his mother, Debbie Iles; and his
    girlfriend, seventeen-year old Pearl Abbott, and their one-year old child,
    Almyna Abbott. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of the men carried a shotgun and another (the appellant) a
    machete; the third man was unarmed.  They asked Joseph Iles where the money or valuables were.  Two of them went upstairs, while the one
    with the shotgun stayed in the living room with Joseph.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The man with the shotgun first made Joseph sit on the couch
    and then, by pushing him with the barrel of the shotgun, took him into the
    basement, where the intruder looked around briefly before returning to the
    living room with his hostage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Still bearing his machete and wearing a hood, the appellant
    went to the upper level of the home.  There he first encountered Debbie Iles, and told her to go to the living
    room.  She obeyed.  Next, the appellant entered a bedroom where
    he encountered Pearl Abbot putting her infant to bed.  He was not verbally or physically abusive, but asked her where he
    could find some money.  When Ms. Abbott
    did not answer satisfactorily, he began searching the room, rummaging in the
    closet and the drawers, still in the presence of the young mother and her
    baby.  Eventually, the appellant
    instructed Ms. Abbott to take Almyna and go to the living room with the others,
    which she did.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly thereafter, the appellant and the unarmed man
    descended from the upstairs level carrying two pillowcases containing items
    taken from the house.  The three
    invaders left through the back door.  Joseph Iles went out the front door to follow them.  The male with the shotgun turned to face
    Joseph, aimed and pulled the trigger on the shotgun, but the weapon did not
    discharge.  The same male pointed
    another gun at Joseph, but again no bullet discharged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The items stolen included a Play Station videogame system,
    CD’s, a Discman, and cash in the amount of $30 - $40.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='
text-align:left;page-break-after:avoid'>The Conviction
    Appeal</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We did not call on the Crown with respect to the conviction
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The primary issue at trial was identification.  Joseph and Debbie Iles were not able to
    identify anyone from a photo-line up.  Pearl Abbott did pick out the appellant from a photo-line up several
    months later.  Pearl Abbot also
    testified that she had been in the bedroom with the male carrying the machete
    for several minutes and that she recognized him from around the
    neighbourhood.  In addition – and
    significantly – however, the police lifted the appellant’s fingerprint from a
    CD cover found in the bedroom where he had accosted Pearl Abbot and her baby. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Needless to say, the fingerprint evidence provided compelling
    corroboration for the identification evidence of the witnesses.  The only issue on the conviction appeal
    related to the validity of the fingerprint comparison and whether or not the
    trial judge had misapprehended the evidence in that regard.  We are satisfied he did not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A careful reading of the transcript demonstrates that the
    police officer compared the “found” print from the CD cover to the prints
    attributed to the appellant through the police computer search, and received on
    January 29, 2004, <u>and</u> to the prints that were taken from the appellant
    following his arrest in March 2004.  Although the officer who actually took the latter prints was not called
    as a witness, defence counsel admitted that those fingerprints were those of
    the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only other issue raised by the appellant in this regard
    was that there was a possible innocent explanation for how his fingerprints
    were found on the CD case.  There was no
    basis in the evidence for any other explanation, however.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regardless of whether the trial judge misapprehended whether
    the owner of the CD cover was Joseph Iles or his younger brother, Randy, the
    fact remains that the appellant’s fingerprints were found on that CD cover in
    the bedroom where Pearl Abbott placed him as the man with the machete.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The verdicts were not unreasonable.  The Crown’s case was uncontradicted and it pointed to the
    appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the conviction appeal must be dismissed.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>The Sentence Appeal</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge imposed a global sentence of two years
    (sixteen months in secure custody to be followed by eight months community
    supervision) in addition to crediting the appellant with forty-four days of
    pre-trial custody on a two-for-one basis, for an effective sentence of
    approximately two years and three months.  I would grant leave to appeal and, taking into account the pre-trial
    custody, vary the sentence to one of fifteen months custody and community
    service plus pre-trial custody, for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While it was open to the youth court justice to consider, and
    if appropriate to impose, a custodial sentence on the appellant in the
    circumstances of this case, he nonetheless erred in principle in his approach
    to sentencing the appellant.  He ignored
    the <i>Youth Criminal Justice Act</i>, S.C. 2002, c.1 (the “<i>YCJA</i>”) and
    focussed almost entirely on the gravity of the crime and the need to protect
    the public.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The youth court justice relied upon the decision of this court
    in <i>R. v. Wilmott</i>, [1967] 1 C.C.C. 171 (Ont. C.A.) for the proposition
    that the primary purpose of sentencing is the protection of society.  <i>Wilmott,</i> however, involved an adult
    offender, not a young person.  Moreover,
    it predates both the statement of the purposes and principles of sentencing for
    adults now found in s. 718 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and the new regime for
    dealing with the sentencing of young persons introduced through the <i>YCJA</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under the <i>YCJA</i>, alternatives to custody are to be given
    first consideration.  A youth court
    justice is not permitted to sentence a young person to custody unless the
    circumstances fall within one of the four exceptions set out in s. 39.  In this case, the exception for
    consideration is found in s. 39(1)(a): where “the young person has committed a
    violent offence”.  Before a custodial
    sentence could be imposed on the appellant, then, the question whether a home
    invasion is a violent offence for purposes of the <i>YCJA</i> had to be
    considered and thereafter, if so, whether a custodial sentence was appropriate
    in the circumstances.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'><u><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There has been some debate in the authorities on the meaning
    of the term “violent offence” as used in s. 39(1)(a) of the <i>YCJA</i>.  However, that debate has recently been
    resolved by the Supreme Court of Canada: see <i>R. v. C.D.; R. v. C.D.K.</i> [2005] 3 S.C.R. 668.  A violent offence
    is “an offence in the commission of which a young person causes, attempts to
    cause or threatens to cause bodily harm”: paras. 17, 53 and 87.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a>  “Bodily harm” incorporates the definition of
    bodily harm in s. 2 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, namely “any hurt or injury to
    a person that interferes with the health or comfort of the person and that is
    more than merely transient or trifling in nature.”  That hurt or injury may be physical or psychological.  See <i>R. v. C.D.; R. v. C.D.K.</i>, para.
    20.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short, a violent offence is an offence in the commission of
    which a young person causes, attempts to cause or threatens to cause physical
    or psychological harm or injury to a person that is more than transient or
    trifling in nature.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts of this case fall within the <i>YCJA</i> meaning of
    violent offence, in my opinion.  Counsel
    did not seriously contend to the contrary.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant and his companion intruders aggressively broke
    into the victims’ home, brandishing a machete and a shotgun.  They forced its occupants, who where
    dispersed around the house, to gather in the living room.  There the occupants were confined by one
    intruder bearing a shotgun, which he pointed at, at least one of them, while
    the other two – including the appellant, who was openly carrying the machete –
    ransacked the rest of the house for goods to be stolen.  Pearl Abbot was accosted by the appellant in
    the bedroom where she was putting her infant to sleep.  The ransacking of that room took place in
    their presence before she was required to go downstairs to the living
    room.  She said she was thinking of many
    things while this was happening.  “I
    didn’t know if they were going to hurt us.  I just wanted it to be over”, she testified.  As noted above, when the invaders left, one of them pointed the
    shotgun at the elder son and pulled the trigger.  Fortunately, the weapon did not discharge.  Defence counsel at trial acknowledged that
    the situation “would have been terror for the family”.  The record indicates the victims were
    sufficiently traumatized by the event that they have moved from the
    jurisdiction and are unwilling even to talk to police for the purpose of
    providing impact statements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    note as well, of course, that one of the offences of which the appellant
    was convicted was robbery, a crime that will almost always encompass violence
    as one of its constituent elements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Because what happened constituted a violent offence,
    therefore, the youth court justice was entitled to consider a custodial
    offence.  Before turning to the
    sentencing itself, however, I would like to comment briefly on the concept of
    “home invasion”, because it is in that context that the sentencing of the
    appellant occurred.</p>

    the <i>Criminal Code</i> or any other statute.  However, as the trial judge observed, a phenomenon that society has come
    to label “home invasion” is becoming more and more prevalent.  The label evokes considerable emotion on the
    part of those reacting to it.  Generally, it refers to an offence relating to a home, or – in the
    jargon of the law – a dwelling-place.  But what is it about the offence that characterizes it as a “home invasion”?  </p>

    instructive reference point.  Under the
    heading “Aggravating circumstances – home invasion”, s. 348.1 directs a court
    sentencing an adult person convicted of unlawful confinement, robbery,
    extortion, or break and enter in relation to a dwelling house to consider as an

    the <i>YCJA</i>, of course.  However,
    the factors it lists – the types of offences mentioned, committed in the
    context of an occupied home and accompanied by the use or threat of violence –
    are common to the notion of home invasion articulated in a number of
    authorities that have considered the issue, and to which I will refer in a
    moment.  In my view, it is the presence
    of the occupants of the home, with the violation of their sense of sanctity and
    security in that place and the attendant exposure to the threat (express or
    implied) of physical or psychological harm, that sets the home invasion apart
    from break and enter, robbery, and other offences committed in relation to a
    home.  Such a crime is a “violent
    offence” within the meaning of s. 39(1)(a) of the <i>YCJA</i> because it is an
    offence in which the young person “causes, attempts to cause or threatens to cause
    bodily harm” – physical or psychological.</p>

    with the theme outlined in para. 30 above, there appears to be general

    breaking and entering a dwelling place for purposes of committing a theft or
    robbery, knowing that (or being reckless as to whether) the home is being

    sentencing disposition.  In my opinion,
    however, it does open the gateway to consideration of a custodial sentence

    embedded in it a “violent offence” within the meaning of s. 39(1)(a) of that

    invasion, committed in the presence of the home’s inhabitants, by intruders
    (whether adults or young persons) brandishing weapons (whether real or

    visible use of weapons carries with it at least implicit intimidation and an
    implicit threat to cause bodily harm and, by itself, commands the compliance
    and non-resistance of victims.  The
    youth court justice was completely justified in characterizing the home
    invasion here as “an horrendous crime” and in underscoring its gravity.  As mentioned above, however, he erred in

    it repealed it.  The <i>YCJA</i> is a
    complex piece of legislation that has substantially changed the Canadian youth
    justice system at various stages of the process including: at the front end, by
    encouraging greater use of the diversionary programs; at bail hearings, by
    substantially limiting pre-trial detention; and in the adult sentencing
    process, by the presumptive application of adult sentences for some of the most
    serious offences.  Most of all, the <i>YCJA</i> brought about substantial changes in the general youth sentencing process.  The statute provides more specific guidance
    to judges.  Detailed sentencing
    principles are expressly set out.  Sentencing options are more regulated.  Factors to be taken into account are spelled out.  Mandatory restrictions are placed on the use
    of custodial sentences.  The new

    in Canadian history to structure judicial discretion regarding the sentencing
    of juveniles”: J.V. Roberts and N. Bala, “Understanding Sentencing Under the <i>Youth

    last resort.  As noted above,
    s.&nbsp;38(2)(d) specifically provides that “all available sanctions other than
    custody that are reasonable in the circumstances” are to be considered.  Section 39 reinforces this concept by
    prohibiting a youth court justice from committing a young person to custody
    under the youth sentences provisions of s. 42 unless one of the four gateway

    to conditions, the total of the periods not to exceed two years from the date

    three years custody and supervision, since he was convicted of robbery, an
    offence punishable by up to life imprisonment.  However, the fact that the offence committed by a young person is a
    “violent offence” does not mean that the young person must necessarily be given
    a custodial sentence.  Such a sentence
    is open for the youth court justice to consider in those circumstances.  But subsections 39(2) and (3) stipulate that
    the youth justice court must first consider all other alternatives to custody

    are reasonable in the circumstances, and determined that there is not a
    reasonable alternative, or combination of alternatives, that is in accordance
    with the purpose and principles set out in section 38.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N.</i>, <i>supra</i>, per Charron J. at para. 4.  As Charron J. also noted, however, at para.
    38:<u></u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Of
    course, this does [<i>sic</i> – does not?] mean that sentencing under the <i>YCJA</i> cannot have a deterrent effect.  The
    detection, arrest, conviction and consequences to the young person may well
    have a deterrent effect on others inclined to commit crime.  It also does not mean that the court must
    ignore the impact that the crime may have had on the community, as was
    suggested in argument.  A consideration
    of all relevant factors about the offence and the offender forms part of the
    sentencing process.  What the <i>YCJA</i> does not permit, however, is the use of general deterrence to justify a harsher
    sanction than that necessary to rehabilitate, reintegrate and hold accountable
    the <i>specific young person before the court</i>. [emphasis in original]</p>

    appellant’s rehabilitation and reintegration into society and be less
    restrictive of the appellant’s liberty, and it is with those considerations in
    mind that I have decided that a shorter period of custody than that imposed by
    the youth court justice is appropriate.  However, accountability and meaningful consequences for the appellant,
    as well as his rehabilitation and reintegration, inform the principles and the
    crafting of a disposition that will contribute to the long-term protection of
    society.  Moreover, the sentencing
    principles articulated in subsection 38(2) direct that the sentence must be
    proportionate to the seriousness of the crime and the degree and responsibility
    of the offender (38(2)(c)) –important considerations in this case – and that
    the youth justice court is to take into account, amongst other things, (a) the
    degree of participation by the young person in the commission of the offence,
    (b) the harm done to the victims, and (c) any other aggravating and mitigating
    circumstances related to the young person or the offence that are relevant to
    the purpose and principles set out in the section (38(3)).</p>

    offence – including the fact that the appellant was armed with a machete and
    must have known that his co-perpetrator was armed at least with one real or
    imitation shotgun – to be a significant aggravating factor that is relevant for
    the purposes and principles of s. 38.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the same time, there are a number of positive mitigating
    factors in the appellant’s favour.  He
    was only sixteen at the time of the offences.  His family was under unusual financial pressures and living in the
    shelter system.  In an attempt to avoid
    a negative impact on the appellant they had sent him to live at friends’
    homes.  Unfortunately this left him
    unsupervised, and he committed this offence.</p>

line-height:normal'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant has no criminal or youth record.  His family is supportive, and he has
    apparently taken some encouraging steps in turning himself around.  He has had no problems while on release,
    both prior to trial and pending his appeal.  He has been consistently employed and his employer speaks highly of
    him.  And he has completed all credits
    required for graduation from high school while in custody at Brookside Youth
    Facility.  I commend the appellant for
    his progress, which demonstrates his potential for rehabilitation and
    reintegration into society.  I have
    taken all of these factors into account in deciding to impose a shorter
    sentence than that ordered by the trial judge.</p>

    where young persons have received custodial sentences, for what counsel submits
    are comparable crimes, ranging from three or four months open or closed custody
    plus community supervision to sixteen months open custody plus community
    supervision: see <i>R. v. M.A.J.</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 829 (C.J.) (sixteen
    months open custody and eight months community service for robbery (x2) and
    disguise with intent); <i>R. v. C. (E.)</i>, [2004] O.J. No. 5526 (C.J.) (sixty
    days secure custody plus thirty days community supervision on a plea of guilty
    for robbery (x2) and use of a firearm in commission of an offence); <i>R. v.
    B.S.</i>, [2003] O.J. No. 2515 (C.J.) (twelve months probation, sixty hours
    community service, and an $80 restitution order); <i>R. v. J.W.E.</i>, [2003]
    O.J. No. 5998 (C.J.) (four months closed custody followed by four months open
    custody and six months probation); <i>R. v. B.C.D.</i>, [2004] A.J. No. 1094
    (C.A.) (sentence for a residential break and enter, theft and mischief reduced
    on appeal from twelve months custody and six months supervision to six months
    closed custody and three months supervision); <i>R. v. E.B.C.</i>, [2005] A.J.
    No. 120 (C.A.) (sentence of eight months in custody followed by four months
    supervision and restitution after guilty plea for residential break and enter
    and assault, upheld on appeal).  These
    cases involved crimes of violence, including robbery, but none was in the home
    invasion context.  </p>

    thirty months imprisonment plus six months of pre-trial custody for the robbery

    sentence of fifteen months custody and community supervision is appropriate in
    the circumstances of this case.  This is
    in addition to three months credit for time served in pre-trial custody, for a
    total sentence of eighteen months.  The
    fifteen months sentence is to consist of ten months custody (six months secure

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is some debate about whether a youth justice court has
    the authority, when imposing a custodial sentence, to make an order that the
    sentence be served partly in secure custody and partly in open custody.  In <i>R. v. W. (F.L.)</i> (1986), 78 N.S.R.
    (2d) 225, the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Appeal Division, held that a trial
    judge was in error in combining secure and open custody under the <i>Young
    Offenders Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. Y-1.  See Priscilla Platt, <i>Young Offenders Law in Canada</i>, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed. (Markham and Vancouver: Butterworths, 1995) at 460 for a similar view.  This court has imposed or upheld such
    combination custodial sentences in the past without comment on their propriety,
    however:  see <i>R. v. P.R.</i>, [1995]
    O.J. No. 768; <i>R. v. S.K.</i>, [2003] O.J. No. 2690; <i>R. v. B.M</i>, [2003]
    O.J. No. 22<i>.</i>  On the other hand,
    in <i>R. v. B.G.</i>, [1990] O.J. No. 1278 (C.A.), the argument was raised that
    the combination of both open and secure custody was not authorized, but the
    court did not find it necessary to address the issue.  Similarly, the argument was made before the British Columbia
    Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. A. (B.A.)</i>, [1991] B.C.J. No. 753, but the court
    decided the appeal on other ground and thus declined to discuss the issue.</p>

line-height:normal'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The problem arises from the language of s. 24.1 of the <i>Young
    Offenders Act</i>,<i> </i>now repealed, but which remains relevant for purposes
    of determining the level of custody for young persons in Ontario.  The <i>YCJA</i> does not distinguish between
    “secure custody” and “open custody” facilities.  Those designations were used under the <i>Young Offenders Act</i>.  However, any place formerly designated as a
    place of “open custody” or “secure custody” under the former Act is deemed to
    have been designated a “youth court facility” for purposes of the <i>YCJA</i> (<i>YCJA</i>,
    s. 165(6)).  Ontario has elected by
    Order-in-Council<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[6]</span></a>, pursuant to
    s. 88 of the <i>YCJA, </i>to have the power to make determinations of the level
    of custody for young persons exercised by youth court justices in accordance
    with s. 24.1 to s. 24.3 of the <i>Young Offenders Act</i>.  Hence the relevance of s. 24.1(2) of that
    Act, which states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Subject
    to subsection (3), where the youth court commits a young person to custody  . . .  it shall specify in the order <i>whether the custody is to be open
    custody or secure custody</i> [emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The argument that it is not permissible for a youth court
    justice, when determining the level of custody of a young person, to order a
    set portion to be served in secure custody and a set portion to be served in
    open custody, is founded on the view that the word “or” in s. 24.1(2) must be
    interpreted as strictly disjunctive.  I
    do not agree.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel did not address this problem either in their facta or
    in their oral arguments.  After
    reserving our decision, however, the court requested written submissions on the
    issue.  Mr. Giourgas and Mr. Perfetto
    have filed a joint submission in which they agree that the court has the
    jurisdiction to direct that one portion of the sentence is to be served in
    secure custody while another portion is to be served in open custody.  Their joint submission seems to be confined
    to circumstances where a young person has been found guilty of two separate
    offences – in this case, for example, robbery and use of an imitation firearm –
    in which case the court may sentence the youth to secure custody on one offence
    and open custody on the other.  In
    support of this position, counsel refer to s. 24.3 of the <i>Young Offenders
    Act</i>, which states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>24.3(1)
    Where a young person is committed to open custody and secure custody pursuant
    to subsection 24.1(2), any portions of which dispositions are to be served
    consecutively, the disposition of secure custody shall be served first without
    regard to the order in which the dispositions were imposed.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>       (2) Where a young person is committed
    to open custody and secure custody pursuant to subsection 24.1(2), any portions
    of which dispositions are to be served concurrently, the concurrent portions of
    the dispositions shall be served in secure custody.</p>

line-height:normal'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although this is sufficient to dispose of this appeal, I would
    not interpret the ability to order open or secure custody so narrowly.  The provisions of s. 24.3 are necessary to
    deal with situations where a young person is sentenced on more than one offence
    and to clarify that custodial sentences are to be kept to a minimum in such
    circumstances.  It does not follow that
    open and secure custody may not be divided in relation to a single offence.  In my opinion, the power to order whether
    custody is to be open or secure implies the power to order, where appropriate,
    that the custodial sentence be served in some form of combination of the
    two.  The operative language of the
    statute must now be interpreted in the context of the <i>YCJA</i>, its purpose,
    and the principles of sentencing that underlie its new sentencing regime – all
    as alluded to above.  This
    interpretation is consistent with those considerations.</p>

    sentence is varied to provide for a sentence of fifteen months custody and
    community service.  The sentence is to
    be served in the form of ten months custody (six months secure and four months
    open) plus five months of community supervision.  I note that the appellant has already served four months of the
    custodial sentence.  I would not vary
