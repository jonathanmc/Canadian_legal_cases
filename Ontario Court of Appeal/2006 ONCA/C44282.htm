style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    September 17, 2004, Flynn J. of the Superior Court of Justice made an order
    in the matrimonial proceeding between the respondent, Catherine Mary Stevens,
    and her then husband, Peter Henry Nagtzaam, vesting title to the parties’ former
    matrimonial home in Ms. Stevens, retroactive to July 31, 1998 - the date
    of the parties’ separation (the “Vesting Order”).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    on November 30, 2000, the appellant, Royal Bank of Canada (the “Bank”), had
    filed writs of seizure and sale against Mr. Nagtzaam concerning an unsatisfied
    judgment arising from Mr. Nagtzaam’s default under a loan advanced to him
    by the Bank in 1999.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the Vesting Order, when the Bank declined to lift its writs of seizure and
    sale in respect of the parties’ former matrimonial home, Ms. Stevens applied
    for a declaration that the writs were not applicable to the matrimonial home,
    among other relief.  In response, the Bank cross-applied for an order amending
    or varying the effective date of the Vesting Order to September 17, 2004
    (the date of Flynn J.’s order) or, in the alternative, granting the Bank
    standing to appeal the Vesting Order.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    applications were heard by Reilly J. of the Superior Court of Justice on
    August 22, 2005.  By judgment dated September 12, 2005, the application judge
    granted the declaratory relief sought by Ms. Stevens and dismissed the Bank’s
    cross-application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge held that only a party to an original proceeding is entitled
    to appeal or to apply for an order under the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>,
    R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194 to amend or vary a final judgment.  Accordingly, he
    concluded that he had no jurisdiction to alter or vary the Vesting Order
    or to grant the Bank standing to appeal from it.  He, therefore, declined
    to interfere with the Vesting Order in any respect.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge further held that Flynn J. had granted the Vesting Order
    based on his conclusion that a constructive trust existed in favour of Ms.
    Stevens, with the result that Mr. Nagtzaam’s interest in the matrimonial
    home vested in Ms. Stevens as of the date of separation.  It followed that,
    as of July 31, 1998, Mr. Nagtzaam had no further proprietary or other interest
    in the matrimonial home, and no writ of seizure and sale thereafter obtained
    by a creditor of Mr. Nagtzaam could attach to that property.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      Bank appeals from the application judge’s judgment on several grounds.  In
      my view, the grounds of appeal advanced by the Bank are subsumed in the
      following two broad issues:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1) Whether the application judge erred in his
    inter-pretation of Flynn J.’s decision regarding the basis for the retroactive
    Vesting Order; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) Whether, in the circumstances, the retroactive
    aspect of the Vesting Order is effective as against the Bank.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>III.            Discussion</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(1)            Decision of
      Flynn J.</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Bank argues that the Vesting Order was made under the authority of s.&nbsp;10
      of </span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>the <i>Family Law
        Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3, rather than in reliance on principles of
        constructive trust and that Flynn J. neither ordered nor intended that
        the Vesting Order have retroactive effect.  I disagree.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although
      it is true that Flynn J. did not mention retroactivity in his reasons and
      that the words “in trust” or “constructive trust” similarly do not appear
      in his reasons, Flynn J. signed the formal Vesting Order.  Therefore, in
      the absence of evidence to the contrary, which does not exist in this case,
      it must be presumed that Flynn J. was aware of the terms of the Vesting
      Order, including its provision for retroactivity, and that he was satisfied
      that the Vesting Order reflected his disposition concerning the matrimonial
      home.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      any event, as I elaborate later in these reasons, I am satisfied that Flynn
      J.’s findings concerning the understanding between Mr. Nagtzaam and Ms.
      Stevens at the time of their separation included the implicit finding that,
      from shortly after the date of their separation in July 1998, Mr. Nagtzaam’s
      interest in the matrimonial home was impressed with a trust in </span>favour<span lang=EN-US> of
      Ms. Stevens.  The retroactive nature of the Vesting Order accords with
      this key finding.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although
      Flynn J. did not refer explicitly in his reasons to the doctrine of constructive
      trust, he did hold that an understanding had been reached between Mr. Nagtzaam
      and Ms. Stevens concerning the matrimonial home, which was enforceable “in
      equity”.  He further held that Ms. Stevens acted in reliance on the understanding
      that Mr. Nagtzaam’s interest in the matrimonial home would be transferred
      to her in consideration for her payment of his debts and the spouses’ joint
      debts at the time of separation.  Ms. Stevens fulfilled her part of this
      bargain.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In
      these circumstances, I agree with the application judge that Flynn J.’s
      reasons compel the conclusion that he based the Vesting Order on the equitable
      principles inherent in the constructive trust remedy.  The Bank, quite
      properly in my view, does not suggest that the remedy of constructive trust
      cannot have retroactive effect in a proper case.  That Flynn J. also alluded
      to his authority under s.&nbsp;10 of the <i>Family Law Act</i> to declare
      the ownership or right to possession of particular property does not displace
      this interpretation.  As was noted by this court in <i>Martin v. Martin </i>(1992),
      8 O.R. (3d) 41 and <i>Miller v. Miller</i>, [1996] O.J. No. 863 at paras.
      11 and 12, s. 10 of the <i>Family Law Act </i>is procedural in nature.  It
      is a vehicle through which questions of ownership or possession may be
      determined and the declaratory relief authorized by s. 10(1)(a) must find
      a substantive basis elsewhere.  </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(2)            Effectiveness
      of the Vesting Order                                                                         As
      Against the Bank</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Bank contends that the doctrine of constructive trust was unavailable to
    ground a retroactive Vesting Order, because the imposition of such a trust
    in this case unjustly defeated the interests of intervening creditors (like
    the Bank) and because it also had the effect of “wiping out”
    the Bank’s writs.  The Bank further submits that the provisions of the <i>Family
    Law Act</i> do not permit the court to oust execution creditors by granting
    a retroactive vesting order regarding property.  It, therefore, argues that
    the retroactive aspect of the Vesting Order is ineffective as against the
    Bank.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the circumstances of this case, it is my view that the Bank’s argument cannot
    succeed.  I say this for several reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    many of the cases relied upon by the Bank in support of its position are
    concerned with the court’s jurisdiction to grant vesting orders as a remedy
    for implementing the substantive powers contained in family law legislation:
    see for example, <i>Maroukis v. Maroukis</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 137; and <i>Ferguson
    v. Ferguson</i> (1994), 7 R.F.L. (4th) 384 (Ont. Unified Fam. Ct.).  But
    that is not this case.  I have already concluded that the retroactive Vesting
    Order here was anchored in the equitable principles of constructive trust.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    several of the submissions advanced by the Bank constitute a collateral attack
    on the decision of Flynn J. rather than a challenge of the application judge’s
    decision.  Such an attack is not open to the Bank.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the Bank emphasizes that its interests were not contemplated or protected
    under the Vesting Order because Flynn J. did not have an opportunity to consider
    the effect of a retroactive vesting order on third party execution creditors.  The
    application judge found as a fact, however, that the Bank was put on notice
    in June 2002 by Ms. Stevens’ then counsel that the effect of a successful
    outcome for Ms. Stevens in the matrimonial proceeding would mean that Mr. <span
lang=EN-US>Nagtzaam</span> would have no interest in the matrimonial home.  The
    notice letter to the Bank from Ms. Stevens’ counsel was provided to the Bank
    at a time when it was an execution creditor of Mr. <span lang=EN-US>Nagtzaam</span> and
    prior to Flynn J.’s order.  Despite this advance notice that its interests
    could be adversely affected, the Bank took no steps to intervene in the matrimonial
    proceeding.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    and importantly, the warning contained in the notice letter provided to the
    Bank by Ms. Stevens’ counsel was expressed this way: “If Mrs. Stevens is
    successful in her claims, [Mr. <span lang=EN-US>Nagtzaam</span>] would have
    no interest in the matrimonial home <i>as he would hold his interest in trust
    for Mrs. Stevens</i>”
    [emphasis added].  In addition, the notice letter stated: “[Ms. Stevens]
    is claiming that Mr. Nagtzaam holds his one half interest in the matrimonial
    home in trust for her.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    language clearly put the Bank on notice of a trust claim by Ms. Stevens concerning
    the matrimonial home, at a time when it was open to the Bank to take action
    to protect its position.  It also confirms that the matter of a trust claim
    was a live issue before Flynn J.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    facts lead to the inescapable inference that the Bank’s failure to seek to
    intervene in the matrimonial proceeding resulted either from execution creditor
    tactics or because the Bank ‘dropped the ball’.  In these circumstances,
    the Bank could hardly be heard to complain before the application judge (more
    than three years after the Bank received the relevant warning from Ms. Stevens’ matrimonial
    counsel) that the retroactive Vesting Order was fatally flawed or fundamentally
    unjust.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifth,
    I do not agree with the Bank’s contention that the Vesting Order is ineffective
    as against it because the prerequisites for the imposition of a constructive
    trust were not met in this case.  I do agree, however, that the determination
    of this issue required an evaluation and weighing of the equities as between
    the Bank and Ms. Stevens by the application judge.  The application judge’s
    reasons do not permit me to conclude that this analysis was undertaken.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no issue between the parties that the leading authorities on the imposition
    of a constructive trust are the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada
    in <i>Soulos v. Korkontzilas</i>,<i> </i>[1997] 2 S.C.R. 217 and <i>Peter
    v. Beblow</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 980.  The relevant principles outlined in
    those cases need not be repeated here.  I am satisfied that the application
    of these principles to the facts of this case establishes that the Bank’s
    writs are ineffective as against the former matrimonial home.  My reasons
    for reaching this conclusion may be briefly stated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice
    Flynn determined that, at the time of the parties’
    separation, Mr. <span lang=EN-US>Nagtzaam</span> agreed to transfer all of
    his right, title and interest in the matrimonial home to his wife, provided
    that she paid his credit card and other accumulated debts.  As I have said,
    Ms. Stevens did so.  But Mr.<span lang=EN-US> Nagtzaam</span>, when presented
    with a transfer document regarding the matrimonial home, refused to sign
    it.  Against this factual backdrop, Flynn J. implicitly found that, from
    the time that Ms. Stevens paid the parties’ and Mr. Nagtzaam’s debts, Mr. <span lang=EN-US>Nagtzaam</span> held
    his interest in the former matrimonial home in trust for his wife. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties separated in July 1998.  Mr. <span lang=EN-US>Nagtzaam</span> did
    not apply for a loan with the Bank until October 1999, and the Bank did not
    obtain a judgment and its writs against him until November 2000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this record, I am satisfied that Ms. Stevens paid the agreed debts on behalf
    of Mr. <span lang=EN-US>Nagtzaam</span> prior to the date on which the Bank
    obtained and filed its writs of seizure and sale.  Thus, when the writs were
    obtained, Mr. <span lang=EN-US>Nagtzaam</span> had no interest in the matrimonial
    home to which the writs could attach.  His former interest in the matrimonial
    home was now the subject of a trust in favour of Ms. Stevens.  The Bank,
    as an execution creditor, could not enjoy any right to the matrimonial home
    different or greater than the right enjoyed by Mr.<span lang=EN-US> Nagtzaam</span>.  I
    note, in this regard, that when applying for a loan from the Bank in 1999,
    it appears that Mr. <span lang=EN-US>Nagtzaam</span> made no mention of the
    matrimonial home or any interest therein when disclosing his assets to the
    Bank.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice
    Flynn’s reasons make clear his finding that Ms. Stevens became entitled to
    Mr. <span lang=EN-US>Nagtzaam’s</span> interest in the matrimonial home prior
    to the date on which the Bank acquired any legal rights as an execution creditor
    of Mr.<span lang=EN-US> Nagtzaam</span>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    offer the following final observations.  It is of some significance that,
    prior to Mr. <span lang=EN-US>Nagtzaam</span> seeking a loan from the Bank,
    Ms. Stevens, who had continued to employ Mr. <span
lang=EN-US>Nagtzaam</span> following their separation, discovered that he was
    defrauding her company.  The police were notified, as were several financial
    institutions, <i>including the Bank</i>, of the allegations of fraud against
    Mr. <span lang=EN-US>Nagtzaam</span>.  Ultimately, Mr. <span lang=EN-US>Nagtzaam</span> was
    convicted of fraud.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Bank chose to ignore Ms. Stevens’ warning and, nonetheless, advanced to Mr. <span lang=EN-US>Nagtzaam</span> a
    loan upon which he subsequently defaulted.  As I have said, approximately
    three years later, the Bank again chose to ignore a warning from Ms. Stevens
    delivered through her counsel – this time regarding the implications for
    the Bank of an outcome in the matrimonial proceeding favourable to Ms. Stevens.</p>

    all the circumstances, I am of the opinion that the granting of the Vesting
    Order, retroactive to the date of the parties’ separation, was not inappropriate.  On
    the somewhat unusual facts of this case, I have no hesitation in concluding
    that the equities as between Ms. Stevens and the Bank compel the dismissal
    of this appeal.</p>

    I would dismiss the appeal.  Ms. Stevens is entitled to her costs of the
    appeal on a partial indemnity basis, fixed in the amount of $5,900, inclusive
    of disbursements and Goods and Services Tax.</p>
