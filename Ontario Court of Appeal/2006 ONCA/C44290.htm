      that there was no real and substantial connection with Ontario and on the

      Triton International Ltd. (“CTI”) was an Ontario corporation that contracted
      with NIOC to drill oil wells in Iran.  Vladamir Katic was the president
      and principal shareholder of CTI.  While the work was being carried out
      in Iran, CTI became bankrupt and PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PWC” or “PWL”)
      was appointed as its receiver.  </span></p>

      plaintiff, Crown Resources Corporation (“Crown Resources”), is a Liberian
      corporation with offices in the Isle of Man.  It was a creditor of CTI.  The
      plaintiff, Ata Olfati, is a former officer and creditor of CTI.  Both plaintiffs
      are assignees of the bankrupt estate of CTI pursuant to s. 38 of the <i>Bankruptcy
      Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3.  The plaintiff, Olfati, is a Canadian citizen
      of Iranian origin.  Katic emigrated to Canada from Saudi Arabia in 1966
      and now resides in the United States.</span></p>

      is an Iranian state owned corporation and NIDC is a wholly owned subsidiary
      of NIOC. The distinction between the two corporations is often blurred
      in the documentation.  For example, as will be seen later, a contract between
      PWC and NIDC required approval of the boards of directors of both NIDC
      and NIOC and it is the board of NIOC that purported to cancel the contract
      on the joint letterhead of NIOC/NIDC.  Moreover, in the statement of claim,
      in their factums and in argument, counsel often referred to both defendants
      although only one defendant was intended. </span></p>

      the the action against NIOC, the plaintiffs seek damages for the unpaid
      balance under the 1990 contract, the seizure of CTI’s oil rigs, NIOC’s
      wrongful refusal to process the exportation from Iran of CTI’s property,
      and breach of NIOC’s fiduciary duty to CTI.  The defendants submit that
      Ontario has no jurisdiction over the claims because the 1990 contract contains
      a forum selection clause in favour of Iran, because the claims have no
      real and substantial connection to Ontario, and because of sovereign immunity
      and the act of state doctrine.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      action against NIDC is based on a breach of the 1996 contract for the purchase
      of spare parts and materials for the oil drills located in Iran and on
      a breach of the 1998 contract for the purchase of drilling equipment located
      in Iran.  The position of the defendants is that the 1996 contract has
      no connection to Ontario and although the 1998 contract contains a forum
      selection clause in favour of Ontario, the NIOC board of directors never
      approved the contract, as specifically required under the contract. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
      the outset, it is important to point out that the motions judge correctly,
      in my view, noted that the positions of the parties are based on conflicting
      evidence as to how the parties see the operation of these contracts and
      that the issues can only be resolved at trial. She stated that it was not
      necessary for her to analyze the various documents filed on the motions
      in order to reach a decision.  She also stated that “the expert opinions
      provided by the parties are intriguing in their opposite views”.  However,
      having said that, she chose to comment on the reports of the experts on
      Iranian law, where the conflict in their evidence is particularly apparent.  In
      commenting on their reports, the motions judge stated: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>I prefer the Report of Mr. Katirai [for the plaintiffs]
      over that of Dr. Hossein-Abadi [for the defendants], in that the Katirai
      Report gives the realities of what takes place in the judicial system in
      Iran and in its approach to how it structures its legal system.  While
      the issues of human rights and freedom of speech are separate issues apart
      from strictly contract law, I do not think that the fears of Olfati and
      Katic are unfounded. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This
      finding of the motions judge is not supported by the contents of the reports
      and the distinction drawn between the reports does not support her conclusion.  Both
      reports deal with what takes place in the judicial system in Iran and its
      structure.  Both experts have impressive credentials and each one clearly
      seeks to advance the position of the parties who retained him.  In my view,
      at this stage of the proceeding, the conflict in the reports cannot be
      resolved any better than the conflicting evidence between the parties.</span></p>

      contract is in Farsi and English.  It is two hundred and thirty-three pages
      in length and has eleven schedules attached to it.  It was signed in Iran.  The
      contract provided for NIOC to import CTI’s equipment into Iran and for
      CTI to export the equipment out of Iran as “temporary imported goods”,
      as a way to avoid duties.  Also, at the end of the contract, NIOC had the
      option of purchasing six of the ten drilling rigs used by CTI, which it
      declined to do.</span></p>

      place in Ontario and the trustee is in Ontario.  In addition she noted
      that CTI is an Ontario corporation and “both NIOC and NIDC were aware that

      there is strong cause not to enforce the forum selection clause in the

      be no action.  The bankruptcy proceeding and the residence of the trustee,
      who is not a party to these proceedings, have nothing to do with the contract.  It
      would be more logical, in my view, to say that any dealings with respect
      to the contract should be viewed in light of Iranian laws since both defendants

      when the parties have a dispute over the payment under the contract.  This
      cannot be correct.  It is precisely when there is a dispute that the forum

      be argued that no other system is as independent as Ontario’s (or Canada’s).  Here,
      the plaintiffs agreed to the forum and an important question to be addressed
      is whether the Iranian legal system had deteriorated since the contract

      it is not determinative of the issue.  In this case there is much more.  CTI
      was an experienced international player on the world oil scene that did
      business where American companies would not.  Its president, Katic, and
      Olfati had extensive international business and extensive experience in
      Iran.  Both were instrumental in negotiating the contract.  CTI sought
      business in Iran.  It was represented by experienced Iranian advisers and
      knew the risks of doing business in Iran.  It was required to obtain insurance
      by its financiers for the very risks that are now being alleged. CTI knew
      or ought to have been aware of every issue they now allege makes Iran an
      unfair jurisdiction in which to litigate.  It was prepared to take the
      risk of the Iranian legal system in exchange for a $250 million U.S. contract,
      fully aware of the possible consequences.  And, there is no evidence to

      my view, those factors demonstrate that the claims founded on the seizure
      of the rigs and associated assets, and the refusal to permit the exportation
      of the remaining assets fit within the broad language in clause 52 of the
      contract, cited earlier, that if “any dispute or difference of any kind” arose
      between CTI and NIOC “in connection with or arising out of the Contract
      or the carrying out of the Works” it shall be resolved by referring it
      to the competent Court in Iran. The language used is extremely broad and
      was likely intended by the parties to encompass the disputes over the seizure
      of the oil rigs and the exportation of the assets.  I would adopt the reasoning
      of the British Columbia Court of Appeal, which held in two cases that similar
      language in a contractual forum selection clause applied to related tort
      claims: see <i>Sarabia v. Oceanic Mindore (The)</i> (1996), 26 B.C.L.R.
      (3d) 143 and <i>Scalas Fashions Ltd. v. Yorkton Securities Inc.</i> (2003),

      only two of the five claims against NIOC are for breach of the contract
      containing the selection clause, the three remaining claims arising from
      the seized rigs and the refusal to permit exportation of the assets are
      so intertwined with the contract so as to justify that they be heard together

      reasons of the Supreme Court in <i>Z.I. Pompey</i> indicate that where
      there is a forum selection clause in favour of a foreign jurisdiction and
      the court concludes that the plaintiff has not shown
    “strong cause”, the stay must be granted and it is not necessary to engage
    in an analysis of the real and substantial connection test.  Similarly, because
    the proceeding must be stayed on the basis of the forum selection clause,
    there is no need to address the issue of sovereign immunity or the act of
    state doctrine.  Therefore the above analysis of the forum selection clause
    is sufficient to dispose of the appeal of the action against NIOC.</span></p>

      I would add that if I had concluded that the tort claims did not fall within
      the scope of the forum selection clause, I would still have reached the
      same conclusion.   As confirmed by this court in <i>Muscutt v. Courcelles</i> (2002),
      60 O.R. (3d) 20 at para. 19, there are three ways in which jurisdiction
      may be asserted against an out-of-province defendant: (1) presence-based
      jurisdiction; (2) consent-based jurisdiction; and (3) assumed jurisdiction
      on a real and substantial connection.  </span></p>

      Ontario cannot exercise its jurisdiction to hear this action on the basis
      of either (1) or (2).  NIOC was not present in Ontario and was served outside
      the province pursuant to Rule 17.02 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> R.R.O.
      1990, Reg. 194<i>.</i>   Further, NIOC has not attorned to the jurisdiction
      and the forum selection clause in the contract in favour of Iran implies
      the very opposite of consent to Ontario’s jurisdiction.  Thus, the only
      basis upon which Ontario could exercise jurisdiction over the defendant
      is through assumed jurisdiction based on a real and substantial connection

      be determined in light of the relevant evidence at trial under the law

      As was argued by the defendants with respect to the 1990 contract, it is
      what the parties expressly agreed to in the 1998 contract. It is interesting

      the result, in the first action against NIOC and the part of the second
      action against NIDC based on the 1996 contract, the appeals are allowed
      and the actions are stayed.  The balance of the appeals are dismissed and
      the action against NIDC based on the 1998 contract is allowed to proceed.</span></p>

      on the appeal has been divided.  The first action, which has been stayed,
      was by far the more important one and one-half of the second has also been
      stayed.  I estimate that, in the circumstances, the ratio of success and
      loss should be 75% - 25% in favour of the defendants.     </span></p>

      would fix the costs payable to the defendants at 75% of the amount submitted,

      action on the 1998 contract proceeds in Ontario, payment of the costs cannot
      be enforced until judgment in the action is rendered or the expiration
      of twelve months from the date of this judgment, whichever happens first,
