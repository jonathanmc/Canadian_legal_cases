    on the ground of delay pursuant to rule&nbsp;24.01(1)(c) of the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i>.  Although the motion judge did not find the plaintiff’s
    delay in prosecuting the action intentional or contumelious, she concluded
    that “the plaintiff has failed to rebut the presumption that there is a substantial
    risk that the defendant physicians will not have a fair trial, given the
    length of the delay and the impact on witnesses’ memories”.  In addition,
    she found that the defendants had “given evidence” of actual prejudice emanating
    from the delay.  For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal.</p>

    is a medical malpractice action arising from the care and treatment the appellant
    received from the respondents, Dr.&nbsp;McCall and Dr.&nbsp;Whaley, after
    he fell from a ladder and injured his left foot on August&nbsp;20,&nbsp;1997.  On
    the same day, he was seen in the emergency room of the Centre Grey General
    Hospital by Dr.&nbsp;Whaley, who was his family doctor.  X&#8209;rays revealed
    a severe fracture to the appellant’s left heel.  As there was no orthopaedic
    surgeon on staff, Dr.&nbsp;Whaley transferred the appellant to Meaford General
    Hospital where Dr.&nbsp;McCall treated him for his fracture.  On August&nbsp;23,&nbsp;1997,
    he performed surgery to reconstruct the appellant’s heal.  The plaintiff
    contends that the surgery was unsuccessful.  Shortly thereafter the appellant
    contracted an infection and was returned to Centre Grey General Hospital
    on August&nbsp;28,&nbsp;1997.  On August&nbsp;31,&nbsp;1997 and September&nbsp;5,&nbsp;1997,
    it is alleged that Dr.&nbsp;McCall performed two procedures to treat the
    infection.  Thereafter, the appellant was transferred to the care of an orthopaedic
    surgeon at St.&nbsp;Michael’s Hospital in Toronto for further surgery to
    treat the fracture and the infection.</p>

  <h2 style='line-height:normal'>IV</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    Sachs&nbsp;J. and B.&nbsp;Wright&nbsp;J. found that the defendant physicians
    had not satisfied the test for dismissing the action for delay, the appellant
    argued before the motion judge that the proper starting point for assessing
    whether there had been delay in prosecuting the action that had resulted
    in irreparable prejudice to the defendants was the dates when these motions
    were decided.  Without stating why, the motion judge rejected the appellant’s
    position.  She held that it was appropriate to consider “the whole course
    of [the] action” in determining whether it should be dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
    then proceeded to  find that there had been “inordinate delay in this case” and
    that the appellant was primarily responsible for the delay in having “failed
    to diligently prosecute this action for years”.  In reaching this finding,
    she recognized that the defendant hospitals were responsible for part of
    the delay arising from their motion for leave to appeal from the order of
    B.&nbsp;Wright&nbsp;J. that was brought on September&nbsp;30,&nbsp;2003 and
    decided on February&nbsp;20,&nbsp;2004.  Focusing on what occurred subsequent
    to the order of O’Driscoll&nbsp;J., she also rejected the appellant’s position
    that the delay was excusable.  In this regard, at paragraph&nbsp;16 the motion
    judge reiterated her earlier position:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Moreover, it is not just the delay since the order
    of O’Driscoll J. that must be explained, <i>but the whole period of delay</i>,
    other than that attributable to the defendant hospitals.&nbsp; The plaintiff
    has failed to provide a reasonable explanation for <i>the overall delay</i> [emphasis
    added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    well, in paragraph 17, although the motion judge declined to characterize
    the appellant’s failure to comply with the order of O’Driscoll&nbsp;J. as “intentional
    or contumelious” based on her acceptance of the appellant’s explanation,
    she again returned to her earlier position:
    “However, the plaintiff has failed to provide a reasonable excuse for the <i>overall
    delay</i> in this action, including the period from June&nbsp;30,&nbsp;2004”
    [emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge then turned to the issue of prejudice, noting that inordinate
    delay “since the cause of action arose” gave rise to a presumption of prejudice
    on the part of the defendant.  This presumption placed a burden on the dilatory
    plaintiff to show that, despite the delay, there was no substantial risk
    that the defendant would be deprived of a fair trial.  The motion judge found
    that the appellant had not satisfied the burden for the following reasons
    in paragraphs 20 and 21:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In this case, the presumption of prejudice is a
    strong one, given the length of the delay.&nbsp; The limitation period expired
    in August, 1998, and a trial date is not likely before November, 2006, at
    the earliest.&nbsp; The memories of witnesses are bound to have suffered
    over a period which will be over nine years from the first treatment to the
    time of trial.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The plaintiff <i>has not put forward evidence</i> which
    would rebut the presumption of prejudice. &nbsp;This is not a document case,
    and the memories of the witnesses will have been affected by the lengthy
    passage of time [emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge next considered actual prejudice sustained by the respondent
    physicians.  At paragraphs 22 and 23 she concluded that they had proved that
    they had sustained actual prejudice:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Moreover, there <i>is evidence from the defendant
      physicians of actual prejudice</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Saikaley, supra, </i>Hollingworth
      J., quoting from Denning J. in <i>Bliss v. Lambeth, Southwark &amp; Lewisham
      Health Authority</i>, recognized that a defendant can be prejudiced because
      of the ongoing effect of an unresolved action on his or her life (at p.
      636).&nbsp; Both physicians are of the belief that their memory of events
      has faded.&nbsp; As well, <i>they have given evidence of prejudice</i> in
      the form of damage to reputation, because of the annual need to report
      notice of this malpractice action on their hospital privilege applications,
      as well as stress and anxiety. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The plaintiff argued that this type of prejudice
    should be ignored, as many defendants suffer stress and damage to their reputation
    as a result of litigation.&nbsp; However, the prejudice suffered here is
    not just the prejudice experienced because of the litigation, but the added
    damage to reputation and stress caused by the prolonged nature of this particular
    action [emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I understand her analysis and reasons, it appears that the motion judge dismissed
    the appellant’s claim against the physicians because:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;

    test for dismissal of an action for delay is not in dispute.  In my view,
    it is correctly stated at paragraph 4 of the reasons of the Divisional Court
    in an appeal from the master in <i>Woodheath Developments Ltd. v. Goldman</i> (2003),
    66 O.R. (3d) 731 at 732:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Specifically, I accept as correct the principles
    applicable to motions to dismiss for delay derived by the learned Master
    from the case law and accurately summarized in the headnote at (2001), 56
    O.R. (3d) 658 as follows:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>The principle to be applied on a motion to
    dismiss for delay is that the action should not be dismissed unless: (1)
    the default is intentional and contumelious; or (2) the plaintiff or his
    or her lawyers are responsible for the inexcusable delay that gives rise
    to a substantial risk that a fair trial might not now be possible.  It is
    presumed that memories fade over time, and an inordinate delay after the
    cause of action arose or after the passage of limitation period gives rise
    to a presumption of prejudice.  Where there is a presumption of prejudice,
    the defendant need not lead actual evidence of prejudice and the action will
    be dismissed for delay unless the plaintiff rebuts the presumption. The presumption
    of prejudice may be rebutted by evidence that all documentary evidence has
    been preserved and the issues in the lawsuit do not depend on the recollection
    of witnesses or that all necessary witnesses are available with detailed
    recollection of the events.  If the presumption is rebutted then the action
    may still be dismissed if the defendant leads convincing evidence of actual
    prejudice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Belanger
      v. Southwestern Insulation Contractors Ltd.</i> (1993), 16 O.R. (3d) 457
      (Gen. Div.), which was approved by this court in <i>Christie Corp. v. Lee </i>(1999),
      29 C.P.C. (4th) 181 (Ont. C.A.), I had occasion to consider the factors
      to be taken into account by the court on a Rule&nbsp;24 motion for the
      dismissal of an action for delay at pp.&nbsp;471-472:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is unnecessary to review the many cases which
    have discussed the factors to be considered by the court on a motion to dismiss
    an action for delay or for want of prosecution.  Nor is it necessary to consider
    the relatively rare case where the plaintiff’s delay was intentional and
    contumelious.  In order to succeed on a motion to dismiss a plaintiff’s claim
    for delay the defendant must establish that the delay has been unreasonable
    in the sense that it is inordinate and inexcusable and that there is a substantial
    risk that a fair trial will not be possible for the defendant at the time
    the action is tried if it is allowed to continue.  The second part of this
    proposition is often expressed as the likelihood of prejudice to the defendant
    giving rise to a substantial risk that a fair trial will not be possible
    when the case is actually tried.  Examples of prejudice are the death of
    a witness, the inability to locate a witness, the inability of a witness
    to recall important facts or the loss of important evidence.  In determining
    whether the delay has been unreasonable the court should consider the issues
    raised by the case, the complexity of the issues, the explanation for the
    delay and all relevant surrounding circumstances.  In considering whether
    the defendant has sustained prejudice the court should consider the availability
    of its witnesses, whether the evidence is largely documentary or based on
    the recollection of individuals, the efforts made by the defendant to preserve
    its evidence and any other relevant consideration.  Prejudice to the defendant
    is to be considered relative to the time the case will likely be reached
    for trial if permitted to proceed.  The court will then balance the right
    of the plaintiff to proceed to trial with the defendant’s right to a fair
    trial and make its decision: see, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Allen v. Sir Alfred McAlpine &amp; Sons
    Ltd</i>., [1968] 1 All E.R. 543, [1968] 2 Q.B. 229 (C.A.); <i>Clairmonte

    now turn to the appellant’s first ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three
    judges of the Superior Court of Justice concluded that the respondents had
    not satisfied the test for dismissing an action for delay.  On March&nbsp;7,&nbsp;2003
    Sachs&nbsp;J. found that “the threshold necessary for such an order [had]
    not been met”.  However, in setting a timetable for the prosecution of the
    action she said that the defendants could renew their motion for delay if
    the plaintiff failed to comply with the timetable that she set.  On September&nbsp;23,&nbsp;2003
    B.&nbsp;Wright&nbsp;J. dismissed a further motion to dismiss the plaintiff’s
    action for delay.  Although the plaintiff’s counsel had not fully complied
    with the timetable of Sachs&nbsp;J., Wright&nbsp;J. was reluctant to dismiss
    the action due to the failure of his counsel to move the action forward.  He
    ordered that the examinations for discovery of the hospital representatives
    be completed by October&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2003, and that the action be set down
    for trial by December&nbsp;30,&nbsp;2003.  In my view, Sachs&nbsp;J. and
    B.&nbsp;Wright&nbsp;J. must be taken as having accepted the appellant’s explanation
    for his delay. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defendant hospitals moved for leave to appeal to the Divisional Court from
    the order of B.&nbsp;Wright&nbsp;J.  On February&nbsp;20,&nbsp;2004, in reasons
    reported at [2004] O.J. No.&nbsp;686, O’Driscoll&nbsp;J. dismissed the motion.  Nothing
    caused him “to have any doubt, let alone ‘good reason to doubt’, the correctness
    of the…order of B.&nbsp;Wright&nbsp;J.”  O’Driscoll&nbsp;J. added at paragraph
    10 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, with respect, the order of B.&nbsp;Wright&nbsp;J.
    is steeped in wisdom and common sense.  He was well aware that a medical
    malpractice lawsuit is not a forum for counsel and/or their staff to play “chicken” and/or
    “closest to the line”.  Whatever antipathy that may exist between and amongst
    counsels must not be allowed to cloud counsels’ duty to the court and to
    his/her client.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>As the timetable set by the order
    of B.&nbsp;Wright&nbsp;J. had not been met as a result of the hospitals’ motion
    for leave to appeal, O’Driscoll&nbsp;J. varied the timetable by requiring
    the plaintiff to set the action down for trial by June&nbsp;30,&nbsp;2004.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    two judges are to be taken as having found that the test for dismissal for
    delay had not been met, and as O’Driscoll&nbsp;J. did not doubt the correctness
    of the order of B.&nbsp;Wright&nbsp;J., one issue is whether the motion judge
    in her analysis placed too much emphasis on the period from the commencement
    of the action until the date of the motion before her.  This raises the question:
    what happened in the 17 months from the release of O’Driscoll&nbsp;J.’s reasons
    on February&nbsp;20,&nbsp;2004 until the hearing before the motion judge
    that tipped the scales in favour of the defendants?  If the delay was taken
    by O’Driscoll&nbsp;J. to be excusable on February&nbsp;20,&nbsp;2004, what
    was it that worsened the defendants’ position thereafter?  In my view, there
    is nothing in the record that shows that the subsequent delay worsened the
    situation so far as the defendants were concerned.  Indeed, when the motion
    was argued before Swinton&nbsp;J. the action had already been set down for
    trial and the trial co&#8209;ordinator was awaiting the co&#8209;operation
    of counsel for the physicians to provide available dates for trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the first two motions, the defendants did not introduce evidence that they
    had sustained actual prejudice.  It was first introduced on the third motion
    in an affidavit sworn on April&nbsp;8,&nbsp;2005 by Sarit Batner, a lawyer
    employed by the law firm that represents the physicians.  This is an affidavit
    on information and belief, as permitted by rule&nbsp;39.01(4).  The sources
    of the information were Dr.&nbsp;McCall and Dr.&nbsp;Whaley who advised Ms.&nbsp;Batner
    of how they had been affected by the delay, including the effect on their
    memories.  As I will discuss, in the circumstances of this case, the motion
    judge should not have relied on this portion of the affidavit.  Thus, on
    a proper consideration of the record, I cannot see how the lapse of time
    between the release of O’Driscoll&nbsp;J.’s reasons on February&nbsp;20,&nbsp;2004
    and the affidavit of Sarit Batner of April&nbsp;8,&nbsp;2005 worsened the
    respondents’ position and put them at a disadvantage in obtaining a fair
    trial of the issues.  While they may have informed Ms.&nbsp;Batner that they
    were prejudiced in the sense of having had the action “hanging over their
    heads” for a lengthy period to time, assuming the admissibility of this portion
    of her affidavit, in my view this was not relevant to their ability to obtain
    a fair trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    it was not wrong for the motion judge to consider “the whole course” of the
    action in determining whether it should have been dismissed, as the appellant
    contended, given that the respondents had failed to establish a fatal delay
    before Sachs&nbsp;J. and B.&nbsp;Wright&nbsp;J, she should have focused on
    the delay subsequent to the decision of O’Driscoll&nbsp;J.  The question
    which the court must address is whether delay that is properly described
    as inordinate and inexcusable has given rise to a substantial risk that a
    fair trial for the defendant will not be possible.  In the unusual circumstances
    of this case there were two concurrent findings – on March&nbsp;7,&nbsp;2003
    and September&nbsp;23,&nbsp;2003 – that the plaintiff had not engaged in
    inordinate and inexcusable delay.  In the absence of a finding of grounds
    on which the delay subsequently became inordinate and inexcusable, not to
    mention the absence of direct evidence concerning the fairness of the trial,
    it cannot be right, in my judgment, for the court to dismiss the action for
    delay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the motion judge’s error was the same as that of the motion judge
    in <i>Christie Corp. v. Lee</i>, <i>supra</i>.  I would adopt and apply what
    this court said at paragraph&nbsp;4 to the circumstances of this case:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In some cases, under Rule&nbsp;24, it will be appropriate
    to consider the time elapsed from the time an action was commenced in considering
    the reasonableness of the delay relied on by the defendant.  In the circumstances
    of this case, however, it is our view that the motions judge erred in principle
    in placing undue weight on this factor.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>In that case, as the delay was the
    result of the plaintiff’s failure to set the action down for trial within
    the required six months, the court was of the view that the proper starting
    time for measuring the delay was the date on which the action should have
    been set down for trial.  At paragraph&nbsp;7 the court added that it was
    significant that the evidence in respect to the claim and the defence was
    largely documentary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would also refer to <i>Saikaley v. Commonwealth Insurance Co.</i> (1978),
    21 O.R. (2d) 629 (H.C.J.) at 635 where the circumstances were similar to
    those in this case.  The master had granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss
    the action for delay, but on appeal was reversed by Van&nbsp;Camp&nbsp;J.  On
    a subsequent motion to dismiss the action, the same master denied the motion.  On
    appeal from that decision of the master, Hollingworth&nbsp;J. was of the
    opinion that the starting point for considering the delay was the date of
    Van&nbsp;Camp&nbsp;J.’s decision because “she properly dealt with the matter
    then, or must have taken the matter into consideration”.  Similarly, in this
    case, there were two judges, each of whom found that the factors necessary
    to dismiss the action for delay were absent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would, therefore, give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'>VIII</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the appellant that the motion judge erred in finding that the
    appellant had not rebutted the presumption of prejudice.  Noting that this
    is not a document case and assuming that the memories of the witnesses would
    have been affected by the lengthy passage of time, she found that the appellant
    had not put up any evidence which would rebut the presumption of prejudice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, in making this finding the motion judge overlooked very significant
    evidence.  As in a commercial case where documents may be reviewed by a witness  to
    refresh his or her memory, in this case the actual testimony of the physicians
    taken on their examinations for discovery in August,&nbsp;1999 was available
    if they required assistance in recalling what had occurred.  In addition,
    there is in fact a considerable body of relevant documentary evidence consisting
    of x&#8209;rays, CT scan reports, hospital admission records, clinical notes
    and records made by each physician, as well as the reports of the experts.  It
    follows that as there are numerous documents in this case in addition to
    the respondents’ examinations for discovery that took place at an early stage
    in the proceedings, the physicians could easily refresh their memories if
    necessary from these materials.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Starr v. Canadian Medical
    Laboratories Ltd.</i>, [2003] O.J. No. 2817 (Ont. C.A.) at para.&nbsp;4.  <i>Tiesmaki
    v. Wilson</i> (1971), 23 D.L.R. (3d) 179 (Alta. S.C. (A.D.)) is an example
    of a want of prosecution case in which the hospital records and witness statements
    of the defendants were considered adequate to enable the defendants to refresh
    their memories.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to failing to accord the appropriate weight to these factors, the
    motion judge also failed to do so with respect to the delay that was attributable
    to the defendants.  For example, it took from February&nbsp;13,&nbsp;2001
    to April&nbsp;26,&nbsp;2004 for the appellant to complete the examinations
    for discovery of the representatives of the hospitals, largely because of
    the lack of co&#8209;operation of counsel for the hospitals.  In addition,
    while it is arguable that there was a duty on the defendant physicians to
    move the case forward, I cannot leave this issue without observing that in
    my view it would been better had counsel for the physicians been less obsessed
    with the bringing of motions seeking to dismiss the action for delay, and
    more co&#8209;operative in such matters as providing dates when she was available
    for trial.  In this regard, it is significant that the action had been set
    down for trial when counsel argued her third motion to dismiss the action
    for delay.  At that time the parties had done everything necessary for the
    trial of the case on its merits.  The only thing that remained was for the
    trial co&#8209;ordinator to fix the trial date.  That the action had been
    set down for trial was a factor that this court took into consideration in <i>Clairmonte
    v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</i>, [1970] 3 O.R. 97 (C.A.) in dismissing
    an appeal from a motion judge who had allowed an appeal from the master who
    had dismissed an action for delay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, the motion judge was troubled by the fact that the earliest trial
    date appeared to be November&nbsp;2006, which was about 16 months after the
    hearing of the motion.  In my view, this systemic delay should not have been
    used against the appellant.  As an ameliorative measure to reduce further
    delay, and bearing in mind that the action had been set down for trial, it
    was open to the motion judge to order an expedited trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
    I would give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'>IX</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third ground of appeal is that the motion judge erred in finding that the
    respondents had proved actual prejudice.  In regard to this ground of appeal,
    it is important to note that in paragraphs&nbsp;22 and 23 of her reasons
    for judgment, which I have reproduced at paragraph&nbsp;9, the motion judge
    stated that the physicians had “given evidence” of prejudice.  The appellant’s
    position, with which I agree, is that there was no direct evidence of prejudice
    given by the physicians.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    finding that the respondents had “given evidence” of prejudice, it would
    appear that the motion judge relied on paragraphs 67 to 74 of the affidavit
    of April&nbsp;8,&nbsp;2005 sworn by Ms.&nbsp;Batner, who was their counsel.  In
    her affidavit, Ms.&nbsp;Batner makes reference to information which she had
    received from the physicians and states her belief in that information.  In
    addition to the stress and anxiety that they were experiencing as a result
    of the ongoing litigation, each physician informed Ms.&nbsp;Batner that his
    ability to recollect the facts of the case had been hindered by the passage
    of time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, what is contained in Ms.&nbsp;Batner’s affidavit does not constitute
    evidence “given” by the physicians on the motion heard by the motion judge.  With
    respect, she was wrong in characterizing it as such and in relying on it
    as if it were the physicians’ direct evidence.  In this regard, I would adopt
    the observations of Master Dash in <i>Woodheath Developments Ltd. v. Goldman</i> (2001),
    56 O.R. (3d) 658 (S.C.J.), aff’d (2003), 66 O.R. (3d) 731 (Div. Ct), which
    was a motion to dismiss an action for delay on the ground, <i>inter alia</i>,
    that the memories of two witnesses had deteriorated.  At paragraph 44 the
    master stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Unfortunately, the evidence before me respecting
    the memories of Mr.&nbsp;Gangbar and Mr.&nbsp;Libfeld comes from the affidavit
    of Theodore Rotenberg, the plaintiff’s solicitor in this action, who avers
    that each of Gangbar and Libfeld advised him that their recollections remain
    clear.  It would have been preferable if Mr.&nbsp;Gangbar and Mr.&nbsp;Libfield
    provided their own affidavits so that their memories could be tested by cross&#8209;examination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
    is contained in Ms.&nbsp;Batner’s affidavit is hearsay.  Although rule&nbsp;4.06(2)
    of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> restricts the contents of an affidavit
    to be used in a proceeding “to the statement of facts within the personal
    knowledge of the deponent or to other evidence that the deponent could give
    if testifying as a witness in court”, rule&nbsp;39.01(4) creates an exception.  It
    permits an affidavit “for use on a motion [to] contain statements of the
    deponent’s information and belief, if the source of the information and the
    fact of the belief are specified in the affidavit”.  However, I would note
    that in respect to affidavits for use on an application, rule&nbsp;39.01(5)
    restricts statements of the deponent’s information and belief to facts that
    are not contentious.  In addition, while rule&nbsp;20.02 permits an affidavit
    for use on a motion for summary judgment to be made on information and belief,
    the court is permitted to draw an adverse inference “from the failure of

    problem with an affidavit on information and belief is that the person who
    provided the information to the deponent is shielded from cross&#8209;examination.  No
    doubt that is why rules&nbsp;39.01(5) and 20.02 effectively preclude affidavits
    on information and belief in respect to contested facts.  In my view, a significant
    issue on the motion was the state of the physicians’ memories.  Yet they
    did not present an affidavit setting forth their personal knowledge.  This
    is why during argument the panel expressed its scepticism of the value of
    the “evidence” of the physicians’
    prejudice in Ms.&nbsp;Batner’s affidavit.  With respect, in my view the motion
    judge should also have been sceptical and should not have found that the
    defendant physicians had established actual prejudice on the basis of Ms.&nbsp;Batner’s
    affidavit.  They should have provided their own affidavit so that their memories
    could be tested by cross&#8209;examination.  I would note that in <i>Tiesmaki</i>,<i> supra</i>,
    the defendants’ filed affidavits about their failing memories.</p>

    in the end, there was no convincing evidence adduced by the physicians that
    the delay had caused them demonstrable prejudice.  In the absence of direct
    evidence by the physicians concerning their ability to recall significant
    events, there was no evidence in respect to:</p>

    there is any witness of material fact whose memory was not preserved in statement
    or documentary form during all relevant times.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>In my respectful view, in the absence
    of such evidence, a finding of actual prejudice based on untested hearsay
    evidence is not enough to justify the Draconian measure of depriving the
    appellant of an opportunity to attempt to prove his case on the merits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no doubt that a considerable period of time has elapsed since the appellant
    commenced his action.  As well, his counsel could have been more active in
    prosecuting his case.  However, this is not a case where the plaintiff sat
    idle after issuing his statement of claim.  When this motion was argued,
    everything had been completed by the parties and they were ready for trial.  Indeed,
    the plaintiff had set the action down for trial and all that remained was
    for the lawyer for the physicians to respond to the trial co&#8209;ordinator’s
    request for her available dates for trial.  Apparently counsel for the hospitals
    did not feel that there had been unwarranted delay as they never moved to
    dismiss the action for delay.  Indeed, were the action to be dismissed for
    delay, all the very considerable costs that have been incurred would be thrown
    away, and I think that would be most unfortunate.  In the final analysis,
    although there was considerable delay, in my view, the appellant has rebutted
    any presumption of prejudice, and the respondents have failed to provide
    convincing evidence of actual prejudice that they will be unable to have
    a fair trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    all of the foregoing reasons, I would allow the appeal and set aside the
    order of the motion judge dismissing his action, with costs of the motion
    and the appeal.  I   would fix the costs of the appeal on a partial indemnity
    basis in the amount of $20,000, including disbursements and GST. If counsel
    are unable to agree on the costs of the motion, they are to be assessed. </p>
