      Paul U. Rivard of the Superior Court of Justice (Summary Conviction Appeal
      Court) dated September 14, 2005 upholding the acquittal entered at trial.</span></h4>
  <h2>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown seeks leave to appeal the decision of a Summary Conviction Appeal Court
    judge upholding the respondent’s acquittal on a charge of operating a motor
    vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration exceeding the legal limit. The
    respondent represented himself at trial. However, at the request of the trial
    judge, a defence counsel present in the courtroom assisted him in making
    a s. 8 <i>Charter </i>application at the conclusion of the evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his ruling on the s. 8 <i>Charter </i>application, the trial judge concluded
    that the Crown had not established that the police officer had reasonable
    and probable grounds for making a breath demand. The trial judge’s conclusion
    was premised on a finding that it had not been established on an objective
    basis that the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the course of oral argument at trial, the trial Crown acknowledged that,
    in the absence of the respondent’s fail reading on an approved screening
    device, the police officer would not have had reasonable and probable grounds
    for making a breath demand. The facts relating to the administration of the
    approved screening device test are therefore important. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    police officer administered the approved screening device test to the respondent
    on July 31, 2001. The police officer testified that before doing so, he noticed
    that the device had last been calibrated on July 5, 2001 and that was outside
    his police department’s current practice of calibrating approved screening
    devices every two weeks. However, the police officer also stated that his
    department’s practice concerning frequency of calibration was far in excess
    of the manufacturer’s standard. In that respect, he stated during cross-examination
    that he had spoken to a representative of the manufacturer at a trade show
    and was told the devices only require calibration once every six months. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    police officer also testified that, before administering the test to the
    respondent, he self-tested the approved screening device and that it properly
    registered no alcohol. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    assessing the police officer’s evidence concerning his conversation with
    the manufacturer’s representative, the trial judge commented that it was
    hearsay and that it was not even clear whether the individual in question
    was a technician, a salesman or “the guy cleaning up the booth”. Further,
    the trial judge found that the evidence that the approved screening device
    had not been calibrated within departmental guidelines was some evidence
    that the machine was not in proper working order. In the result, the trial
    judge concluded  that it had not been established on an objective basis that
    the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, the Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge stated that the trial judge’s
    finding “that the evidence established that the basis for the reasonable
    and probable grounds ‘just wasn’t there’” was a finding of fact. Further,
    the Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge concluded that because the police
    officer knew the approved screening device had not been calibrated in accordance
    with police department guidelines, it was open to the trial judge to find
    that “the results of the roadside test were not sufficient to provide reasonable
    and probable grounds as required.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal to this court, the Crown contends that the trial judge erred by applying
    the wrong test in determining whether the officer had reasonable and probable
    grounds to demand a breath sample. In particular, the Crown submits that  the
    trial judge required the Crown to prove that the approved screening device
    that was used in this case (and which registered a fail) was in good working
    order when the police officer administered the test to the respondent. Further,
    the Crown contends that the Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge erred by
    failing to recognize that the trial judge applied the wrong test. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    accept the appellant’s submissions. We are satisfied that rather than simply
    assessing whether, on an objective basis, the officer had reasonable grounds
    for believing that the approved screening device was in good working order,
    the trial judge embarked on a consideration of whether the evidence established
    that the device was in good working order. We therefore agree that, in effect,
    the trial judge required the Crown to prove the device was in good working
    order. Further, because the trial judge applied the wrong test, his finding
    that the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds is tainted
    and cannot stand. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    we agree that the Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge erred in law by failing
    to recognize that the trial judge applied the wrong test. Further, the Summary
    Conviction Appeal Court judge erred in law in holding that the trial judge’s
    conclusion that the police officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds
    on an objective basis was, in the circumstances of this case, a finding of
    fact. See <i>R. v. M.A.L.</i>, [2003] O.J. No. 1050 (C.A.).<i> </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    oral argument on the appeal, the Crown fairly acknowledged that, if the appeal
    was allowed the proper remedy would be a new trial. Accordingly, leave to
    appeal is granted, the judgment of the Summary Conviction Appeal Court and
    the acquittal entered at trial are set aside and a new trial is ordered.</p>
