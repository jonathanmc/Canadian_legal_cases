style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In April 2003, the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing
    (“the Minister”) established a single development planning area in the City of
    Pickering under the <i>Ontario Planning and Development Act,</i> <i>1994</i>,
    S.O. 1994, c.23 (“the <i>OPDA</i>”).  As
    required by s.&nbsp;2(3) of the <i>OPDA</i>, the Minister commissioned an
    investigation and survey to be undertaken of the environmental, physical,
    social and economic conditions affecting the development planning area.  The Minister engaged Planning Alliance, a
    consulting firm, to undertake the study and to engage in public consultation as
    required by s.&nbsp;4(1) of the <i>OPDA</i>.  The Minister mandated Planning Alliance to “cause a proposed development
    plan for the planning area to be prepared”, as required by s.&nbsp;2(3) of the <i>Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Duffin brought an application for judicial review of the
    statutory power of decision exercised by the Minister under the <a
name="OLE_LINK1"><i>OPDA</i></a> on the basis that the Minister had breached
    ss.&nbsp;2(3) and 4(1) of the <i>Act</i>.  In a decision dated May 24, 2005, the Divisional Court quashed Duffin’s
    application as premature.</p>

line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Duffin appealed with leave.  On May 4, 2006, at the commencement of the hearing, counsel advised the
    Court that on the previous day the Minister had recommended that the Lieutenant
    Governor in Council approve the Central Pickering Development Plan and that an
    Order in Council was issued the same day.  As a result, the prematurity issue had essentially dissolved.  However, the Court decided that it would
    stay seized of the appeal and hear it on the merits.  The hearing was adjourned to June 26, 2006 to enable the parties
    to supplement the record and to prepare and file supplementary facta.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Duffin advances two arguments on the appeal: (1) the
    Minister’s initial reference to Planning Alliance breached s.&nbsp;2(3) of the <i>OPDA</i>;
    and (2) the process established by the Minister led to the breach of the
    “public participation” component of the process mandated by s.&nbsp;4(1) of the <i>Act</i>.</p>

    Minister made some initial decisions about the development planning area that
    would be the subject of the investigation and survey.  The most important decision was the instruction to Planning
    Alliance:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>The new community of North Pickering
    will consist of an urbanized portion with a significant amount of preserved
    natural heritage lands generally located in the area known as Seaton, and an

    Agricultural Reserve.</span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The Province is

    Agricultural Reserve.  The effect of the
    Minister’s instruction was that the possible development of the appellant’s
    Cherrywood lands was effectively taken off the table.  The Cherrywood lands would continue to be restricted to
    agricultural use.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Minister’s instruction must be assessed in light of

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>2(1)            The

line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the Minister’s instruction to the
    effect that the preservation of the Cherrywood lands for agricultural uses was
    a ‘given’ breached s.&nbsp;2(3)(a) of the <i>OPDA</i>.  The core of the appellant’s submission on
    this issue is succinctly set out at para.&nbsp;46 of its factum:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The obligations
    imposed by s.&nbsp;2(3) are mandatory and the Minister cannot derogate from the
    requirement that a proposed development plan be prepared.  Nor can he impose restrictions or
    limitations to the type of investigation to be carried out or to prejudge or
    predetermine the elements of the plan to be prepared.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not agree with the appellant’s contention that an
    investigation and survey conducted pursuant to s.&nbsp;2(3)(a) of the <i>OPDA</i> must be unrestricted or open&#8209;ended.  Indeed, in my view, the purpose, policy and language of the Act
    support the conclusion that it is entirely acceptable for the Minister to set
    certain parameters for an investigation and survey.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The modern principle of statutory interpretation is that the words
    of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and
    ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of Act, and
    the intention of the legislature: see <i>Re Rizzo and Rizzo Shoes Ltd.</i>,
    [1989] 1 S.C.R. 27 at 43.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The provisions of the <i>OPDA</i> make it clear that the
    scheme of the <i>Act</i> is intended to confer a broad policy discretion on
    both the Minister and Cabinet in creating a development plan.  Section&nbsp;2(3) authorizes the Minister to
    designate a development planning area and to cause an investigation and survey
    to be conducted with respect to all or “any part” of the area.  Section&nbsp;3(d) of the <i>Act</i> provides
    that a development plan may contain such policies as the Minister considers
    advisable.  Sections&nbsp;13 and 15 of
    the <i>Act</i> provide that a development plan established under the <i>OPDA</i> overrides conflicting municipal plans and by&#8209;laws.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant asserts that the Minister restricted the scope
    of the investigation and survey of the development planning area for three reasons
    – to retain the Cherrywood lands for agricultural use, to supersede local
    planning initiatives undertaken by the City of Pickering, and to accommodate a
    land exchange between the provincial Government and developers who owned land
    in the Oak Ridges Moraine.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accepting the accuracy of the appellant’s description of the
    Minister’s motivation for invoking the <i>OPDA</i> and for structuring the
    investigation and survey in the fashion he chose, I see nothing improper in the
    Minister’s conduct.  Nor does the
    Minister’s decision come close to being a breach of s.&nbsp;2(3) of the <i>OPDA</i>.  The Cherrywood lands have been preserved for
    agricultural use for many years and by successive NDP, Conservative and Liberal
    governments.  The Government is
    permitted to take steps to safeguard that designation.  In 2003, the City of Pickering took steps
    that had the potential to call into question that designation.  One of the core purposes of the <i>OPDA</i> is to permit the provincial Government to step in and override municipal
    processes and decisions that run counter to provincial land use policy.  Finally, the land exchange, whereby Seaton
    would be open for development while the Oak Ridges Moraine would not, is
    precisely the type of broader land use policy decision involving more than one
    municipality and more than one land use (development, parkland, heritage sites)
    that is well&#8209;suited to resolution by the provincial Government.  The <i>OPDA</i> simply provides the
    mechanism.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    component of the appellant’s complaint is set out in para.&nbsp;60 of its
    factum:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>The Appellant experienced first hand
    the futility of expressing its opinion regarding the proposed development plan
    during the initial preparation stage.  The Appellant’s counsel and professional engineer attended one of the
    meetings that purported to be open to the public for consultation and asked the
    study team whether it had considered urban development for the Cherrywood
    lands.  The study team responded that
    “of course” it had not considered urban development on “the west side of the
    site” (i.e. Cherrywood) as the Cherrywood lands were intended to be “an
    agricultural preserve in perpetuity”.  It is clear that the study team would not consider urban development for
    Cherrywood given that the terms of the reference imposed by the Minister
    specifically mandated the study team not to.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my
    view, this complaint about non&#8209;participation dissolves with the
    resolution of the first issue.  If the
    Minister is entitled to define the contours of the investigation and survey to
    be conducted under s.&nbsp;2(3)(a) of the <i>OPDA</i>, then proffered opinions
    to Planning Alliance completely outside, or antithetical to, its defined
    contours are meaningless.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Similar
    reasoning also serves as a response to another complaint by the appellant,
    namely, that while it was included in some meetings, it was not invited to the
    “by invitation only” meetings with various stakeholders.  If “Cherrywood shall remain agricultural” is
    a permissible ‘given’ in the planning process, the party conducting the
    investigation and survey for the Minister is not required to invite an entity
    whose only interest and message is “Cherrywood should be urbanized”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally,
    I note that there was nothing to prevent the appellant from responding to the
    open call for submissions about the development plan.  The appellant conducted many studies of the lands in
    question.  It was open to the appellant
    to submit these studies and to make submissions to the Minister with a view to
    persuading the Minister that his ‘given’ concerning the Cherrywood lands should
    be changed.</span></p>
