style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Wright appeals from the sentence of eight years’
    imprisonment imposed by Justice Peter Howden following his guilty plea to
    charges of robbery with a firearm and being disguised with intent to commit an
    indictable offence.  The offences took
    place in the context of a home invasion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In imposing his sentence of eight years’ imprisonment the
    trial judge concluded that the five-to-eight-year range for home invasions
    referred to by this court in <i>R. v. Wang</i><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span>[1]</span></span></a> and <i>R v. Ferreira</i><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span>[2]</span></span></a><i> </i>had subsequently moved up to something
    in the area of seven to ten or eleven years on the basis that “the Court is
    having to recognize that this kind of offence merits greater punishment.”  Mr. Goddard – who was of great assistance to
    us in this case – submits on behalf of the appellant that the trial judge erred
    in this conclusion and that this error influenced his decision to impose an
    eight-year term rather than a lesser period of imprisonment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this respect, Mr. Goddard argues that a review of the trial
    judge’s reasons indicates he wished to place the appellant’s sentence at the
    lower end of the appropriate range, whatever that range was.  By extension he argues that had the trial
    judge applied the appropriate range of five to eight years, he would have
    concluded that a proper sentence for Mr. Wright was six years’ imprisonment
    instead of eight.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, however, I would not interfere

  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 26, 2004, five men, armed with handguns and wearing
    gloves and disguises, committed a home invasion at the residence of the owner
    of a small business, Mr. Fuda.  They
    surrounded Mr. Fuda in his driveway when he returned from work.  The ultimate objective of the attack was to
    rob his business premises, which were located elsewhere.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With that objective in mind, the intruders forced Mr. Fuda to
    take them into the family home.  When
    inside, they gathered his family in the living room, and confined them there –
    Mrs. Fuda, the couple’s twenty and twenty-three year old daughters, their
    eleven-year-old son, and a nanny – while they carried out their plan of
    extracting the information necessary to facilitate access to the safe at his
    store.  Mr. Fuda was compelled to hand
    over the keys to the office premises, and to write out the alarm code and the
    combination for the safe on a piece of paper.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The confinement continued for approximately forty-five minutes
    while one of the men went to the business premises to open the safe.  When he was unsuccessful in doing so, he
    called back to the home and demanded the correct information from Mr. Fuda,
    threatening to hurt him and his family if the correct information was not
    provided.  The appellant and one of the
    other intruders held their guns to Mr. Fuda while he was on the phone with the
    robber at the store, and one of them told him: “Make sure you tell him the
    right combination or else you’re gonna get hurt.”  This intimidation took place within earshot of the family huddled
    in the living room.  The daughter,
    Sarah, could hear her father crying in the hallway.  In these circumstances, the threat to hurt Mr. Fuda and his
    family could only have been interpreted to mean that he, or they, were going to
    be shot and killed or, at least, seriously injured. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the intruders targeted Mr. Fuda and his family with
    the objective of robbing Mr. Fuda’s business premises, they also took
    approximately $950 in cash and some other items were also taken from the home.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The ordeal ended when the police arrived at the home and the

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Wright pleaded guilty to the charges he faced, and the
    trial judge sentenced him to a total of eight years imprisonment.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time of his sentencing, the appellant was twenty-seven
    years of age.  He has a prior criminal
    record involving three convictions for theft under $5,000 (one as a youth), one
    conviction for attempted theft under $5,000, and one conviction for failure to
    attend court.  His last convictions
    prior to the events giving rise to this appeal were in relation to acts that
    occurred in 1998.  He is strongly
    supported by the mother of his two-year-old child and by his own mother, as
    well as by many friends and acquaintances, all of whom view the home invasion
    conduct as “out of character.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge quite correctly observed that home invasion
    offences of this kind “must be recognized by the courts as serious and
    denounced as totally unacceptable in a civilized society.”  As a corollary, he rightly noted that he
    must give priority to the sentencing objectives of deterrence and
    denunciation.  He also recognized,
    however, that Mr. Wright was entitled to be judged on his own merits and that
    his prospects for rehabilitation must be taken into account.  He was impressed with the remorse the
    appellant had demonstrated in his statement to the court prior to sentencing,
    as well as the appellant’s empathy for his victims, his understanding of the
    seriousness of what he had done, his desire to make amends, and his willingness
    to face his sentence responsibly.  The
    trial judge commented that he had “seldom heard from the dock a more insightful
    statement of what an accused has caused by his conduct.”</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>            <u><span
style='font-weight:normal'>Home Invasion</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Home invasion is a serious, and increasingly prevalent, crime
    in our society.  For a discussion of its
    essential nature and the variety of circumstances “home invasion” can embrace,
    see <i>R. v. S. (J).</i> (2006), 210 C.C.C.
    (3d) 296 (Ont. C.A.).  The crime
    committed by Mr. Wright constitutes a home invasion because it was characterized
    by the invaders’ forced entry into the victims’ home <span lang=EN-US>for purposes of committing a theft or robbery,
    knowing that (or being reckless as to whether) the home was being occupied, and
    by the accompanying use or threatened use of violence with guns, together with
    the confinement of the occupants of the home.</span> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As this court also noted in <i>S. (J).</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para.
    34, home invasion offences are particularly troubling “<span lang=EN-US>because they represent a violation of the
    sanctity of the home and of the sense of security people feel when in their
    homes – highly cherished values in our society – and because they are
    frequently perpetrated against vulnerable individuals.”  They must therefore be dealt with sternly by
    the courts.  This concern was eloquently
    captured by Trafford J. in <i>R. v. Soares</i>,
    [1996] O.J. No. 5488 (S.C.J.)<a href="#_ftn5"
name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[5]</span></a> at para. 286:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US>The sanctity of one’s home is of fundamental
    importance in a free and democratic society.  It is constitutionally recognized in our country.  Everyone must not only be, but feel, secure
    in their residence.  A society that
    tolerates significant criminal intrusions into the privacy of one’s home is a
    society that forces it citizens to resort to self-help to protect themselves
    against such wrongs.  Absent effective
    responses from the judiciary, the alternative is for citizens to arm themselves
    in anticipation of a need to defend themselves against such criminal
    enterprises.  A society like that is not
    ours today, has not been ours in the past, and will not be ours in the
    future.  The obligation of the Court is
    to give proper recognition to the sanctity of the home, to protect all citizens
    against such intrusions, and to thereby preserve the public’s confidence in the
    administration of justice.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, a lengthy penitentiary term is fully
    warranted upon conviction for a home invasion offence: <i>R v. Nelson (M.)</i>, (2001), 147 O.A.C. 358 at para. 15 (C.A.).  This appeal raises the issue of the
    appropriate “range” of that penitentiary term, in the context of the fitness of
    the sentence imposed by the trial judge.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'><u><span
style='font-weight:normal'>&nbsp; </span></u></h3>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'><u><span
style='font-weight:normal'>The “Range” of Sentence</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sentencing “ranges” are useful in promoting the “parity”
    principle because they provide guidelines to trial judges for the imposition of
    similar penalties for similar offences of a similar nature involving similar
    offenders: see <i>R. v. McDonnell</i>,
    [1997] 1 S.C.R. 948; and <i>R. v. Stone</i>,
    [1999] 2 S.C.R. 290.  As Finch C.J.B.C.
    pointed out in <i>R. v. A.J.C.</i> (2004),
    186 C.C.C. (3d) 227 at para. 36 (B.C.C.A.), relying on <i>R. v. Bernier</i> (2003), 177 C.C.C. (3d) 137 (B.C.C.A.), they are
    nothing more than guidelines and are certainly not conclusive of the
    appropriate sentence in any given case.  Each sentencing must be conducted as an individualized exercise.  This point was underscored by Moldaver J.A.
    in <i>R. v. D. (D.)</i> (2002), 163 C.C.C.
    (3d) 471 at para. 33 (Ont. C.A.):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left'>Before going any further, I wish to emphasize that the ranges which I
    have identified are not meant to be fixed and inflexible.  On the contrary, sentencing is not an exact
    science and trial judges must retain the flexibility needed to do justice in
    individual cases.  The suggested ranges
    are merely guidelines designed to assist trial judges in their difficult task
    of fashioning fit and just sentences in similar cases.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, as Finch C.J.B.C. also noted, “the task of
    arriving at appropriate ‘ranges’ of sentence for ‘home invasion’ type crimes is
    particularly difficult, given the different combinations of offences that may
    actually be committed” (<i>A.J.C.</i>, at
    para 36): see also, <i>R. v. Bernier, supra</i>; <i>R. v. S.J., supra</i>, at para. 36; <i>R.
    v. Pakoo</i> (2004), 198 C.C.C. (3d) 122 (Man C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it is the elastic nature of the home invasion offence,
    and the myriad of circumstances to which the label may apply, that make it
    difficult to define a range of sentence for such a crime.  In my view, however, the trial judge was
    correct to observe that this court, and other appellate courts, have imposed
    sentences that exceed the five-to-eight-year range the appellant contends
    governs such cases, and that they have done so since the decisions in <i>Wang</i> (2001) and<i> Ferreira</i> (1997), upon which that range is said to rest.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Nelson (M.), supra,</i> (2001 – post <i>Wang</i>), this court
    (Doherty, Rosenberg and Moldaver JJ.A.) imposed a sentence of approximately
    nine years’ imprisonment in circumstances involving a pepper spray assault of
    the home invasion victim but which were otherwise not dissimilar to the present
    circumstances and which featured a young man with a minor criminal record as
    the offender.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[6]</span></a>  In <i>R.
    v. Soares, supra </i>(1998), this court upheld a sentence of nine years’
    imprisonment imposed by the trial judge in circumstances somewhat more serious
    than those in the present case.  In <i>R. v. Harriott </i>(2002), 161 C.C.C. (3d)
    481 (Ont. C.A.), affirmed [2003] 1 S.C.R. 39, MacPherson J.A. (Charron J.A.,
    concurring) sustained a penalty of the equivalent of eleven years’ imprisonment
    (taking into account pre-trial custody) for an offence similar to that
    committed in <i>Soares</i>.  Justice Nordheimer imposed a sentence of ten
    years’ imprisonment for a home invasion involving robbery with a firearm, in <i>R. v. D.W.</i>, [2004] O.J. No. 5825
    (S.C.J.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>A.J.C.</i>,<i> supra,</i> – a home invasion case in which
    the perpetrators entered the home armed with (unloaded) shotguns, pepper-spray
    and a knife, bound the inhabitants (and gagged one of them) and threatened them
    in an attempt to extort $50,000 – the British Columbia Court of Appeal reduced
    sentences of fourteen and sixteen years imprisonment to eleven and thirteen
    years.  Finch C.J.B.C. concluded that the
    eleven and thirteen year sentences were appropriate and noted that longer
    sentences of fourteen or fifteen years were more appropriate “in the most
    aggravated circumstances where a ‘home invasion’ involves not only a break and
    enter to commit robbery, the terrorizing and confinement of victims, and the
    use of weapons to achieve these objectives, but also the infliction of serious
    injuries, sexual assault or death” (para. 41).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, I think it can be said that the courts – including this
    one – have moved away from the notion of a firm “range” of five to eight years’
    imprisonment for crimes involving home invasions.  The trial judge did not err in so concluding.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Ranges” are not embedded in stone.  Given their nature as guidelines only, I do not view them as
    being fixed in law, as is the case with binding legal principles.  They may be altered deliberately, after
    careful consideration, by the courts.  Or, they may be altered practically, as a consequence of a series of
    decisions made by the courts which have that effect.  If a range moves by virtue of the application of individual cases
    over time, it is not necessary to overrule an earlier range that may once have
    been in vogue; it is only necessary to recognize that the courts have adapted
    and the guidelines have changed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The cases to which we have been referred, and which my own
    research has uncovered, reflect a gamut of sentencing dispositions in “home
    invasion” cases from as low as four or five years,<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[7]</span></a> to as high as eleven to thirteen years<a
href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[8]</span></a> – with the suggestion that even higher sentences may be reserved for situations
    involving kidnapping, the infliction of serious injuries, sexual assault or
    death.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[9]</span></a>  Whether a “range” of that elasticity is of
    much assistance to trial judges in their efforts to preserve sentencing parity
    for similar offences involving similar offenders – apart from signalling that a
    significant penitentiary jail term is generally called for – is not clear to
    me.  The downside of attempting to articulate
    a range for a type of crime that can manifest itself in such a wide variety of
    ways, and be committed by such a wide variety of individuals, is that the
    “range” becomes so broad, it is virtually meaningless.  Nonetheless, to the extent there can be said
    to be a range in home invasion cases, it would appear that the one that
    currently exists is the expansive one outlined above.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, however, “home invasion” cases call for a
    particularly nuanced approach to sentencing.  They require a careful examination of the circumstances of the particular
    case in question, of the nature and severity of the criminal acts perpetrated
    in the course of the home invasion, and of the situation of the individual
    offender.  Whether a case falls within
    the existing guidelines or range – or, indeed, whether it may be one of those
    exceptional cases that falls outside the range and results in a moving of the
    yardsticks – will depend upon the results of such an examination.  I agree with the British Columbia Court of
    Appeal in <i>A.J.C.</i> (at para. 29),
    however, that in cases of this nature the objectives of protection of the
    public, general deterrence and denunciation should be given priority, although
    of course the prospects of the offender’s rehabilitation and the other factors
    pertaining to sentencing must also be considered.  Certainly, a stiff penitentiary sentence is generally called for.</p>

    sentence that was unfit because it was outside the accepted range for similar
    crimes committed by similar offenders.  Rather, the complaint is that the trial judge misconstrued what the
    accepted range was.  For the reasons
    outlined above, I am not persuaded that he erred in concluding that the range
    has moved in recent years.  Nor am I
    persuaded – for the reasons that follow – that the sentence was unfit in the
    circumstances or that the trial judge would have imposed a lesser sentence if
    he had found the lower end of the range remained in the five-year zone.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Goddard submits that, in sentencing the appellant to eight
    years’ imprisonment, the trial judge was attempting to fit the sentence into
    the low end of a range he erroneously placed at between seven and ten or eleven
    years.  Had he appreciated that the
    range remained between five and eight years, the argument goes, the trial judge
    would accordingly have sentenced the appellant to something in the
    neighbourhood of six years in order to position the sentence near the low end
    of the range.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the trial judge does not say that he was attempting
    to place the appellant’s sentence at the low end of the range, and after
    reviewing the transcript of the sentencing proceedings and argument, and the
    trial judge’s reasons, I am not convinced that his decision was made with that
    intention.  Rather, I read the trial
    judge’s decision as focusing on the <i>high
    end</i> of the range, which he took – correctly, in my view – to have moved
    away from the eight years referred to by this court in cases like <i>Wang</i> and <i>Ferreira</i>.  Having earlier noted
    in his reasons that “<u>Nelson</u> appears to open that range <u>at the higher
    end</u> and on a case by case basis”<a
href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[10]</span></a>,
    he said at the end of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='
text-align:left'>After <u>Regina</u> v. <u>Nelson</u> I do not see the eight years in <u>Wang </u>as the high end of
    the range which more realistically now, I think, is in the area of seven to ten
    or 11 years after cases like <u>Regina v. ACJ</u> (2004) BCJ No. 964 (BCCA)
    which I recognize was from British Columbia but, given the statement in <u>Nelson</u><a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[11]</span></a> I think the Court is having to recognize that this kind of offence merits
    greater punishment.  As well, however,
    we are dealing with this particular accused and not all five and certainly not
    most of the others who seem to be career criminals.</p>

line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is not apparent where the trial judge’s reference to seven
    years in the foregoing passage came from,<a
href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[12]</span></a> but I am not persuaded from his reasons and the transcript, read as a whole,
    that he intended to sentence Mr. Wright in relation to the low end of the
    range.  Having regard to Mr. Wright’s
    plea, his obvious remorse, his desire to make amends and his willingness to
    take responsibility for his actions – but also having regard for the need for
    deterrence and denunciation – the trial judge decided that he would sentence
    the appellant to a period that was below the upper end of penalties approved by
    this court since those in <i>Wang</i> and <i>Ferreira</i>, but still significant enough
    to signal the court’s recognition “that this kind of offence merits greater
    punishment” and to reflect this court’s observation in <i>Nelson (M.)</i> that lengthy penitentiary terms are fully warranted in
    these types of cases.  I do not think he
    was in error in doing so.  </p>

    in terms of the gravity of the acts committed during the crime, this was
    nonetheless a very serious crime.  It
    was planned and the Fudas were targeted.  The victims were forcibly confined and terrorized at gunpoint, and
    subjected to significant emotional and psychological distress.  The father was told by people accompanying
    him and carrying guns that he would be “hurt” (which could only mean “shot”) if
    he did not co-operate and if he did not give the invaders the correct
    information to enable them to access the safe.  This form of intimidation took place within full earshot of the rest of
    the family – including an eleven-year old boy and an older daughter who could
    hear her father crying.  </p>

    minutes and there is no indication that it would have ended – or ended before
    even more harm was done – had the police not arrived on the scene when they
    did.  The appellant was a full
    participant in these criminal activities and may well have been the perpetrator
    who directly threatened the father.</p>

    were significantly more elaborate than that of Mr. Wright) is also a factor for
    consideration.</p>
