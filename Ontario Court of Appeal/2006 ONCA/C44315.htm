style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sole issue on the appeal is at what point in a proceeding against a young
    person under the <i>Youth Criminal Justice Act</i>, S.C. 2002, c.1, (YCJA)
    is a young person who is unable to obtain counsel entitled to publicly funded
    legal aid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>FACTS</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent, Liban S., is a young person who was charged with uttering a threat
    to cause bodily harm.  He was thirteen years old at the time of the alleged
    offence.  He was refused Legal Aid on the basis that his liberty was not
    likely at stake.  At his first appearance in youth court on May 5, 2005,
    the respondent through an agent brought an application for publicly funded
    counsel pursuant to s. 25(4) of the YCJA.  In support of his application,
    the respondent swore an affidavit stating that he had no income of his own;
    that his parents did not own property, were unemployed and had only $8.08
    in the bank; and that he required the services of a lawyer to prepare his
    defence.  The Crown stated that it would be seeking extra judicial sanctions
    (EJS) and a peace bond.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    youth court judge stated that he was not going to issue an order for publicly
    funded legal aid and requested that duty counsel assist the young person.  The
    following exchange took place between duty counsel and the court:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Court: All right.  I’m not going to issue such
    an order.  Mr. McNeil, would you assist this young man.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Duty Counsel: Yes, Your Honour.  I’m sorry did
    Your Honour already make the decision on the 25(4) Application?  Assist him
    in what capacity, Your Honour?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Court: As duty counsel.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Duty Counsel:  Certainly.  The Crown, I believe,
    I just heard is offering EJS, is that correct?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Ms. George [Crown]: He just brought it in.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Court: The consequences are minimal for this
    young man and I do not feel that it is appropriate to issue such an order.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Duty Counsel:  Well, Your Honour, I’ll certainly
    speak to him.  It may be a situation where he’s not going to be able to enter
    into this program, in which case I would certainly ask that the application
    be reviewed.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Court: I am not signing the order. I have made
    my decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>PROCEEDINGS IN THE SUPERIOR
      COURT OF JUSTICE </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    September 19, 2005, the respondent brought a <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> application
    in the Superior Court of Justice for a review of the decision of the youth
    court.  Counsel for the respondent submitted that “[i]n order to take extrajudicial
    sanctions, you have to admit guilt” and in order to make that decision the
    young person would require the assistance of legal counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was no evidence before the motions judge as to whether the young person would
    or would not avail himself of the extrajudicial sanctions as of that date.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her decision granting the respondent’s application, the motions judge made
    the following observations:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In this case the young person was being offered
    the opportunity to have EJS (extra-judicial sanctions) provided that he accepted
    responsibility for the offence.  While the Crown says the young person’s
    right to counsel was not triggered, because he did not indicate whether he
    wished to proceed with the trial, or guilty plea, or avail himself of extra-judicial
    sanctions, in my view the young person need not make such an election before
    being entitled to counsel.  Rather, the very purpose of the right to counsel
    is to allow the young person to retain and instruct counsel without delay,
    and s. 25 says precisely that in sub-section 1 and I quote:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>A young person has the right to retain and
    instruct counsel without delay and to exercise that right personally at any
    stage of the proceedings against the young person, and before and during
    any consideration of whether instead of starting or continuing judicial proceedings
    against the young person under this Act, to use an extra judicial sanction
    to deal with the young person.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Under the <i>Youth Criminal Justice Act</i>, the
    court has no discretion to decline to direct that counsel be provided where
    the young person has been unable to obtain legal aid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motions judge concluded by stating that “the right to counsel is absolute”,
    and allowed the application for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> and
    directed the Youth Court to refer the matter to legal aid for the funding
    of counsel for the young person.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>MOOTNESS</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the outset of the hearing of this appeal, it was brought to the court’s attention
    that the charge against the respondent young person had been disposed of
    and that the appeal is therefore moot.  No objection was taken to the hearing
    of the appeal.  The issue had not been before this court in the context of
    the new YCJA and as the issue would probably occur again, we concluded that
    the public has an interest in having the issue resolved and we therefore
    exercised our discretion to hear the appeal.  <i>Borowski v. Canada (Attorney
    General),</i> [1989] 1 S.C.R. 342; <i>Tremblay v. Daigle,</i> [1989] 2 S.C.R.
    530; <i>Re Cadeddu and The Queen</i> (1983), 4 C.C.C. (3d) 112 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>APPLICABLE STATUTORY
      PROVISIONS</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>25. (1) A young person has the right to retain
    and instruct counsel without delay, and to exercise that right personally,
    at any stage of proceedings against the young person and before and during
    any consideration of whether, instead of starting or continuing judicial
    proceedings against the young person under this Act, to use an extrajudicial

    a young person is not represented by counsel</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)    at a hearing at which it will be determined
    whether to release the young person or detain the young person in custody

    to obtain counsel.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>                   …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4) When a young person at trial or at a hearing
    or review referred to in subsection (3) wishes to obtain counsel but is unable

  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a)<span

    to that program for the appointment of counsel; or</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>if
    no legal aid program or assistance program is available or the young person
    is unable to obtain counsel through the program, may, and on the request
    of the young person shall, direct that the young person be represented by
    counsel.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(5) When a direction is made under paragraph (4)(b)
    in respect of a young person, the Attorney General shall appoint counsel,
    or cause counsel to be appointed, to represent the young person.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is my view that it is clear from a plain reading of sections 25(3) and 25(4)
    that it is only when the youth is at a certain stage of proceedings and unable
    to obtain legal counsel through legal aid that the young person may apply
    for publicly funded counsel.  Parliament has specifically provided that it
    is only when there is a hearing related to the custody of the young person,
    including sentencing or when the young person is engaged in a trial that
    the youth may apply for publicly funded counsel.  While a young person may
    require legal advice at the stage when he or she is considering whether to
    partake in EJS, that advice would be available through duty counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
    in my opinion, this interpretation of the legislation is supported by the
    fact that the reference to s. 25(3) in s. 25(4) would be superfluous if a
    youth court was required to appoint counsel at any stage of the proceedings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the matter before us, the young person had not reached any of the stages
    identified in s. 25(4).  He was at his first court appearance, his custody
    was not in issue and he had yet to decide whether he wished to have a trial.  Accordingly,
    in my view, the youth court judge properly refused to appoint counsel at
    that particular point.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am therefore of the opinion that the motions judge erred in granting the
    young person <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> from the youth court judge’s
    decision.  In coming to her conclusion, the motions judge stated that “once
    satisfied that the young person is legitimately unable to obtain counsel,
    the mandatory provision is triggered”.  It is also instructive to note that
    she only made reference to s. 25(1) of the YCJA without any reference whatsoever
    to s. 25(4).  Subsection 25(1) refers only to a general right to counsel
    whereas the right to publicly funded counsel is addressed in s. 25(4).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    therefore conclude that the decision of the motions judge that is the subject
    matter of this appeal must be set aside.</p>
