    December 15, 2005, reasons reported at [2005] O.J. No. 5670.</span></h4>

lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This appeal raises the primary
    question of the court’s jurisdiction to vest a payor spouse’s private pension
    in a recipient spouse to enforce a support order made under the </span><i><span lang=EN-US>Divorce Act</span></i><span
lang=EN-US>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2<sup>nd</sup> Supp.) (DA). This appeal also
    raises the question of the court’s jurisdiction to order the diversion by
    garnishment of 100 per cent of a payor’s Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age
    Security (OAS) benefits.       </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In this case, the motion judge,
    Fragomeni J., vested 100 per cent of the appellant’s pension in the respondent
    wife, Edwina Trick, and ordered the garnishment of 100 per cent of the
    appellant’s CPP and OAS benefits. These orders, and other relief, were granted
    because the appellant husband, John Trick, was in substantial arrears of child
    and spousal support. The appellant seeks to set aside both orders as well as
    the order made against him to pay $10,000 in costs. The appellant, however,
    does not pursue his appeal of the dismissal of his motion to vary, in which he
    sought to reduce his child support obligations and rescind all support arrears. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, in my
    view, the motion judge erred in granting a vesting order of the appellant’s
    private pension plan because such an order would contravene s. 66(4) of the </span><i><span lang=EN-US>Pension Benefits Act,</span></i><span
lang=EN-US> R.S.O. 1990, c. P.8 (PBA). Section 66(4) permits execution against
    a pension benefit to enforce a support order but to a maximum of 50 per cent of
    the benefit.  Further, the vesting order
    contravened s. 65(1) of the PBA, which voids every transaction purporting,
    among other things, to assign a pension. The order in issue does not fall
    within the exception provided by s. 65(3). The motion judge also erred in
    ordering the diversion or garnishment of more than 50 per cent of the
    appellant’s CPP and OAS benefits. Finally, in the circumstances of this case, I
    would not interfere with the costs order below or award any costs for this
    appeal. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In 1991, the parties entered into a
    separation agreement that provided for both child and spousal support. The
    parties’ 1992 divorce judgment, although silent on the issue of spousal
    support, provided for child support for the parties’ two children. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At the time of separation, the appellant
    was employed by Nortel, earning approximately $120,000 annually. Months later,
    Nortel terminated his employment, thereby triggering payment of the appellant’s
    $31,000 annual Nortel pension. Within four months, the appellant accepted
    employment in Texas at an income much greater than he earned at Nortel. From
    1995 to 2001, the appellant earned an average annual income of $194,258 CAD,
    including his Nortel pension. He did not disclose his increased income to the
    respondent.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the meantime, the respondent’s
    health deteriorated to the point that she was unable to earn any significant
    income. When the respondent eventually learned of the appellant’s actual
    financial circumstances, she sought a retroactive and ongoing variation of
    support. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After an eight-day trial of the
    variation application in 2003, the trial judge, Seppi J., awarded the
    respondent retroactive spousal and child support totaling $225,675 and
    $117,936.41 in costs. She also ordered ongoing monthly spousal support as well
    as child support under the </span><i><span
lang=EN-US>Federal Child Support Guidelines, </span></i><span lang=EN-US>S.O.R./97-175. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Following the variation judgment, the
    appellant appealed to this court. However, his appeal was late and the
    appellant decided not to review the order refusing him an extension of time.
    Instead, he simply reduced his support payments and, according to the
    respondent, “judgment-proofed his U.S. assets.” In Canada, the appellant’s only
    assets are his Nortel pension and his CPP and OAS benefits. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The variation judgment concluded with
    the usual paragraph providing for the enforcement of the support order by the
    Director of the Family Responsibility Office pursuant to the provisions of the </span><i><span lang=EN-US>Family Responsibility and
    Support Arrears Enforcement Act</span></i><span lang=EN-US>, </span><i><span lang=EN-US>1996, </span></i><span
lang=EN-US>S.O. 1996, c. 31 (FRSAEA). On the record before this court, it
    appears that the Director has not withdrawn from enforcement the 2003 support
    variation judgment and the related Support Deduction Order, which was made
    under FRSAEA.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><span
lang=EN-US>The motion below</span></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By March 2005, the appellant owed the
    respondent $422,192.17, including arrears of support, interest and costs. In
    May 2005, the respondent brought a motion for, among other relief, the two
    orders at issue on this appeal: one vesting the appellant’s Nortel pension in
    her name and the other directing the garnishment of 100 per cent of the
    appellant’s CPP and OAS benefits. In response, the appellant brought a
    cross-motion to vary Seppi J.’s judgment to reduce his support obligations.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After reviewing the parties’
    circumstances and the reasons for the 2003 variation, the motion judge
    dismissed the appellant’s motion to vary. He concluded that, in essence, the
    appellant was asking the motion judge to sit on appeal from the earlier
    variation judgment. I agree. In any event, as I have mentioned, the appellant
    does not appeal this part of the motion judge’s order. In argument, the
    appellant advises that he pursues only his challenge of the motion judge’s
    jurisdiction to make the diversion orders.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It is clear from paragraph 35 of the
    motion judge’s reasons that both the vesting order and the garnishment relief
    were granted “to enforce” the support order.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a> In support of his jurisdiction to grant the enforcement relief, the motion
    judge relied on s. 100 of the </span><i><span
lang=EN-US>Courts of Justice Act</span></i><span lang=EN-US>, R.S.O. 1990, c.
    C.43 (CJA), s. 34(1)(c) of the </span><i><span
lang=EN-US>Family Law Act, </span></i><span lang=EN-US>R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3
    (FLA), and those provisions of the DA that permit a court ordering support to
    “impose terms, conditions or restrictions in connection with” a child or
    spousal support order. The motion judge, after commenting on the appellant’s
    extensive history of non-payment and on the appellant’s argument that diversion
    would be inequitable in light of the appellant’s age and financial
    circumstances, concluded that the relief should be granted. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With respect to the 100 per cent
    garnishment of the appellant’s CPP and OAS benefits, the motion judge’s reasons
    were brief: “I am also satisfied that the full amount payable from CPP and OAS

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><span
lang=EN-US>1.     Did the motion judge
    err in vesting 100 per cent of the appellant’s Nortel pension in the

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><i><span lang=EN-US>Summary</span></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant argues that the PBA
    restricts execution against a pension to 50 per cent for spousal support. The
    respondent argues that any such statutory restrictions are not relevant to the
    court’s exercise of its equitable jurisdiction under s. 100 of the CJA, a
    jurisdiction that is akin to the appointment of an equitable receiver under s.
    101 of the CJA.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, s. 100 of the CJA does not
    provide stand-alone jurisdiction to grant the relief claimed. Section 100 only
    provides a mechanism to vest title to a property in respect of which there is a
    separate, valid claim to ownership. Although the motion judge relied on the FLA
    as conferring such a valid claim, the support order was made under the DA and
    not under the FLA. Further, the </span><i><span
lang=EN-US>Family Law Rules, </span></i><span lang=EN-US>O. Reg. 114/99</span><i><span lang=EN-US> </span></i><span
lang=EN-US>(FLR), which provide the procedure for the enforcement of DA support
    orders, do not list vesting orders as an available enforcement mechanism. The
    DA, however, does give a court jurisdiction to secure a spousal support order.
    In that sense, it may be construed as providing the CJA s. 100 authority to
    “encumber” an asset. However, even if that is so at law, the PBA prohibits the
    granting of such a vesting order.  Consequently, in my opinion, even if a vesting order is available in
    equity, that relief should be refused where it would conflict with specific
    provisions of the PBA. This is particularly so because the exigibility of
    pensions is fraught with social and political policy issues, issues that are
    better-suited for the legislature than the courts. Accordingly, I would allow
    the appeal and set aside the vesting order. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>These conclusions follow from a

    66(4).  Execution to satisfy support
    orders is specifically dealt with by s. 66(4) of the Act. If, by virtue of s.
    65(3), a recipient spouse could by court order force the assignment of 100 per
    cent of a payor’s pension, then s. 66(4) would be rendered meaningless. This
    would run afoul of the presumption of coherence in statutory interpretation. In

    contradictory statements within the same statute. See <i>2747-3174 Quebec Inc.

    inconsistent with the legislative history of the provision. In 1988, the

    pension plan”. Such transactions are akin to enforcement under s. 66 of the PBA

    denude s. 66(4) of meaning. I say this because s. 65(3) is necessary to provide
    a mechanism to satisfy a s. 51 equalization of a pension. The legislature
    addresses equalization of pensions in two parts of the PBA. First, the part
    entitled “Benefits” defines what benefits can be equalized and when: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>51 (1) A domestic contract … or an order under Part
    I of [the FLA] is not effective to require payment of a pension benefit [i.e. a

    available to the pensioner].</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> (2) A
    domestic contract or an order mentioned in subsection (1) [i.e. for equalization]

    equalization order can only be made under the FLA and is not available under
    the DA. If the legislature intended an assignment order to be available to
    enforce support orders, it would have included a DA order in addition to a FLA
    order.  However, the legislature chose

lang=EN-US> In </span><i><span lang=EN-US>Beattie</span></i><span
lang=EN-US>, which considered federal legislation, an argument was raised by
    the recipient spouse similar to the one in this case - that the claim was not
    for execution but for an equitable receiver to be appointed to receive and
    apply 100 per cent of the payor’s pension benefits to the outstanding support.
    In setting aside the order appointing the receiver, Justice Rutherford held
    that the equitable relief claimed was beyond the court’s jurisdiction. He came
    to that conclusion based on the particular wording of the federal legislation
    that exempted pensions from execution either “at law or in equity.” He held
    that the relief granted below amounted to indirect attachment or
    extra-legislative garnishment, in the sense that it contemplated the government
    exceeding the garnishment authority conferred by statute. Justice Rutherford
    explained at pp. 231-232:  </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[I]t should be remembered that the courts of equity
    fashioned &quot;equitable&quot; remedies to achieve justice which was
    unat-tainable largely because of the rigidity of legal remedies which were the creatures
    of the courts of law. Here, where Parliament has fashioned statutory remedies
    and placed limitations on those remedies with great specificity, I think it is
    the proper role of the courts to apply and maintain those remedies, including
    their limitations. </p>

    assignment order as part of an equalization order, it had no jurisdiction to
    subsequently enforce an earlier equalization order by appointing the recipient
    spouse as equitable receiver of the payor’s pension payments. Specifically, the
    court concluded, on the basis of similar legislation, that the court below
    erred in ordering equitable receivership where the PBA specifically prohibits
    the diversion of a pension for enforcement purposes. </span></p>

    44, Goudge J.A. commented on the rationale for statutory constraints on
    execution against pensions:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The only exceptions relate to certain orders made
    against the pensioner pursuant to the Family Law Act, namely support orders or
    equalization orders that operate to entitle another to receive the pension
    benefits. With each of these exceptions, there is a cap. The legislative
    objective is to assure that, so far as possible, an employee’s participation in
    a pension plan over the years will make available benefits to provide the sustenance
    he or she needs upon retirement. Even in those exceptional cases where an
    incursion is permitted on that assurance because of the overriding imperatives
    of family law, an upper limit is in place to preserve this objective at least
    to some extent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further, Goudge J.A. distinguished
    between equitable relief employed to overcome unfair common law principles and
    such relief employed to contravene the clear intention of the legislature. He
    observed at para. 51: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The order appointing the respondent as equitable
    receiver is not an example of the court using its equitable jurisdiction to
    circumvent a common law obstacle of its own making. Rather, that order would
    effect a result which, for clear policy reasons, the legislation prohibits,
    namely the enforcing of the equalization order of Fedak J. against the
    appellant’s pension payments. In my view, however strong the equities might
    otherwise be, it is not just or convenient in these circumstances to appoint an
    equitable receiver to achieve a result which is in direct conflict with the
    applicable legislation. In this I agree with Rutherford J. in <i>Beattie v.
    Ladouceur</i> (1995), 23 O.R. (3d) 225 (Gen. Div.), who came to the same
    conclusion in the context of similar federal legislation. </p>

lang=EN-US>and </span><i><span lang=EN-US>Hooper </span></i><span lang=EN-US>apply to the support issue in this case. Subsection
    66(4) of the PBA clearly restricts execution to enforce a support order to 50
    per cent of the </span>payor’s<span
lang=EN-US> pension. Had the legislature intended to grant the court
    jurisdiction to increase that exemption, it would have so provided, as it has

    should not be employed in this case. This is not a situation of invoking equity
    to overcome limitations in the common law system of enforcement. In this case
    there is no common law impediment to preclude garnishment. The impediment is a
    specific statutory one, crafted by the legislature, which was alive to and
    balanced the competing policies of pension preservation and the enforcement of
    support obligations in the family law context. In those circumstances, it
    cannot be either just or convenient to allow the result sought by the

    this case comes within the FOAEAA definition of a “support order” as one  “enforceable in any province”. This is so

    appellant’s CPP and OAS benefits are “garnishable moneys” subject to
    garnishment in accordance with the other provisions of the FOAEAA. By definition,
    “garnishable moneys” are moneys authorized to be paid by federal statute or

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On the third issue, I see no conflict
    between the FOAEAA and Ontario’s garnishment law, which I will review, such as
    to attract the override provision of FOAEAA’s s. 26. First, I cannot accept the
    respondent’s argument that the “all” in “all garnishable moneys” reflects a
    parliamentary intention to render all payments garnishable at 100 per cent
    under s. 24. If Parliament had intended this result, it would have said so
    clearly. </span></p>

    relied upon by the appellant provides for 100 per cent garnishment for support,
    but it applies only against pension benefits payable under “Acts and like
    enactments referred to in the schedule.” Since neither the CPP nor the OAS

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>“Provincial garnishment law” is
    defined in s. 23(1) of the FOAEAA as “the law of a province relating to
    garnishment as it applies to the enforcement of support orders and support
    provisions”. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The FLR do not specify a quantum of
    garnishment with respect to pensions or benefits. In any event, because the FLR
    are procedural in nature, as I have emphasized, they cannot constitute
    “provincial garnishment law” since they do not confer substantive jurisdiction. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>One statute in Ontario, however,
    specifically defines itself as a “provincial garnishment law” for the purposes
    of support enforcement: the FRSAEA. Section 20(5) of that Act provides that a
    support deduction order “shall be deemed to be a notice of garnishment made
    under provincial garnishment law for the purposes of the </span><i><span lang=EN-US>Family Orders and
    Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act </span></i><span lang=EN-US>(Canada)”.
    Section 23(1) of the FRSAEA caps garnishment at 50 per cent of the payor’s
    “income source”, which is defined in s. 1 as including a “disability,
    retirement or other pension”. In </span><i><span
lang=EN-US>Ontario (Director, Family Responsibility Office) v. Johnson, </span></i><span
lang=EN-US>[2003] O.J. No. 2318 (O.C.J.),</span><i><span lang=EN-US> </span></i><span lang=EN-US>the Director took the
    position that only 50 per cent of CPP and OAS benefits are garnishable.</span><a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt'>[16]</span></span></a><span
lang=EN-US> I conclude that s. 23(1) of the FRSAEA restricts the Director’s
    garnishment to 50 per cent of the appellant’s CPP or OAS benefits. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As I noted earlier in these reasons,
    the record before this court indicates that the support order and the Support
    Deduction Order in this case remain filed with the Director. In this
    circumstance, by ss. 6(7), 6(8), and 9(1) of the FRSAEA, support enforcement
    rests exclusively with the Director and, in the result, garnishment is capped
    at 50 per cent. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, in my view, even if the
    respondent is seeking garnishment on her own behalf, garnishment must still be
    capped at 50 per cent. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The principle behind s. 66(4) of the
    PBA, which is the only other provincial statute that addresses garnishment for
    the enforcement of support, lends support to this conclusion. I refer to the
    principle behind s. 66(4) because, arguably, s. 66(4) has no direct application
    to the benefits at issue in this appeal. This is so because the PBA applies
    only to private pension plans that are organized and administered to provide
    pensions for employees, whereas the CPP and OAS benefits are provided by the
    government. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However,
      it is unnecessary to consider this argument because, even if the PBA’s
      s. 66(4) does not apply, I am of the view that a court should exercise
      its discretion to limit garnishment to 50 per cent of CPP and OAS benefits.
      Such a discretion is provided by r. 29(19) of the FLR, which permits a
      court at a garnishment hearing to change “how much is
    being garnished” on account of either a periodic or non-periodic payment
    order. That discretion, in my view, should be exercised in a manner consistent
    with the FRSAEA, the FOAEAA and s. 66(4) of the PBA to restrict individual
    garnishment to 50 per cent, the same restriction as is placed on garnishment
    by the Director. It is a matter of common sense that the Director and the
    individual payee should have the same remedies available to enforce support
    orders.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, I conclude that
    garnishment of CPP and OAS benefits ought to be restricted to 50 per cent and
    that the motion judge erred in garnisheeing 100 per cent of these benefits. I
    would set aside the order of the motion judge to the extent that it provides
    for 100 per cent garnishment. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>3. Did the motion judge err in

    order below. In my view, the motion judge did not err in the exercise of his
    discretion regarding costs for two reasons. First, the respondent was entirely
    successful in defending against the appellant’s application to vary support and
    to rescind all arrears. Second, the respondent remains entitled to orders for
    garnishment of 50 per cent of the Nortel pension and the CPP and OAS benefits.
    In this sense, the respondent was successful below and is entitled to her
    costs.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Given the particular circumstances of

    would allow the appeal. I would set aside the order below with the exceptions

    relating to the dismissal of the appellant’s cross-motion to vary his child
    support obligations and to rescind his spousal support arrears, and paragraph 5
    relating to beneficiary designation.  Though the appellant seeks to “[set] aside the order made by Justice
    Fragomeni on September 14, 2005 in its entirety,” as mentioned previously, the
    appellant did not appeal from the dismissal of his motion to vary.  Further, neither party addressed whether the
    motion judge erred in designating the respondent as the sole beneficiary of the
    appellant’s pension plans in Canada.   Absent submissions made by counsel on this issue, I would decline to set
    aside this portion of the order.</span></p>
