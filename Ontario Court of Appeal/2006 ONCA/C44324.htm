style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    the consent of the parties, the complainant, nine years old at the time of
    trial, testified under oath.  She testified that the appellant, her great
    uncle, touched her genital area, both under and over her clothes on as many
    as thirty occasions while her family was visiting the appellant’s residence.  She
    was seven years old when the abuse began, and she was eight years old at
    the time of the last incident of sexual touching.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant first disclosed her allegations to her cousin, D.  After telling
    D. the details, D. told her that the appellant was “child abusing” her and
    told the complainant to tell her mother.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    month or two later, the complainant was reading a book with her mother.  According
    to the complainant, her mother read a word at the end of a chapter that was
    like old English.  This word sounded like “child abuse” to her.  She then
    asked her mother what child abuse was and told her mother that she thought
    she had “been child abused”.  Her mother explained what child abuse was and
    the complainant confirmed that she had indeed been abused by the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    mother’s description of the disclosure was slightly different.  Her recollection
    was that a character in the book tells his uncle that if he hits him, it
    would be considered child abuse.  The complainant, upon hearing this, asked
    her mother what child abuse was.  The mother’s response prompted the complainant
    to say that she “thought that she had had child abuse done to her”
    by the appellant.  The mother was in contact with the Children’s Aid Society
    almost immediately. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s wife, Mrs. C., also testified.  On the day the appellant was
    arrested, he told her that he “didn’t do this”.  When the appellant later
    called her from the police station to try to tell her that he was innocent,
    Mrs. C. did not want to hear it, having already decided for herself that
    the appellant was guilty.  When Mrs. C. brought the appellant some of his
    belongings, she confronted him with the complainant’s allegations.  Mrs.
    C. testified that after hearing the details of the allegations, the appellant
    responded “I don’t remember, I can’t remember” and then put his head down
    on the steering wheel.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mrs.
    C. first made mention of this utterance to the Crown attorney a few days
    before trial on May 25, 2005, when she called to tell him about a letter
    the appellant had written to her.  She had not mentioned this utterance either
    in her May 26, 2004 written statement to the police or in her testimony given
    at the preliminary hearing on January 4, 2005.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='

    defence attacked the complainant’s credibility in cross-examination by highlighting
    the inconsistencies in her evidence with respect to the number times the
    sexual touching allegedly occurred, the parties present when it happened,
    and the room in which the events took place.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:
normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    having made the statement attributed to him by Mrs. C.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:
normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    Crown and defence witnesses.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge provided short but thorough reasons noting, at the outset, that
    he should not simply choose between competing versions of the story.  He
    correctly recognized that the burden of proof was on the Crown and articulated
    and applied the principles set out in <i>R. v. W.(D</i>.<i>)</i> (1991),
    63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.).  The trial judge concluded that the appellant’s
    denial of the abuse was incapable of belief and that his version of events
    was a lie.  On the evidence he did accept, the trial judge was convinced
    of the appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and he convicted the appellant
    accordingly.</p>

line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></u></h4>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US>(a)       Did the trial
      judge feel compelled to decide which of the complainant or the appellant
      was telling the truth?</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='

normal'><span lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant argues that the trial judge improperly considered the complainant’s
      truthfulness as a first step before considering the appellant’s credibility.  The
      trial judge then approached the case as one of choosing between two competing
      versions of what happened.  This, he argues, is apparent from the portion
      of the reasons where the trial judge stated: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>[Y]ou haven’t made my job any easier but I get paid to make the call.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US>Counsel
      have heard me say before that sometimes we’re not just in the best place
      in this criminal law business that we’re all in, to sort these things out.  But
      it seems to be the only place there is.  So we have to do the best we can.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>So just listening to the two of them, it would be difficult for me
      to be able to give a reason for a decision.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although
      portions of the trial judge’s decisions, such as the one quoted above,
      are at times discursive, it is not appropriate to take small portions of
      the reasons and look at them in isolation.  When the trial judge’s reasons
      are considered as a whole, it is clear that the trial judge properly recognized
      that the trial was not a credibility contest.  He charged himself on the <i>W.(D.)</i> principles
      and considered the whole of the trial evidence before making the findings
      required to convict or acquit the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With
      respect to the order in which the trial judge assessed the credibility
      of the complainant and the appellant, the cases of <i>R. v. Richardson</i> (1992),
      74 C.C.C. (3d) 15 (Ont. C.A.) and <i>R. v. Maharaj</i> (2004), 186 C.C.C.
      (3d) 247 (Ont. C.A.) do not, as suggested by the appellant, stand for the
      proposition that where the accused testifies his credibility has to be
      assessed first.  At para. 33 of <i>R. v. Maharaj</i>, this court confirmed
      that <i>W.(D.)</i> need not be applied “in the order prescribed by Cory
      J.”.  These two cases simply state that trial judges ought not to merely
      choose between the evidence of the complainant and the accused and have
      a duty to give reasoned reasons for their decisions.  See also <i>R. v.
      Boucher</i> (2005), 202 C.C.C. (3d) 34 (S.C.C.) at para. 29.  We reject
      this ground of appeal.</span></p>
  <h3 align=left style='
text-align:left;'><span lang=EN-US>(b)       Did the trial judge consider the

line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant argues that the trial judge used the complainant’s original complaint
      to her mother for its truth and, therefore, as being confirmatory of the
      abuse having occurred.  The appellant maintains that the original complaint
      ought not to have been admitted, as it did not come within any of the recognized
      exceptions and had no probative value.</span></p>

      my view, the original complaint to the complainant’s mother was properly
      admitted and falls squarely within the narrative exception to the general
      rule against self-serving evidence.  I add that no objection was taken
      to the evidence at trial and given the general nature of the complaint
      made to the mother the potential for it being used for the prohibited purpose
      of oath helping was limited.  </span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>Narrative is justified as providing background to the story – to provide
      chronological cohesion and eliminate gaps which would divert the mind of
      the listener from the central issue.  It may be supportive of the central
      allegation in the sense of creating a logical framework for its presentation –
    but it cannot be used, and the jury must be warned of this, as confirmation
    of the truthfulness of the sworn allegation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;

      properly admitted at trial, the evidence of prior complaint cannot be used
      as a form of self-corroboration to prove that the incident in fact occurred.  It
      cannot be used as evidence of the truth of its contents.  However, the
      evidence can “be supportive of the central allegation in the sense of creating
      a logical framework for its presentation”, as set out above, and can be
      used in assessing the truthfulness of the complainant.  As set out in <i>R.
      v. F. (J.E.)</i> at p. 476: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>The fact that the statements were made is admissible to assist the

      truthfulness.  However, the jury must be instructed that they are not to
      look to the content of the statements as proof that a crime has been committed.</span></p>

      story – how they were reading this book, and how the thing came up about
      child sexual abuse.</span></p>

      the difficulty in the victim providing a full account of events.  In appropriate

      the logical cogency of the child’s evidence, be a useful tool in assisting
      the trial judge in the assessment of the child’s truthfulness.  This was
      such a case.  I would, therefore, give no effect to this ground of appeal.</span></p>

      appellant submits that the trial judge found nothing in the manner of the
      appellant’s testimony to undermine his credibility.  He then set about
      to find a basis for rejecting that testimony.  He seized upon Mrs. C.’s
      testimony that the appellant had said “I don’t remember” in response to
      being confronted with the allegations of abuse and used the appellant’s
      denial of having made this statement as undermining his entire testimony.  By

      Mrs. C.’s evidence and her explanation as to why she had neither made reference
      to this statement to police nor mentioned it in her evidence at the preliminary
      hearing.  The trial judge accepted her explanation and used the conflict

      appellant refers to extracts from the trial judge’s reasons wherein the
      trial judge says that the complainant “seemed to be telling me the truth”.  He
      submits that these indicate that the trial judge applied a lower standard
      to the evidence of the complainant and Mrs. C. than to the evidence of
      the appellant.  The appellant listed a number of inconsistencies in the
      complainant’s testimony and suggested that the trial judge improperly relied
      on the absence of motive to fabricate as a basis for accepting the evidence
      of the complainant and Mrs. C. </span></p>

line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There
      is no evidence that the trial judge applied the wrong legal standard or
      that he approached the assessment of credibility of Crown and defence witnesses
      differently.  The trial judge was alive to the inconsistencies in the complainant’s
      evidence and assessed her evidence as a whole.  He found her to be credible.  The
      trial judge properly addressed motive to fabricate, as the appellant had
      suggested that Mrs. C. did have such a motive.  The trial judge considered
      the absence of any motive to fabricate as one feature of the evidence,
      but the reasons do not suggest that the trial judge placed any onus on
      the appellant to prove a motive to fabricate.  Absence of any motive to
      fabricate an allegation is a proper matter for consideration in the course
      of the fact-finding process: see <i>R. v. Jackson</i> (1995), 28 W.C.B.
      (2d) 179 at para. 5 (Ont. C.A.).</span></p>

      the length of the trial, the trial judge gave adequate reasons, supported
      by evidence, as to why he disbelieved the appellant’s evidence and why
      that evidence did not leave him with a reasonable doubt.  He also assessed
      the Crown’s evidence and determined that the offences had been made out
      beyond a reasonable doubt.  The trial judge demonstrated a good grasp of
      the evidence as well as the issues and his findings of credibility were
      based on an assessment of the evidence as a whole.</span></p>
