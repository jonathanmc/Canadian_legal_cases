  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Just after midnight on December 25, 2001, Woodbine Building
    Supply was totally destroyed in a massive fire that had been intentionally
    set.  It was located on Danforth Avenue
    in a residential neighbourhood of Toronto; some of the nearby homes were only 100
    to 150 feet away from the business.  One
    hundred and twenty firefighters were deployed to extinguish the fire and
    prevent its spread.  The fire crews
    evacuated local residents and were able to prevent the fire from spreading to
    the neighbourhood.  Debris from the
    explosion sprayed across Danforth Avenue and became embedded in cars parked
    across the street.  On January 9, 2002,
    during excavation of the basement of the premises, demolition workers
    discovered the severely burned body of Tomislav Jarcevic.  After the fire, the appellant Magno and his
    brother made an insurance claim for $3.5 million -- $2 million for the building
    and $1.5 million for the contents and inventory.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was the Crown’s theory that Magno, an owner of the business
    and premises, planned to burn the property so that he could obtain the
    insurance proceeds and that he had recruited the appellant McMaster, John
    Paskalis and Jarcevic to assist him.  Magno was at home during the fire but the other three were on the scene.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants were charged with, among other things, second
    degree murder under s. 229(c) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  That provision reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>229. Culpable homicide is murder</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(c) where a person, for an unlawful object,
    does anything that he knows (or ought to know)<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a> is likely to cause death, and thereby causes death to a human being
    notwithstanding that he desires to effect his object without causing death or
    bodily harm to any human being.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After a lengthy preliminary inquiry before Marin J., the
    appellants were discharged on the second degree murder charges.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The preliminary inquiry judge referred extensively to this
    court’s decision in <i>R. v. Meiler</i> (1999), 136 C.C.C. (3d) 11.  In <i>Meiler </i>at para. 41,<i> </i>this
    court states that the <i>actus reus</i> requirement of the offence under s.
    229(c) is that the offender does anything thereby causing the death of a human
    being.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The preliminary inquiry judge held that this requirement was
    met, stating at para. 121 of the reasons that there was “ample” evidence that
    the appellants’ participation in the arson was a significant contributing cause
    of Jarcevic’s death.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In paras. 48 - 49 and 53 - 54 of <i>Meiler</i>, this court
    identified two elements of the <i>mens rea </i>requirement.  First, the acts of the accused that caused
    the death must have been done for the purpose of “an unlawful object”, that is,
    to bring about some unlawful object other than the injury that causes
    death.  Second, the accused must know
    that the act or acts that are done for the purpose of the unlawful object are
    likely to cause death, notwithstanding the wish to effect the object without
    causing death or bodily harm to any human being.  It is the latter element that creates a requirement for the
    subjective foresight of death by the accused.  As this court explained at para. 58, the accused need not foresee the
    precise situation or all of the events that result in the death.  It is sufficient if the accused has the
    subjective foresight that the acts done for the unlawful object are likely to
    cause death and those acts are sufficiently linked to the death to have caused
    the death within the meaning of the section.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The preliminary inquiry judge concluded that the first element
    of the <i>mens rea </i>requirement was met in that there was evidence of an
    unlawful object in addition to the dangerous act causing death, whether that
    unlawful object is determined to be arson or conspiracy to commit arson for a
    fraudulent purpose.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She also found evidence of conduct that a reasonable person
    would know was likely to cause death.  At para. 110 of her reasons, the preliminary inquiry judge stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is no longer constitutionally permissible to
    prove that the accused ought to have known that their conduct was likely to
    cause death.  This case would be simple
    if the objective standard was still in effect, as in my view, there is evidence
    which, if believed, could support a jury’s finding that each accused ought to
    have known of the <u>likelihood of death </u>in carrying out the conspiracy to
    commit arson.  However, that is not the
    test.  [footnotes omitted, emphasis
    added]   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The preliminary inquiry judge noted that the cumulative
    evidence showed that the appellants were aware of the dangerous nature of their
    actions.  However, she held that the
    precautions taken by the appellants to avoid the consequence of serious bodily
    harm or death “belie subjective foresight of the likelihood of death”.  She concluded that the lack of congruence
    between the unlawful object of the conspiracy to commit arson for fraud and the
    dangerous act of arson and its consequence of Jarcevic’s death did not support
    the reasonable inference that the appellants had the requisite subjective
    foresight necessary for murder.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants were committed to stand trial on manslaughter
    and a number of other charges.<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown brought an application for <i>certiorari</i> to
    review the discharge on murder.  There
    was but one issue before the reviewing judge:  whether the preliminary inquiry judge committed a jurisdictional error
    in relation to the subjective foresight element of the <i>mens rea</i> requirement.       </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice Caputo quashed the discharge after concluding that the
    preliminary inquiry justice had, in bridging the gap from objective
    foreseeability to subjective foreseeability, weighed competing inferences and
    chosen the inference favourable to the accused.       </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The primary issue before this court is whether the reviewing
    judge correctly concluded that the preliminary inquiry judge committed
    jurisdictional error.  McMaster raises
    an additional issue: whether the reviewing judge erred in hearing the <i>certiorari</i> application without the transcripts of the evidence adduced at the preliminary
    inquiry.  The court did not call on the
    Crown to respond to this additional issue.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE JURISDICTIONAL ISSUE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reviewing judge correctly articulated the legal principles
    that governed the <i>certiorari</i> application.  Those principles can be summarised as follows.  The purpose of a preliminary inquiry is to
    ensure that there is sufficient evidence to commit an accused to trial.  If there is evidence upon which a reasonable
    and properly instructed jury could convict, the preliminary inquiry justice
    must commit the accused.  Section
    548(1)(b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> requires a preliminary inquiry judge to
    consider the whole of the evidence adduced during the preliminary inquiry
    before there may be a discharge.  The judge
    may not discharge the accused unless, on the whole of the evidence, no
    sufficient case is made out.  While the
    sufficiency test is the same whether the evidence is direct or circumstantial,
    the nature of the judge’s task varies.  In cases where there is direct evidence on each of the elements of the
    offence, the accused must be committed for trial.  Where, as in this case, the evidence is circumstantial, the judge
    must engage in a “limited weighing of the evidence” in order to determine
    whether the elements of the offence “may reasonably be inferred from the
    circumstantial evidence”.  See <i>R. v.
    Arcuri, </i>(2001), 157 C.C.C. (3d) 21 (S.C.C.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In para. 29 of his reasons, relying on <i>R. v. Sazant</i>,
    [2004] 3&nbsp;S.C.R. 635, the reviewing judge correctly states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is a jurisdictional error and subject to review
    for a Justice presiding over a preliminary inquiry to discharge where there are
    competing inferences in the evidence and one of those inferences supports the
    charge before the court.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reviewing judge concluded that the preliminary inquiry
    judge resolved the issue of subjective foresight by weighing competing
    inferences to determine that there was no evidence that the accused knew that
    their acts were likely to cause death.  He reasoned that once the preliminary inquiry judge found that there was
    objective foreseeability, she must have accepted the inference that the
    appellants did not intend the natural consequences of their actions.  That is because, having found that a
    reasonable person ought to have foreseen the likelihood of death, absent
    evidence that the accused were not reasonable persons, one permissible
    inference is that these appellants, as reasonable persons, intended the natural
    consequences of their actions and therefore had the requisite <i>mens rea</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with that result.  The Crown is often required to prove a culpable state of mind as an
    element of an offence.  The culpable
    state of mind may be intention, foresight or something else, such as
    knowledge.  Section 229(c) requires
    proof of foresight, that is, that an accused foresaw that the acts done for the
    unlawful object were likely to cause death.  The inquiry is ultimately a subjective one.  That does not mean, however, that a consideration of what the
    normal or reasonable person would have intended or foreseen is unhelpful or
    irrelevant.  A person’s state of mind
    may be determined by what a person says and does.  It may be deduced also by considering what the natural
    consequences of someone’s actions are and whether the person, by acting in the
    manner for which there would be natural consequences, foresaw that those
    natural consequences would occur.  While
    there is no legal presumption that a person foresees or intends the natural
    consequences of his or her acts, it is a common sense proposition.  As Roach J.A. wrote, citing Lord Denning, in <i>R. v. Giannotti</i> (1956), 115 C.C.C. 203 at 213 (Ont. C.A.):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The presumption of intention is not a proposition
    of law but a proposition of ordinary good sense. It means this: that, as a man
    is usually able to foresee what are the natural consequences of his acts, so it
    is, as a rule, reasonable to infer that he did foresee them and intend
    them.  But, while that is an inference
    which may be drawn, it is not one which must be drawn.  If on all the facts of the case it is not
    the correct inference, then it should not be drawn.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The preliminary inquiry judge properly pointed out that the
    appellants could not be convicted on the basis that death was objectively
    foreseeable as a likely result of their actions.  However, she appears to have concluded that as the offence could
    not be proven on that basis, she could not consider objective foresight at
    all.  In my view, that led her to
    jurisdictional error.  The fact that a
    reasonable person would have foreseen the likelihood of death makes available
    the inference that the appellants, as reasonable persons, would have foreseen
    the likelihood of death.  By failing to
    consider the possibility that this inference was available, the preliminary
    inquiry judge failed to consider the inference favourable to the Crown and
    considered only the inference that favoured the appellants.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The preliminary
    inquiry judge fortified her conclusion that the appellants had no subjective
    foresight of the likelihood of death in a number of ways.  In my view, the reviewing judge correctly
    found that each of these represented the preliminary inquiry judge preferring
    one inference over another available one.  For instance, the preliminary inquiry judge held that it would have been
    “unreasonable” for the appellants to continue with their plan had they known
    that it was likely to cause death.  However, as the reviewing judge points out, it was open also to a trier
    of fact to infer that the appellants took a chance and committed the offences,
    knowing that death was likely, because they were prepared to take the
    risk.  The absence of congruence between
    the arson or conspiracy and the likely consequence of death cannot preclude the
    availability of the inference that the consequence was foreseen.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, the preliminary inquiry judge held that it would
    have been contrary to common sense and to the appellants’ purpose and motive to
    continue had they foreseen death.  Again, I agree with the reviewing justice that the precautions that the
    appellants took may lead to an inference that the appellants, while not
    intending death, were aware that it was likely to flow from their actions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would dismiss this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE TRANSCRIPTS ISSUE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>McMaster would not agree to a statement of facts for
    the purposes of rule 6.13 of the Ontario Court of Justice Criminal Proceedings
    Rules, which permits a judge to dispense with the filing of a transcript with
    the agreement of the Crown and the accused.  Before the reviewing judge, the Crown and Magno took the position that
    it was appropriate for him to proceed on the basis of the facts as described by
    the preliminary inquiry judge in her reasons.  McMaster objected.  The reviewing
    judge proceeded to hear the application without the transcripts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The reviewing judge relied on rule 2.02 to dispense
    with the necessity of filing the entire transcript on the <i>certiorari</i> application.  Rule 2.02 permits the
    court, “where and as necessary in the interests of justice”, to dispense with
    compliance with any rule at any time.  He noted that no party alleged that the preliminary inquiry judge failed
    to consider the whole of the evidence presented by the Crown; no party alleged
    any factual error in the reasons given by the preliminary inquiry judge; the
    facts relied on by the parties were not in dispute; and, the only issue to be
    decided was a legal one.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>McMaster
    relies on <i>R. v. Boylan </i>(1979), 46 C.C.C. (2nd) 415 (Sask. C.A.) as
    support for this ground of appeal.  However, that case is readily distinguishable from the instant
    case.  In <i>Boylan</i>, there was a
    malfunction in the recording apparatus at the accused’s preliminary inquiry
    that made it impossible for the evidence to be transcribed.  Following his committal for trial, the
    accused’s application for <i>certiorari </i>was ultimately successful because
    the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal held that a proper recording is required by
    the <i>Criminal Code </i>for the protection of the accused.  In the present case, the evidence had been
    recorded so there was no breach of the <i>Code</i>.  The only question is whether the reviewing judge was entitled, in
    the circumstances, to proceed without a transcript of the evidence.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>McMaster has advanced no argument as to how the
    availability of the transcript might have had an effect on the reviewing judge’s
    decision.  He makes no claim of
    prejudice due to the absence of transcripts.  He does not suggest that the proceedings or result might have been
    different had the reviewing judge had the transcripts.  Nor does he make any complaint about the
    reviewing judge’s understanding or articulation of the facts – no doubt because
    he explicitly accepts the facts relied on by the reviewing judge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the circumstances, I see no possibility of error
    arising from the absence of transcripts.  The thorough, careful reasons of the preliminary inquiry judge provided
    the necessary factual basis on which the reviewing judge could decide the legal
    issue before him.  I see no basis for
    interfering with the exercise of the reviewing judge’s discretion and,
    consequently, would dismiss this ground of appeal.</p>
