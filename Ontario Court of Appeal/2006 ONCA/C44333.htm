    Resource Gas Limited (“NRG”) appeals from a decision of the Divisional Court
    dated April 21, 2005, dismissing its appeal of the Review Decision of the
    Ontario Energy Board (the “OEB”) dated April 19, 2004. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>NRG
    purchases gas from producers and distributes it to its customers at rates
    regulated by the OEB.  Because of an accounting error, NRG had unrecorded
    costs of purchasing gas in the amount of $531,794 during the period from
    October 1, 2002 to December 31, 2003.  Had these costs been recognized, they
    would have been passed on to NRG’s customers in the normal course.  After
    an initial unsuccessful application, NRG made a second application to the
    OEB on January 20, 2004 in which it sought authorization to record the unrecorded
    costs as a debit as of January 1, 2004 and an order allowing the recovery
    of the unrecorded costs by increasing its rates over a twelve month period
    commencing May 1, 2004.  The OEB’s Review Decision on that application is
    the subject of this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    that decision, the OEB found the unrecorded costs were material and had been
    prudently incurred and therefore NRG should be permitted to recover them.  The
    OEB also decided that NRG’s recovery of the costs would be deferred over
    three years to minimize rate volatility to customers.  Then, in what gives
    rise to this appeal, the OEB went on to decide that NRG would not be allowed
    to recover any of its regulatory costs or the interest charges associated
    with the deferral of the recovery of the unrecorded costs.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>NRG
    contends that the interest and regulatory expenses result not from the accounting
    error but from the OEB’s decision to defer recovery the unrecorded costs.  NRG
    submits that since the OEB decided that the unrecorded costs were prudently
    incurred, it follows that the expenses that are associated with the OEB’s
    decision to defer recovery are also prudently incurred.  NRG asserts that
    as a matter of law it would not be “just and reasonable” to deny their recovery.</p>

    would dismiss the appeal because the OEB's decision satisfies the applicable
    standard of review:  reasonableness.</p>

    erred and that the proper standard of review of the OEB’s decision in this
    case is correctness.</p>

    while the result did not turn on the standard of review, Doherty J.A. did
    note (at para. 17) that the OEB had advanced a “forceful argument that the
    standard of review should, at the highest, be one of reasonableness”.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span

    a dispute as to whether the parties had agreed that Toronto Hydro would install
    an electricity distribution system in a Graywood building project before
    November 1, 2000.  This case concerns whether the OEB’s decision to deny
    recovery of certain regulatory and interest expenses is “just and reasonable”.  I
    am satisfied the nature of these questions is sufficiently different that
    it is necessary to address the standard of review that applies in this case
    afresh.  That <i>Graywood</i> was not available to the parties when this
    case was argued provides additional reason to do so.  </p>

lang=EN-US>The question before the Board was therefore not simply whether recovery
      of costs prudently incurred should be allowed, as the appellant characterized
      it. The matter was compounded by the added issue of how to deal with the
      accumulation of costs caused by the appellant’s inadvertence. The Board
      determined that customers must pay the prudently incurred unrecorded costs
      of the appellant, but the impact of recovery of the accumulated total should
      be ameliorated by allowing recovery over three years. The accumulated cost
      of the time over which recovery from customers would be required and the
      appellant’s regulatory costs … must be borne by the appellant. That issue
      was not a question of law but one involving fact-finding, policy considerations,
      rate-setting expertise, and law.</span></p>

    relies on the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in <i>TransCanada Pipelines
    Limited v. National Energy Board</i>, [2004] F.C.J. No. 654 (C.A.). Under
    its governing legislation, the National Energy Board’s authority to determine
    just and reasonable tolls, like that of the OEB, is not limited by any statutory
    directions.  Rothstein J.A. indicated that the impact on customers or consumers
    could not be a factor in the determination of the utility’s cost of equity
    capital.  However, any resulting increase could be so significant that it
    would be proper for the Board to phase in the tolls over time provided there
    was no economic loss to the utility.  He said (at para. 43), “In other words,
    the phased in tolls would have to compensate the utility for deferring recovery
    of its cost of capital.”</p>

    do not read the OEB's decision to be inconsistent with the proposition that
    a utility must be allowed to recover all of its prudently incurred costs.  The
    OEB, upon concluding that the unrecorded gas costs had been prudently incurred,
    allowed NRG to recover them.  However, the OEB did not accept the premise
    of NRG’s position on this appeal — that if the unrecorded gas costs were
    prudently incurred, it must logically follow that the regulatory costs to
    recover them and the interest costs associated with the deferral of their
    recovery were also prudently incurred.  Rather, the OEB found the accumulation
    of these costs was attributable to NRG’s failures to properly record them
    and to discover its error promptly:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>We are surprised
    and disappointed with the time that it took NRG to realize that its PGCVA
    mechanism was incorrect, which exposed the utility and its customers to unnecessary
    risk and created a difficult situation for the customers and the Board. However,
    we accept that the misrecording was the result of error, not a purposeful
    action by NRG.</p>

    OEB went on to observe:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>Had NRG recorded the gas cost variances properly in the PGCVA,
    the present conundrum would have been avoided.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>... we find
    the NRG’s error has resulted in a substantial and avoidable accumulation

      factual findings of the OEB are not open to question on appeal.  In light
      of these findings, the OEB said,
    “[W]e must therefore look for a balance”.  The OEB struck that balance in
    the following terms:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Considering
    the need for NRG to recover its prudently incurred unrecorded gas costs and
    mitigating the impact on customers, as well as not creating undue inter-generational

    over a three year period, in equal portions, without interest.</p>

    my reading, the OEB took the view that NRG’s regulatory costs were not prudently
    incurred.  That view is reasonable.  But for NRG’s accounting error and the
    delay in recognizing it, NRG would not have had to incur costs to seek and
    obtain the OEB’s decision to permit recovery of the unrecorded costs.   </p>

    emphasizes that it did not seek recovery of any interest charges from the
    time the costs were not recorded to the date of the OEB’s decision finding
    the costs to have been prudently incurred.  Therefore it submits that the
    interest charges it claims are the direct result of the OEB’s decision to
    rate-smooth and not of NRG’s accounting error.  </p>

    my view, it was open to the OEB to consider the underlying as well as the
    direct cause of the interest charges.  The OEB said, “It is also our view
    that customers should not be burdened by any interest charges that would
    not have accrued had the customers been presented with the appropriate timely
    billing”.  While the interest charges directly result from the OEB’s decision
    to defer their recovery, the OEB would not have faced the situation that
    prompted that decision “had NRG recorded the gas costs variances properly”
    and there had been no “substantial and avoidable accumulation of potential
    customers’ charges”.  Rather, the “present conundrum could have been avoided”.  </p>
