style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is an appeal from the order of the motions judge declaring that the action
    between the appellants and the respondent had been settled on the terms set
    out in an alleged settlement agreement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Zhuppas are Albanian refugees who sought asylum in Canada in December&nbsp;1997.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    action which forms the basis of the disputed settlement agreement arose out
    of a motor vehicle accident that occurred on November 23, 2000, in which
    the appellant Kristo Zhuppa was injured and his wife Mrs. Zhuppa advanced
    a claim under s. 61 of the <i>Family Law Act</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the autumn of 2003, the Zhuppas retained Mr. Harvey Lewin as their solicitor.  Mr.
    Lewin asked Mr. Zhuppa to attend a meeting at Mr. Lewin’s office on April
    14, 2005.  Both Mr. and Mrs. Zhuppa have a limited ability to communicate
    verbally in English and neither is capable of reading or writing in English.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    the assistance of his seventeen-year-old son Pirro (whose first language
    is Greek), Mr. Zhuppa informed Mr. Lewin that he wished to have a professional
    interpreter with him that day, but Mr.&nbsp;Lewin told Pirro that his assistance
    would be sufficient.  Mrs.&nbsp;Zhuppa was not asked to attend. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Zhuppa and Pirro attended at Mr. Lewin’s office.  Also present were Ms.&nbsp;Pamela
    Blaikie on behalf of the respondent, a representative from the respondent’s
    insurance company and representatives of Mr. Zhuppa’s accident benefits insurer.  During
    the settlement meeting, the respondent submits that a settlement was ultimately
    reached.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that Pirro told Mr. Lewin that although Mr. Zhuppa signed
    a release, he was to retain the release until Mr. Zhuppa consulted Mrs. Zhuppa.  The
    evidence is that Pirro now believes he may not have adequately conveyed his
    father’s instructions to Mr.&nbsp;Lewin.  The release contained a line for
    the signature of Mrs. Zhuppa but at no time did she sign the release.  Upon
    returning home and discussing the meeting and the settlement offer with Mrs.
    Zhuppa, Mr. Zhuppa asked his son to write to Mr.&nbsp;Lewin on his behalf
    instructing Mr. Lewin to refuse the settlement and repeated his instruction
    not to forward the release.  Those instructions were emailed to Mr. Lewin
    at 2:40 p.m. approximately one hour after the settlement meeting.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the meantime, Mr. Lewin had provided the release signed by Mr. Zhuppa to
    Ms.&nbsp;Blaikie. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent brought a motion pursuant to rule 49.09 to enforce the settlement.  In
    support of the motion, the respondent’s counsel deposed that prior to the
    settlement meeting getting underway, Mr. Lewin advised everyone present that
    Mr. Zhuppa had a basic understanding of English but that his son would act
    as a translator as necessary.  Mr. Zhuppa confirmed that he had a basic understanding
    of English.  Ms. Blaikie also deposed that she had no doubt that either Pirro
    or Mr. Zhuppa understood what was occurring at the meeting and had no reason
    to believe that either of them did not understand the consequences of their
    actions.  In addition, the respondent relied on the affidavit of Mr. Lewin,
    filed in support of his application to remove himself as solicitor of record,
    which Mr. Lewin had provided to the respondent.  That affidavit states that
    the Zhuppas “changed their mind” about a settlement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motions judge was satisfied that Mr. Zhuppa knew the purpose of the settlement
    meeting.  He was also satisfied that Mr. Zhuppa understood the process, that
    he had a basic understanding of the English language and that his son was
    providing translation assistance to him.  The motion judge held that there
    was indeed an accepted offer to settle, which was enforceable pursuant to
    this court’s decision in <i>Scherer v. Paletta</i>, [1966] 2 O.R. 524 (C.A.).  That
    case holds that any limitation on the authority of a solicitor does not affect
    the opposite party with whom a settlement has been reached unless that limitation
    of authority is communicated to the opposite party.  The motion judge noted
    that there was nothing in the evidentiary record to suggest that Mr. Lewin
    did not have the authority to conduct the settlement meeting and to negotiate
    on the appellants’ behalf.  Further, the motion judge stated that there was
    nothing on the record that would cause the respondent’s counsel to question
    the apparent authority of Mr. Lewin.  The motion judge concluded that if
    the appellants had a problem with the terms of the settlement, their problem
    lay with their own lawyer.  He found that the Zhuppas changed their mind
    as to the settlement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our opinion the motion judge erred in failing to consider the uncontradicted
    evidence before him that Mrs. Zhuppa never agreed to the settlement terms
    and therefore could not have “ changed her mind”.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, the motion judge failed to consider that the principle in <i>Scherer
    v. Paletta, supra, </i>is subject to two important qualifications stated
    at p. 527.  The first is that the principle is, “ subject always to the discretionary
    power of the Court, if its intervention by the making of an order is required,
    to inquire into the circumstances and grant or withhold its intervention
    if it sees fit.”  The second is the disability of the client. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An
    application of the first qualification, or exception to the principle, is
    found in the decision in <i>Melios v. Zagas </i>(1998), 38O.R. (3d) 218 (Ont.C.A.).  That
    case concerned the rare situation where the settlement was entered into on
    the basis of a mistake concerning the settlement instructions, no order giving
    effect to the settlement had been taken out, there was no prejudice to the
    defendant apart from losing the benefit of the settlement, and no third parties
    would be affected if the settlement were not enforced.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> Similarly,
    in this case, the evidence of mistake concerning the instructions as to the
    granting of the release, the clear instructions rejecting the settlement
    given within a very short time prior to any order giving effect to the settlement
    being taken out, and the lack of prejudice to the defendant apart from losing
    the benefit of the settlement as well as the absence of any affected third
    parties, were factors that called for further examination as in <i>Melios.</i>  Respectfully,
    the motion judge failed to undertake such an examination. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    regard to the similarity of these factors to <i>Melios, supra, </i>we order
    that the judgment be set aside and that the respondent’s motion for judgment
    declaring that the action has been settled be dismissed.  We further order
    that the respondent pay the appellants’ costs of the motion fixed at $6500
    all inclusive as well as the costs of the appeal fixed at $10,000 all inclusive
    on a partial indemnity basis.</p>
