    Freeland brought a motion pursuant to rule 21.01(1) of the <i>Rules of Civil
    Procedure </i> to have the action against her dismissed as statute-barred.  She
    relied on s. 78 of the Act which creates a six-month limitation period.  Section
    78 reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>78.  All actions, prosecutions or other proceedings
    against any person or psychiatric facility for anything done or omitted to
    be done in pursuance or intended pursuance of this Act or the regulations
    shall be commenced within six months after the act or omission complained
    of occurred and not afterwards.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    response, the appellants moved for a declaration that the limitation period
    in s.&nbsp;78 of the Act contravened s.&nbsp;15(1) of the <i>Charter</i> or,
    alternatively, that s.&nbsp;78 did not apply to their claim against Dr. Freeland.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motions were heard by Roy J.  By order dated October 3, 2005, he granted
    Dr.&nbsp;Freeland’s motion and dismissed the appellants’ action against her.  He
    held that the appellants’ claim against Dr. Freeland was subject to the six-month
    limitation period prescribed by s. 78 of the Act.  As the appellants had
    not commenced their action within that six-month period, he held their claim
    to be statute-barred.  He dismissed the appellants’ motion, holding that
    the six-month limitation period established by s.&nbsp;78 did not contravene
    s.&nbsp;15(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants ask this court to set aside the order below.  They argue that
    the motion judge erred in failing to find s.&nbsp;78 of the Act to be unconstitutional
    and in holding that s.&nbsp;78 applies to their action against Dr. Freeland.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>Section 15 of the Charter </span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge held that s. 78 of the Act does not violate s. 15(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.  I
    agree.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge began by noting that the equality guarantee in s. 15(1) is comparative
    in nature and that discrimination does not exist in a vacuum.  Claims of
    differential treatment and substantive discrimination can be evaluated only
    by a comparison between the claimants and an appropriate comparator group.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the claimant group is the family of a mentally ill person where
    the family is suing a mental health professional who provides services at
    a mental health facility.  The motion judge found, and I agree, that the
    proper comparator group was “families of non-mentally ill persons asserting
    an action pursuant to the <i>Mental Health Act</i>”.  As he explains in para.&nbsp;39
    of his reasons:    </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Unfortunately for the plaintiffs, the comparator
    group [they] suggested is far too broad and does not conform to the criteria
    set out by the Supreme Court.  The plaintiffs appear to be suggesting that
    the comparator group are those people seeking access to justice and recourse
    for any wrongful act.  They argue that the correct comparator group is any
    plaintiff who is subject to a limitation period which is longer than the
    limitation period in the <i>Mental Health Act</i>.  They conclude therefore
    that the claimant group, that is the family of mentally ill persons, suing
    a mental health facility or professional is being discriminated against.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge then applied the three-step test for determining whether s.
    15(1) of the <i>Charter</i> is violated.</p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Is
      there differential treatment under the law? </i> The motion judge found
      that s.&nbsp;78 of the Act does not draw any distinctions based on personal
      characteristics that would result in unequal treatment:  the six-month
      limitation period applies equally to individuals and families with or without
      mental disabilities.  Thus, there is no differential treatment.  I agree.</p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Are
      there enumerated grounds or analogous grounds?</i>  The appellants’ claim
      of differential treatment is based on the enumerated ground of “mental
      disability” and the analogous ground of “family relationship”.  As the
      motion judge held, there is no evidence that any of the appellants suffer
      from a mental disability.  Therefore, they are not members of an enumerated
      group entitled to s. 15(1) protection.  While Michael suffers from a mental
      illness, leaving aside the question of whether that falls within the meaning
      of “mental disability”, he is not a party to the litigation.  </p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify'>The motion judge stated, at para. 43 of his reasons, that “None
    of the jurisprudence referred to by the parties indicate that family relationships
    can be an analogous ground for the purposes of s. 15(1).”  I agree and would
    add that this court recently expressed doubt as to whether family status
    could constitute an analogous ground for the purposes of s. 15(1) where the
    claim of the family members is based not on their own characteristics or
    identity but, rather, on the characteristics or identity of another member
    of the family.  See <i>Wynberg v. The Queen</i> (2006), 40 C.C.L.T. (3d)
    176 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 206.  </p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Is
      s. 78 discriminatory in a substantive sense?</i>  The fundamental question
      to be asked is whether, taking the perspective of a reasonable person in
      circumstances similar to those of the claimants, the law has the effect
      of demeaning the claimants’
    human dignity.  The motion judge held that a reasonable person would not
    find that the human dignity of the appellants had been demeaned by s. 78
    of the Act.  Although briefly stated, I see no error in his determination.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Like
    the motion judge, I am of the view that as none of the three steps are met,
    there is no need to consider s. 1 of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>Section 78 of the Act and
        the Duty to Warn</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    Michael is not a plaintiff in the action, the statement of claim frames the
    action as allegations of negligence by Dr. Freeland in connection with the
    care and treatment that she provided to Michael while he was a patient at
    the Hospital.  While less clear from the Statement of Claim, the appellants
    also allege that Dr. Freeland was negligent in that she breached her duty
    of care to June Stewart in various ways, including by failing to warn her
    of the threat to her safety caused by Michael leaving the Hospital grounds
    (hereafter compendiously referred to as the “duty to warn”).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge held that Dr. Freeland’s alleged actions and inactions, including
    the duty to warn, flowed directly from the duties imposed upon the Hospital
    and her by the Act.  Accordingly, he held that the claim for breach of those
    duties was subject to the limitation period in s. 78.  In so concluding,
    the motion judge relied on <i>Perez (Litigation Guardian of) v. Salvation
    Army </i>(1997), 37 O.R. (3d) 447 (Gen. Div.), aff’d (1998), 42 O.R. (3d)
    229 (C.A.). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Perez</i> at
    p. 232, this court explained that the Act and regulations:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>…&nbsp;clearly place a duty
    on psychiatric facilities to provide services to persons suffering from mental
    disorders.  For patients in those facilities, those services include observation,
    care and treatment.  The Act recognizes and gives statutory force to the
    duty to treat those who are patients in the facility.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court also considered the approach to be taken to s. 78.  It will be recalled
    that s. 78 reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>78.  <i>All actions</i>, prosecutions or other
    proceedings <i>against any</i> <i>person </i>or psychiatric facility <i>for
    anything done or omitted to</i> <i>be done in pursuance or intended pursuance
    of this Act or the regulations</i> shall be commenced within six months after
    the act or omission complained of occurred and not afterwards.  [emphasis
    added]  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> After
    stating that statutory limitation periods like s. 78 are to be strictly construed,
    this court referred with approval to <i>Fenton v. North York Electric Commission </i>(1996),
    29 O.R. (3d) 481 (C.A.) at 485, in which the phrase “in pursuance of this
    Act” was held to refer “only to those acts done in direct execution of a
    statutory duty or acts which are necessarily incidental to the carrying out
    of a statutory duty”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no question but that Dr. Freeland acted in execution of her statutory
    duty when she provided Michael with care and treatment while he was at the
    Hospital.  Thus, to the extent that the appellants’ action against Dr. Freeland
    is based on the care and treatment that she provided to Michael, bearing
    in mind my conclusion that s. 78 is constitutionally valid, the appellants’ action
    is statute-barred as it was brought after the six-month limitation period
    provided by s. 78.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    there is nothing in the Act that explicitly governs the obligations of health
    care providers to third parties who may be at risk of being harmed by a psychiatric
    patient.  The respondent argues that if there is a duty to warn, it is
    “necessarily incidental” to the carrying out of a duty under the Act, as
    the psychiatric institution has an obligation to Michael and the public to
    see that he does not harm others.  That may be.  On the other hand, it may
    be that if there is a duty to warn, it arises only at common law.  If so,
    it does not appear that it would be governed by s. 78.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent argues that this uncertainty is resolved by the statement of this
    court at p. 232 of <i>Perez</i>:
    “The fact that other statutes or the common law may also impose duties on
    some or all of the respondents which overlap with those imposed by the Act
    is of no consequence to the application of s. 78 of the Act”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    this stage of the proceedings, I do not see <i>Perez </i>as a full answer.  In <i>Perez</i>,
    the hospital’s obligations under the Act and at common law overlapped.  Here,
    the Act may not impose any duty on the respondent in relation to June Stewart.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Perez </i>was
    commenced after Albert Perez, an involuntary psychiatric patient at the Salvation
    Army Scarborough Grace Hospital, smashed a window in his third-floor hospital
    room and jumped off the window ledge to his death.  His widow, children and
    other surviving family members brought a claim against the hospital alleging
    that it had failed to provide safe facilities for Mr. Perez and to properly
    supervise him.  The hospital argued that the claim was statute-barred because
    it was commenced after the expiry of the six-month limitation period set
    out in s. 78 of the Act.  Mr. Perez’s family responded that some of the matters
    at issue in their claim (<i>e.g. </i>inadequate staffing and escape protocols)
    did not relate to acts done “in pursuance” of the Act and that, therefore,
    s. 78 did not apply.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    the court of first instance and this court concluded that because the Perez
    family’s claim was based on alleged breaches of duties created by the Act,
    s. 78 applied and the claim was barred.  Even though the Perez family’s claim
    raised some specific factual matters that were not regulated by the Act (such
    as whether the hospital had an obligation to bolt down the chairs in the
    hospital room), the case related entirely to the hospital’s over-arching
    duty to provide proper treatment to Mr. Perez.  That is, the family’s claim
    was based entirely on alleged breaches of duties owed by the hospital to
    Mr. Perez, the patient.  Because the family’s claim was based on purported
    deficiencies in the provision of services to the patient himself, s. 78 of
    the Act applied.  In the present case, as previously explained, the claim
    is based not only on the provision of services to Michael but also on an
    alleged duty of care that Dr. Freeland may have owed to June Stewart, independent
    of her duties to Michael.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent in this case moved for an order dismissing the action on a question
    of law pursuant to rule 21.01.  On such a motion, the action must not be
    struck unless it is “plain and obvious” that it cannot succeed.  As it is
    not “plain and obvious” on the facts, as assumed from the pleadings, that
    the claim relating to the duty to warn cannot succeed, the action should
    be allowed to proceed in that regard.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would dismiss the appellants’ motion for a declaration that s. 78 is inapplicable
    to their action.  Whether it applies to the alleged duty to warn owed by
    Dr. Freeland to June Stewart is a question better left for trial against
    a full evidentiary record.  At that time, if it is held that the duty to

      I would allow the appeal in part.  I would vary paragraph 1 of the order
      below to reflect that the appellants’
    action is dismissed only as it relates to the negligence claim against Dr.
    Freeland in respect of the care and treatment of Michael.  To the extent
    that the appellants’ claim is based on Dr. Freeland’s alleged negligence
    in respect of a duty of care to June Stewart, I would permit the action to
    continue.       </span></p>

      the oral hearing of this appeal, I understood counsel for the appellants
      to acknowledge that if the action were permitted to continue on the duty
      to warn claim alone, the Statement of Claim would have to be amended.  I
      agree.  Therefore, I would order the appellants to file an amended claim,
      in conformity with these reasons, within 45 days of the date of release
      of these reasons.       </span></p>

      on the same within fourteen days of the date of the release of these reasons.  </span></p>
