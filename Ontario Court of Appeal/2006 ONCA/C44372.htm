    action arose out of an accident that occurred in July 1999, when Jasmin Momand
    struck her head on a water slide operated by the defendant (appellant) causing
    injuries to her head, neck and shoulder area.  Initially Ms. Momand was diagnosed
    with a whiplash injury to her neck and a concussion to her head.  The concussion
    was subsequently confirmed by a neurologist.  Since the accident, Ms. Momand
    has suffered constant migraines, which have affected her sleep and her ability
    to carry on normal activities of life.  Migraine medication has provided
    some relief, but for financial reasons, Ms. Momand could not continue to
    take this medication on a regular basis.  The migraine headaches were determined
    by a neurologist to be directly causally related to the head injuries suffered
    in July 1999.  A physiatrist who examined Ms. Momand reported she was suffering
    from soft tissue (myofacial) pain syndrome which she opined was chronic.  The
    chronicity of the pain related to Ms. Momand’s soft tissue injuries was confirmed
    by a defence medical.</p>

    there was an intervening car accident in January 2004, in which Ms. Momand
    was injured, her injuries from that accident resolved within four months
    and there is no evidence of her suffering a head injury at that time. </p>

    a result of the injuries suffered by Ms. Momand, she has been unable to socialize
    on a regular basis and has difficulty caring for her family, which includes
    her husband and two young children.  She has become anxious and depressed.</p>

line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    graduating as a dental assistant in June 2004, Ms. Momand obtained part-time
    work; however, in April 2005, due to her migraines she was forced to stop.  It
    has been determined on a vocational evaluation that her best prospects for
    future employment are in the field of retails sales.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to other awards, Sachs J. awarded the sum of $201,230.72 for future
    loss of income and a total of $82,728.27 for future care costs, which included
    the sum of $46,742.00 for the future cost of the drug Zomig.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    test in a situation where the trial judge has evidence upon which to make
    a finding of fact requires a palpable and overriding error.  As to the calculation
    of damages for future loss of income, it is position of the appellant that
    the learned trial judge applied incorrect income numbers.  We disagree.  The
    figures accepted by the trial judge were based upon her proper exercise of
    discretion as applied to the evidence as a whole.  The trial judge, in paragraph
    65 of her decision, clearly indicated there was evidence before her from
    which she was able to select a figure for future earning capacity somewhere
    between the upper and lower limits as suggested in the evidence.  Moreover,
    the trial judge tempered the award for damages for future loss of income
    in two important respects.  First, she fixed Ms. Momand’s income capacity
    at $30,500 per year when she could just as easily have accepted evidence
    that Ms. Momand could work only one or two days a week or that indeed, she
    might never realistically hold any form of gainful employment.  In other
    words, the trial judge could easily have chosen another figure which could
    have resulted in the claim for future loss being greater.  Furthermore, the
    trial judge determined that Ms. Momand’s pre-injury anticipated retirement
    age would be 60, when she could reasonably have determined the retirement
    age to have been later.  We would therefore not interfere with the trial
    judge’s calculation of damages for future loss of income.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    to the submission that the trial judge erred in failing to reduce the amount
    awarded for Ms. Momand’s Zomig medication by the expected decreased cost
    over time due to generic competition, we agree with the appellant’s submission.  There
    was clear evidence of potential future costs savings due to generic competition
    and precious little evidence of any offsetting contingency.  In our view,
    it would be appropriate to reduce the award for the cost of Zomig medication
    by $10,000, bringing that amount to $36,742.00.</p>
