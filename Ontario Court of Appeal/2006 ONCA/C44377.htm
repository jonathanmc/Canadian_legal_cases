  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals from the August 22, 2005 disposition of the Ontario Review
    Board that he be detained in the minimum secure unit of the Whitby Mental
    Health Centre (“WMHC”).  He advances two grounds of appeal.  First, he argues
    that the Board erred in admitting a police summary of prior criminal activity
    and police investigations relating to the appellant, among other matters,
    thereby impairing hearing fairness and denying the appellant fundamental
    justice.  Second, he submits that the Board’s decision was unreasonable and
    that he should have received an absolute or conditional discharge from the
    WMHC.  Notwithstanding the able argument of Ms. Buie, we reject these grounds
    of appeal.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant properly concedes that the Board enjoys a wide latitude to receive
    hearsay evidence, that its process is primarily inquisitorial rather than
    adversarial in nature, and that it is vested with certain of the powers envisaged
    by the <i>Inquiries Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-11.  In our view, given the
    breadth of this authority, the Board was entitled to receive and consider
    the challenged police summary and it made no error in admitting the summary
    at this review hearing.  Indeed, we observe that much of the evidence received
    by the Board in its hearings is in the nature of hearsay evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    summary was clearly relevant to the matters in issue at the hearing.  At
    least some, if not all, of the information contained in the summary had been
    admitted by the Board at earlier annual review hearings concerning this NCR
    (not criminally responsible) accused.  As reflected in its reasons for admitting
    the summary, the Board is accustomed to evaluating hearsay evidence and is
    aware of the dangers inherent in evidence of this type.  In addition, the
    appellant waived any right to cross-examine the author of the summary regarding
    the reliability of the contents of the summary or the sources of the information
    contained in the summary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    and importantly, we do not accept the appellant’s contention that the Board’s
    reasons demonstrate that the Board relied on the summary in making its disposition
    in this case.  In our view, the Board’s reasons, properly read, do not support
    this claim.  It is apparent that much of the historical and other information
    referenced by the Board was detailed in the hospital reports before the Board.  More
    significantly, the Board’s reasons indicate that it was highly influenced
    by and accepted the evidence of the appellant’s treating psychiatrist, Dr.
    Chapman, and the evidence emanating from the appellant’s treatment team.  </p>

lang=EN-US>Reasonableness of Disposition</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    do we accept that the Board’s disposition was unreasonable.  There was strong
    evidence to support the Board’s risk assessment concerning the appellant.  This
    assessment, which falls squarely within the expertise of the Board, attracts
    considerable deference from this court.  See <i>R. v. Owen</i>, [2003] 1
    S.C.R. 779 and <i>Winko v. British Columbia (Forensic Psychiatric Institute)</i>,
    [1999] 2 S.C.R. 625.  We see no basis to interfere with it.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are also of the view that the Board’s disposition, including the conditions
    imposed, was crafted by the Board with a view to the liberty interests of
    the appellant.  We are satisfied, on the facts of this case, that the disposition
    reflects the least onerous and least restrictive disposition available in
    the circumstances, consistent with the need to protect the public from the
    appellant.  The Board’s disposition was reasonable and supported by the evidence
    at the review hearing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    for the reasons given, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
