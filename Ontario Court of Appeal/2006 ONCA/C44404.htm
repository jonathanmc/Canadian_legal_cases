    divorce, awarding the respondent father custody of their now four year old

    the opening of trial, appellant’s counsel requested a short adjournment to
    give time for her client to attend.  The trial judge refused the request
    and proceeded in the absence of the appellant.  The appellant argues that,
    in the circumstances of this case, by doing so, the trial judge denied her
    the opportunity to be heard contrary to the principles of natural justice.  The
    appellant further submits that the trial judge misconstrued the evidence
    and ought not to have changed the <i>de facto</i> custody of a child of tender
    years from the appellant mother, the primary caregiver, to the respondent
    as there were insufficient grounds to do so.  For the reasons that follow,
    I would, upon proper terms, order a new trial on the issues of custody and
    contempt.</p>

      child born May 2, 2002.  They separated on March 31, 2003, when the appellant
      advised the respondent that she was not returning from a visit to her parents’ home
      in Gatineau Quebec.</span></p>

      April 11, 2003, the respondent commenced the divorce proceeding claiming,
      among other things, custody and the return of his daughter.  On May 16,
      2003, the parties were ordered to jointly parent their daughter.  The appellant,
      however, was the primary caregiver.  The respondent was to have access
      every other weekend from Friday evening to Tuesday at noon in Mississauga.</span></p>

      proceedings in this matter disclose that the respondent faced ongoing problems
      in obtaining the access ordered by the courts.  The parties attended half
      a dozen motions, including one motion for leave to appeal in order to set
      the terms of access.  Included among these are two motions for contempt
      that were adjourned to trial following the making of interim orders. </span></p>

      of May 13, 2004, the respondent was to have access about four days out
      of fourteen with the appellant dropping the child off in Mississauga and
      the respondent delivering the child to Aylmer, Quebec.  As of February
      2005, the appellant ceased bringing the child to Mississauga for the father’s
      access.  The appellant initiated proceedings in the Province of Quebec
      on the basis that as the child’s principal residence was in Quebec, Quebec
      was the appropriate forum despite the fact that the matter was set for
      trial in Brampton.  The trial was to last eight days commencing May 9,
      2005.  The date was peremptory to both parties.  Despite a further court
      order, by the date of trial the appellant had yet to resume delivering
      the child to Mississauga in accordance with the access order.  </span></p>

      that there was no judge available to commence the trial on Monday, May
      9, but that one may become available later in the week.  The parties and
      their counsel were told to attend, without witnesses, on Monday afternoon
      at 2:00 p.m. for a “mini pre-trial.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      appellant’s solicitor advised the appellant that the trial would not commence
      on the Monday as previously ordered, served the appellant with materials
      seeking to be removed from the record and advised her of the need to attend
      the mini pre-trial.  On the morning of Monday, May 9, appellant’s counsel’s
      secretary spoke with the appellant and the appellant advised that she would
      not be attending and that her counsel had better attend.  The appellant’s
      only instruction to her solicitor at that point was that she should get
      the matter put off.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Counsel
      appeared in court Monday afternoon.  The judge commenced by asking: “Does
      somebody want to tell me what’s going on?  This is supposed to be a pre-trial.  Both
      clients are supposed to be here.”  Appellant’s counsel advised that she
      was moving to be removed from the record and that her client would not
      be there and had asked to have the matter put off.  The judge then heard
      submissions from the respondent’s solicitor concerning the difficulties
      encountered in obtaining the court ordered access.  Upon receiving this
      information, the court responded: “Well, there may not be a judge for a
      pre-trial, a last minute pre-trial, but maybe I’ll sit as the trial judge.”  She
      then commenced the trial, dismissed the appellant’s solicitor’s request
      to be removed from the record and refused the appellant’s counsel’s request
      to have the matter adjourned until the next morning in order to give her
      client an opportunity to attend the trial.  With respect to the length
      of the trial, the trial judge revised the eight-day estimate and stated: “[I]t
      won’t be eight days if the other side isn’t appearing.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      asked by the judge whether she was ready to proceed, the respondent’s solicitor
      said that, although the parties had been told that the trial would not
      commence that day and were not to bring their witnesses, she had her client
      present and could call him as the first witness.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      trial commenced, the respondent gave evidence and was cross-examined.  Appellant’s
      counsel had understood that the trial judge would complete the matter that
      day and, therefore, had closed her cross-examination of the respondent.  Upon
      being advised by the court that the matter was going to be continued the
      next day and that the reexamination of the respondent would be put over
      to then, counsel for the appellant sought permission to continue the cross-examination
      of the respondent the next day.  This, she explained, would allow her the
      opportunity to review her file which, because the matter was not to proceed
      to trial that day, she had left in her office.  The trial judge refused.  The
      appellant’s counsel then requested a short one-hour adjournment to allow
      her to review the court file to determine whether any further cross-examination
      of the respondent was necessary.  The court refused this short adjournment
      and advised counsel that if she was unhappy with this, “the Court of Appeal
      is always looking for work.”</span></p>

      the opening of the second day, counsel for the appellant advised the court
      that, after leaving court the previous day, she had called her client just
      before 5:00 p.m. and left a message for her at work and had not been able
      to reach her at home.  She had also left a message on a cell phone number
      that she had.  She had yet to communicate with her client and, therefore,
      again requested an adjournment.  It was denied.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      trial therefore continued.  The respondent was reexamined at length and
      the respondent’s mother gave evidence.  Counsel for the respondent closed
      her case in the course of the morning and, in the circumstances, appellant’s
      counsel advised that she had no evidence to call.  At this point, appellant’s
      counsel advised the court that upon returning to her office the previous
      evening she had been able to retrieve and review her file.  There was an
      outstanding motion to change the venue or stay the proceedings on the basis
      that the Quebec court had jurisdiction in this matter.  The judge agreed
      that it ought to have been heard before the matter proceeded.  The judge
      asked for submissions on the motion.  The balance of that day and part
      of the next day were devoted to arguing this motion and making final submissions
      with respect to the trial itself.</span></p>

      the close of the second day of proceedings, appellant’s counsel indicated
      that she had understood that the matter would be completed that day.  She
      had not anticipated that it would go into a third day and would make arrangements
      to cancel her commitments for that day.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      the beginning of the third day, appellant’s counsel advised that, upon
      returning to her office the previous evening, she had received a fax letter
      from her client sent at 1:48 p.m. that day.  The letter asked that several
      issues be raised in the course of the trial.  It also stated: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>I just received your voicemail of yesterday.  You know that I leave
      the office between 4:00 and 4:30 p.m.  Your message was incomprehensible;
      I don’t understand how a trial can proceed when you have not called any
      witnesses and had just asked to be removed from the record… It has taken
      two years to get to trial and now I will not be having a proper trial.  This
      is completely unacceptable.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;

      the end of the third day the trial judge took the matter under reserve.  The
      decision was issued several weeks later.  Custody of the child was awarded
      to the respondent and the appellant was ordered to have access at least
      every other week from Wednesday to Sunday.  The appellant was also held
      in contempt of three previous court orders and ordered to pay costs on
      a substantial indemnity basis as well as a fine of $5,000.  </span></p>

    for the mini pre-trial but submits that the sanction for her failure to appear
    ought not to have been to convert the scheduled pre-trial into a trial and
    to proceed with it in her absence.  Both parties had been advised that no
    judge was available to commence the trial on Monday, May 9, and that the
    parties and their solicitors were to attend that afternoon for a mini pre-trial
    without witnesses.  Both counsel clearly understood that the trial would
    not start that day although it could possibly start later that week if a
    judge became available.  Neither party’s counsel was gowned.  No witnesses
    were present and the appellant’s counsel did not in fact have her file with
    her that day.</p>

    appellant was from out of town, residing in Gatineau, Quebec and working
    in Ottawa.  Her decision not to attend on the Monday and her request that
    the matter be put off should, the appellant submits, be considered in context.  She
    knew that the trial would not proceed that day, that her counsel was moving
    to be removed from the record and that there was an outstanding motion to
    have the Ontario proceedings stayed pending the outcome of the Quebec proceedings.  Although
    she ought to have attended the mini pre-trial, there was no suggestion that
    she would not attend the trial.</p>

    record does not disclose precisely when the appellant first became aware
    of the fact that the trial was proceeding.  The only clear indication is
    that by 1:40 p.m. on the second day of trial, after the respondent’s evidence
    had been completed, the appellant was aware of the trial, as she transmitted
    some instructions to her counsel.  She likely became aware of the trial proceedings
    sometime earlier that day.  Her counsel had left a voice mail at her office
    after she had left for the day on Monday.  The content of that message was
    not made part of the record, but one might have expected it to contain privileged
    communication such as an assessment of the first day’s proceedings and counsel’s
    expectation as to the next day’s proceedings, including counsel’s understanding
    that the trial would be completed on that second day.  In any event, the

    my view, the trial judge may well have misunderstood the information she
    was given and believed that the appellant’s advice to her solicitor that
    the matter should be put off and that she would not attend related to the
    trial and not to the mini pre-trial.  This is apparent from the statement
    in her reasons that the appellant “chose not to personally attend trial” and
    from comments made by the trial judge, such as the comment made on the second
    day that “[s]he [the appellant] knew that this was going ahead.  She actually
    knew that you were briefly in court yesterday and advised you to delay it”.  From
    my review of the record, the appellant’s comments that she would not attend
    and that she wished to have the matter put off likely related to the mini
    pre-trial scheduled for the Monday.  This and the motion by her solicitor
    to be removed from the record would be the only things she would have known
    were going ahead on the Monday.  Had the appellant been advised that the
    trial would be proceeding the next day or later that week, there is no suggestion
    in the record that, given the opportunity and time necessary to travel from
    Ottawa to Brampton, she would not have attended.  The tone of the letter
    to her solicitor sent on the second day suggests to me that she was in fact
    intent on participating at the trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    I disagree with the trial judge’s characterization of the two motions (the
    motion by the appellant’s solicitor to be removed from the record and the
    request for an adjournment of the trial to the following day) as being made
    by the appellant for “tactical reasons” to frustrate and delay the trial.  The
    appellant was not the author of the motion by her solicitor to be removed
    from the record and her inability to pay her solicitor’s fees is in no way
    tactical.  The motion to adjourn the trial to the next day would, if granted,
    have had minimal impact in terms of delay and, given that the court had advised
    the parties that the trial would not start that day, the motion could hardly
    be seen as tactical.</p>

    the circumstances, the trial judge ought not to have commenced the trial
    on the afternoon of May 9.  Further, having decided that she would proceed
    with the trial, she ought to have granted the appellant’s request for an
    adjournment at least to the following morning.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    clearly would have been no harm or prejudice to either party if the trial
    judge had granted the requested adjournment to the following day.  Having
    come to argue a motion to be removed from the record and knowing that no
    judge was available to commence the trial that day, appellant’s counsel was
    clearly unprepared for trial.  The short adjournment would have allowed the
    appellant’s counsel the afternoon to contact her client, retrieve her gown
    and file from her office and obtain clear instructions.  Also, assuming contact
    could be made that afternoon, this would have given the appellant the opportunity
    to travel to Brampton to attend trial the next day.  Instead, the trial commenced
    and the crucial evidence of the respondent was heard, including cross-examination,
    before appellant’s counsel could access her file or leave a message with
    the appellant that the trial was proceeding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s refusal of appellant’s counsel’s request to carry over the
    cross-examination of the respondent to the following day, in order to allow
    her time to review her file and communicate with her client, gave rise to
    additional concern.  Although appellant’s counsel had closed her cross-examination
    of the respondent, she explained that she had done so only because of her
    understanding that the trial judge had determined that the matter would be
    completed that day.  Again, no harm or prejudice would have been suffered
    by the respondent if the cross-examination had been carried over into the
    following day or, at a minimum, the one hour adjournment requested by appellant
    counsel to review the court file had been granted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    far as we can tell, by the time the appellant received the message, the trial
    had commenced and the respondent’s evidence was complete.  As set out earlier,
    the content of the message she received was not made part of the record but
    it likely included an assessment of what happened on the first day and that
    her counsel expected that the trial would finish on the second day. There
    would have been little point in the appellant making arrangements to travel
    to Brampton in an attempt to attend before the trial ended.  The appellant
    should, however, have written to the court explaining her absence and clearly
    stating that she had been willing to appear at her trial whenever scheduled.  Given
    how this matter unfolded, this probably would have been seen as self-serving
    and as asking the judge to turn back the clock.  In the end, the appellant
    simply attempted to give last minute instructions to her solicitor and expressed
    her frustration with the situation.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issues involved in this trial were very significant.  There were three allegations
    of contempt and the respondent proposed changing the custody of a child of
    tender years.  The issues involved went beyond the interest of the two parties.  Because
    the issues required an analysis of the best interest of the child, the need
    for procedural fairness was amplified.  (See <i>Catholic Children’s Aid Society
    of Metropolitan</i> <i>Toronto v. O. (L.M.)</i> (1996), 139 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>)
    534 (Ont. Ct. Gen. Div.) aff’d (1997), 149 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 464 (Ont.
    C.A.).)  In determining the appropriate child custody arrangement, the court
    should have been cautious before proceeding in the absence of the primary
    caregiver. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the appellant clearly had an obligation to attend the mini pre-trial scheduled
    for the afternoon of May 9, her failure to do so should not have resulted
    in her losing the right to be present at the trial.  There were other sanctions
    available to the judge that could have been applied other than proceeding
    with a trial on the merits in her absence.  With respect to the access issues
    and alleged failure to comply with prior court orders, the court could, if
    so inclined, have dealt with these matters on an interim basis.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, by proceeding in the manner that she did, the trial judge denied
    the appellant procedural fairness with the result that the rules of natural
    justice were undermined.  The appellant was, in effect, denied the right
    to be heard, a right which is fundamental to our justice system, as she could
    not participate at the trial or give evidence.  (See <i>Supermarchés Jean
    Labrecque Inc. v. Flamand</i>, [1987] 2 SCR 219 at para. 46.)</p>

      conclusion, I would, upon proper terms, set aside those portions of the
      trial judge’s order dealing with custody and contempt.  The appellant is
      not asking that the other aspects of the order be set aside.  In light
      of this result, I would also set aside those portions of the judgment dealing
      with costs.  Costs, other than those for the trial itself, which I will
      address, would be determined at the new trial.  Given my reasons on the
      procedural fairness issue, I need not address the other grounds of appeal.</span></p>

      would probably be no need to repeat the trial in this matter were it not
      for the appellant’s conduct and her unexplained failure to appear on May

      about $48,000 per year.  He is of limited means and has incurred substantial
      costs and expenses in the course of the proceedings.  His conduct cannot
      be faulted and he ought, therefore, to be restored to his pre-trial position
      in so far as it is within the power of this court to do so.  Accordingly,
      I would allow the appeal, set aside paragraphs 2, 6, 7, 10 and 16 of the
      order and order a new trial of the custody and contempt issues upon the
      following terms:</span></p>

      am concerned, however, that disruption to the child be kept to a minimum.  The
      respondent has had custody of the child for over a year.  The appellant
      asks that custody be changed to the situation in effect before the trial
      judge’s order.  In my view, that is not in the best interest of the child.  Assuming
      that the above-noted condition is met, it is in the interest of the child
      that the present custody and access arrangements be continued on an interim
      basis pending the new trial on the custody and contempt issues.  I would
      so order, and provide that nothing in these reasons is intended to interfere
      with the jurisdiction of the Superior Court to vary as if the order were
      an order of that court.</span></p>

      as required at the pre-trial that triggered the events that ensued.  In
      light of this fact and taking into account the circumstances of this case,
