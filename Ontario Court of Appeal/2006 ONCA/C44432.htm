line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For purposes of this appeal we assume, as the trial
    judge did, that money was misappropriated.  The issue is whether the trial judge erred in finding that the
    appellants had not established that it was the respondent, Greenglass, who
    stole the money.  The appellants’ main
    argument is that the trial judge erred in applying a standard of proof that was
    greater than a balance of probabilities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the trial judge used some language to suggest
    that he may have applied a higher standard, it is by no means clear that he
    did.  In any event, we are satisfied that
    the trial judge concluded on the facts as he found them that the evidence
    implicating Greenglass raised a suspicion, nothing more.  That finding falls short of proof on a
    balance of probabilities that Greenglass stole money as the appellants alleged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s conclusion that the evidence raised
    only a suspicion was amply supported by the evidence.  The trial judge, for good reason, rejected
    the discovery evidence of Szijjarto and quite reasonably did not attach any
    weight to the adding machine tapes.  Thus, there was no direct evidence that Greenglass was the thief.  While all of the circumstances and the
    Greenglass’ evidence raised suspicions about his role in the handling of the
    receipts from the Flea Market, there were opportunities for Szijjarto, and
    perhaps others, to have stolen the money as well.  In the end, we are of the view that the trial
    judge quite rightly saw this as a case where suspicions about the Greenglass’
    role were raised but adequate proof was lacking.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The conclusion that the appellants failed to establish
    that Greenglass misappropriated the money disposes of the appellants’ argument
    that Greenglass is liable as a trustee <i>de son tort</i>.  Greenglass bore no obligation to account for
    money that he did not receive.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>Negligence</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge dismissed the claim for negligence on the basis that neither
    Village nor Greenglass had responsibility for the management of the Flea
    Market.  Thus the trial judge concluded
    that Greenglass did not have a duty of care with respect to the operation of
    the Flea Market upon which to found a claim for negligence.  In our view, there was evidence to support
    the trial judge’s finding.  To start
    there was no written agreement or other document indicating that Village or
    Greenglass had such management responsibilities. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further,
    the evidence established that Brad-Jay,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    not
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Village,
    employed Szijjarto directly to manage the Flea Market.  Brad-Jay paid Szijjarto a salary and she was
    the individual responsible for the week-to-week management functions.  She did not report to Village, and did not
    take direction from Village or Greenglass about how the Flea Market should be
    operated.  The trial judge found it
    significant that Brad-Jay’s Board’s auditor reviewed how the Flea Market was
    operated, examined its internal controls, was satisfied with those controls and
    never suggested changes to those controls.  In addition, the trial judge noted that Brad-Jay never asked the auditor
    to implement different controls.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly,
    while Greenglass received Flea Market earnings from Szijjarto and deposited
    them, he did not undertake management responsibilities.  Greenglass’ role as found by the trial judge
    was as a conduit between Szijjarto and the Board of Brad-Jay. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although
    Village received a share of the proceeds from the Flea Market, this was
    consistent with Village’s role as the mall manager.  As such, it was open for the trial judge to
    conclude that Village received its share of the proceeds for that reason and
    not as compensation for managing the Flea Market or supervising the collection
    of funds from vendors at the Flea Market.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Consequently,
    we see no basis for interfering with the trial judge’s conclusion that
    Greenglass did not owe a duty of care to the appellants in the management of
    the Flea Market.</span></p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>Disgorgement</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is not clear that the trial judge found that
    Greenglass breached a fiduciary duty.  However, assuming that his finding that Greenglass’ outside activities
    and his dishonesty in failing to disclose those outside activities to Village
    amounted to a breach of fiduciary duty, we consider whether the trial judge
    erred in declining to grant a remedy of disgorgement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Initially, Village asserted that as a matter of law
    once a breach of fiduciary duty is established, the person owed that duty is
    entitled to disgorgement of the fiduciary’s profits whether that person
    suffered lost profits or damage or would not have taken advantage of the
    opportunities appropriated by the fiduciary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, in oral
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    argument
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Village
    recognized the law is more nuanced and all the circumstances must be considered
    in fashioning the appropriate remedy for a particular case.  As MacLaclin J. pointed out in <i>Soulos v.
    Korkontzilas</i>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 217, “Equitable remedies are flexible, their
    award is based on what is just in all the circumstances of the case.”  In discussing the basis for the imposition of
    a constructive trust for breach of a fiduciary duty she said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>[A]constructive trust
    may be imposed where good conscience so requires.&nbsp;&nbsp;The inquiry into
    good conscience is informed by the situations where constructive trusts have
    been recognized in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also informed by the dual reasons
    for which constructive trusts have traditionally been imposed:&nbsp;&nbsp;to do
    justice between the parties and to maintain the integrity of institutions
    dependent on trust-like relationships.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Finally, it is informed by
    the absence of an indication that a constructive trust would have an unfair or
    unjust effect on the defendant or third parties, matters which equity has
    always taken into account.</u> [Emphasis added.]&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are of the view that the trial judge was within his
    discretion to decline to grant disgorgement in all the circumstances of this
    case.  The trial judge pointed out that
    Village admitted that Greenglass performed his duties as manager of its
    properties completely and satisfactorily.  He also concluded that Greenglass’ outside activities did not interfere
    with his obligations to Village, Village was not interested in performing any
    of Greenglass’ outside activities, and Village had not suffered damages as a
    result of those outside activities.  Further, the trial judge found that Greenglass did not use his position
    with Village to obtain his outside consultant work. These findings were open to
    the trial judge on the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also found that Greenglass did not use
    any property of Village in order to make a profit.  The trial judge did note that from time to
    time Greenglass did use Village’s fax machine, computer, cell phone, and
    company car – however, we understand his finding to mean that Village’s
    property was not instrumental in Greenglass making a profit.  Moreover, it is apparent the trial judge
    regarded this use of property as minor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Village asserts for the first time on appeal that it had
    a proprietary interest in the time of Greenglass, who was Village’s full-time
    employee. However, Village acknowledges that a full-time employee can perform
    outside work in some circumstances. In this case, as noted above, Village
    admitted at trial that Greenglass performed his duties completely and
    satisfactorily.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of all these findings, which were open to the
    trial judge, we see no basis to interfere with his exercise of discretion in
    refusing to grant the remedy of disgorgement.</p>
