  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>WEILER J.A.:</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>NATURE OF THE APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Attorney General of Ontario applies for leave to
    appeal, and if leave is granted, appeals the order of the summary conviction
    appeal judge allowing the respondent Clayton Fitzsimmons’s appeal and quashing
    his conviction on the charge of driving over 80 pursuant to s. 253(b) of the
    Criminal Code. The summary conviction appeal judge also entered an acquittal
    with respect to a charge of impaired driving arising out of the same factual situation
    that had been stayed by the trial judge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown seeks to have the conviction restored and
    raises two issues. The substantive issue is whether counsel for an accused
    person, who is being detained for a breathalyser test, has the right to interrogate
    and receive answers from the breathalyser technician, prior to giving his
    client advice. The second issue concerns the difference between conditional and
    judicially imposed stays. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At approximately 10:52 p.m. on June 17, 2003, Officer
    Wyers of the Ottawa Police Service was dispatched to locate a possibly
    intoxicated driver. He was provided with a licence plate number and attended at
    the registered owner’s address. He saw a vehicle approach the address, making a
    wide turn into oncoming traffic and swerving before entering the driveway. The
    vehicle struck a decorative rock as it came to a stop. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Wyers approached the driver (Fitzsimmons) and noticed
    that his breath smelled of alcohol, he was unsteady on his feet, he had glassy
    eyes and he had slurred speech. Fitzsimmons denied having consumed any alcohol.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When asked to produce his licence, ownership, and
    insurance, Fitzsimmons searched the front of his vehicle, the glove box, and
    the trunk, before eventually locating his wallet in a golf bag. While looking
    for his licence, he almost fell on the asphalt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At 10:58 p.m. Wyers demanded a sample for an approved
    screening device. The sample registered a fail at 11:02 p.m. Wyers then
    arrested Fitzsimmons for impaired driving, read him his rights, cautioned him,
    and gave a breath demand at 11:08, 11:12, 11:14, 11:15, and 11:16 p.m.
    respectively. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>En route to the police station Fitzsimmons told Wyers
    he had consumed two beers. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Wyers and Fitzsimmons arrived at the police station at
    11:29 p.m. At 11:49 p.m., Wyers tried to contact the lawyer Fitzsimmons
    requested but had to leave a message. Fitzsimmons declined an offer to consult
    another lawyer and signed a right to counsel waiver form. Wyers handed him over
    to a qualified technician, Constable Ritchie, at 12:15 a.m.  Between 12:16 and 12:19 a.m., Ritchie
    reiterated the breath demand, cautions and right to counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At Fitzsimmons’s request, Ritchie made two more
    attempts to contact Fitzsimmons’s first choice of lawyer before reaching
    Lawrence Greenspon, his second choice, at 12:28 a.m. Greenspon asked Ritchie
    questions about the investigation, including why Fitzsimmons had been stopped
    and whether there had been an accident. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ritchie refused to discuss the investigation with him
    and told Greenspon he was not the arresting officer. Greenspon told Ritchie
    that he could not give Fitzsimmons proper advice unless he was given the
    reasons for the stop and the grounds for it. He noted Ritchie’s refusal to
    answer his questions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fitzsimmons then consulted with Greenspon over
    the phone in private until 12:36 a.m., answering Greenspon’s questions the best
    he could regarding the circumstances of the arrest. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, Fitzsimmons applied for an order pursuant to
    s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i> excluding all evidence obtained from him
    following alleged breaches of his ss. 7 and 10(b) rights: 1) the failure of the
    police to facilitate Fitzsimmons’s right to retain and instruct counsel by not
    assisting Greenspon; 2) the failure to cease questioning Fitzsimmons until
    after he had an opportunity to consult counsel of his choice; 3) the failure of
    the police to advise Fitzsimmons of their duty to hold off questioning. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Greenspon testified that his advice to
    Fitzsimmons was based on what Fitzsimmons told him, as opposed to information
    Greenspon wished to obtain about what was in the mind of the arresting
    officer.  Greenspon also said the time of
    the incident was important to the advice he had to give and that he had not
    been given this information by the police. Fitzsimmons testified at trial that
    he could not recall Greenspon asking him about the time or how long he had been
    at the police station. Greenspon confirmed he did not ask Fitzsimmons the time
    of the incident. Greenspon’s evidence was that the detainee’s evidence in this
    regard is often unreliable. <span style='font-size:14.0pt'>In the result, </span>Fitzsimmons
    testified that he did not feel that he had received complete advice from
    Greenspon, especially on the question of whether or not he had to give a breath
    sample.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge denied the applications, holding
    that Ritchie was not obliged to answer counsel’s questions before speaking to
    Fitzsimmons and that Fitzsimmons had failed to establish on a balance of
    probabilities that his rights were violated. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the evidence was deemed admissible, the defence
    called no evidence, at which time the trial judge convicted Fitzsimmons of
    driving over 80 but stayed the impaired driving charge on the grounds that he
    could not find him guilty of both offences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On Summary Conviction Appeal, the summary conviction
    appeal judge concluded that the information sought from Ritchie by Greenspon
    did not impose an onerous burden and the decision to withhold the information
    unduly limited Fitzsimmons’s right to counsel. She ordered a new trial. With
    regard to the impaired driving charge, the summary conviction appeal judge held
    that the trial judge had never found Fitzsimmons guilty of that charge and that
    the trial judge therefore did not have jurisdiction to impose a conditional
    stay. The summary conviction appeal judge concluded that the judicial stay of
    proceedings amounted to an acquittal and she declined to remit the stayed
    charge back for a new trial.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Upon arrest the police have an obligation to provide
    the detainee with the reason for his arrest, advise him of the right to
    counsel, and to provide him with an opportunity to exercise that right.  In this case, instead of consulting with his
    client, counsel for the detainee insisted on speaking to the breathalyser
    technician first and the technician’s refusal to answer counsel’s questions
    formed the basis of the alleged infringement of Fitzsimmons <i>Charter</i> rights.  Further, although counsel claimed that he
    needed the information from the breathalyser technician in order to properly
    advise his client, he did not seek to obtain this same information from his
    client.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel’s obligation was to first consult with his
    client, the detainee, and to ask him what he needed to know in order to advise
    him.  This he did not do.  In <i>R.
    v. Stenset </i>(1999), 135 C.C.C. (3d) 112 (Alta.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) a decision with which we
    agree, the court stated at paras. 10-13:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Counsel for the accused appellant postulates that a
    lawyer consulted has a broad right to question the constable who telephones
    about all the grounds which the constable thinks give him reasonable and
    probable grounds to demand a breath sample.  As he argued it, such right would not be conditional upon any lack of
    knowledge [by the client].  Nor would it
    be confined to a recital of specific facts.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There is no such evidence here [that the appellant
    driver lacked any relevant information or that he was incapable of telling his
    lawyer what he knew] so I need not reach a conclusion on the law applicable in
    such different fact situations.  But it
    is at least arguable that the police have no duty to tell the lawyer what he
    already knows, nor what he could easily learn by simply asking the driver who
    is consulting him.  For example, suppose
    that a driver knows that he has been drinking very recently, has driven thereafter,
    has blown into a roadside breath test device operated by the police, and that
    the machine has registered a “fail”.  And
    suppose that he knows (as did this appellant) that he is being arrested for
    impaired driving.  Then it is highly
    likely that there are reasonable and probable grounds to demand a breath
    sample, given that case law.  (The chance
    that the police were using a type of roadside device then not approved seems
    remote.) A lawyer experienced in this area, like the one in question here, could
    see a picture from a few of these facts, all known to the driver phoning
    him.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Under those circumstances, it seems to me that it
    is arguable that trying to learn whether the constable had any additional
    grounds (such as inability to walk straight) is not necessary to give advice
    whether to blow into the machine.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Having an early, test cross-examination of the
    constable may be useful for the lawyer’s later conduct of the defence at trial
    (or preliminary inquiry).  But that is
    not the purpose of consulting counsel on the scene before charges are laid in
    respect of the breathalyser, indeed before the driver decides whether to blow
    into it or not.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Alberta Court of Appeal disapproved of the decision
    in <i>R. v. Sherwood </i>(1991), 29 M.V.R.
    (2d) 21 (B.C.S.C.), on which the respondent relies, on the basis that that
    decision did not consider whether the lawyer had, or could have gotten, the
    facts another way and relied on cases where the right to counsel had been
    denied. <i>R. v. Stenset </i>further held,
    at paras. 17-18, that while the questions asked by counsel concerning the
    grounds of arrest might appear at first blush to be factual questions, in
    reality they were questions of mixed fact and law.  By analogy to cases where someone questioned
    by the police need only be told in broad and general terms of the charge, not
    the precise charge, still less the precise facts, the Court concluded there had
    been no violation of the accused appellant’s rights.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the case before us, the summary conviction appeal
    judge purported to distinguish <i>Stenset,</i> on the basis that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The facts at trial do not establish that Mr.
    Fitzsimmons possessed all the necessary facts to permit Mr. Greenspon to assess
    whether [the] police had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a breath
    sample.  Further, the facts at trial do
    not establish that Mr. Greenspon turned to Constable Ritchie for assistance
    interpretation of a ‘compendious question of mixed law and fact’.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree with the summary conviction appeal judge’s
    conclusion that Greenspon was not seeking information involving an issue of
    mixed fact and law when asking questions of Ritchie concerning the grounds of
    arrest or that <i>Stenset </i>was
    distinguishable on that basis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  <span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>The summary conviction appeal judge further erred by
    placing a burden of proof on the Crown when s</span>he concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It cannot and should not be assumed, without the
    proper factual foundation, that Mr. Fitzsimmons had all of the information
    required by legal counsel to provide him with the necessary advice.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> T<span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>he burden was not on the Crown. It was on Fitzsimmons
    to prove on a balance of probabilities that he had not been able to exercise
    his s. 10(b) rights in a meaningful manner.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>The fundamental purpose
    of s. 10(b) is to ensure that detainees are sufficiently informed of their
    jeopardy and their right to counsel and are given a reasonable opportunity to
    exercise that right. </span>Ritchie was under no obligation to answer
    Greenspon’s questions before Greenspon spoke to Fitzsimmons. Indeed to place
    such an obligation on a breathalyser operator is impractical and could seriously
    interfere with the officer’s ability to carry out his duties not only with
    respect to this detainee but others as well.  We are not satisfied that there was any information necessary to the
    giving of legal advice that counsel could not have obtained by other means such
    as by asking his client.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances we need not address the question
    of whether s. 10(b) gives rise to any obligation on the part of the police to
    provide to counsel with information that counsel cannot obtain from the detainee.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In view of our disposition on the substantive ground of
    appeal, we need not address the issue of the stay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons given, leave to appeal is granted, the
    appeal is allowed, the order of the summary conviction appeal judge is set
    aside and the conviction on the count of driving over 80 is restored.  </p>
