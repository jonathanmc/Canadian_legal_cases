    dispute between two groups of creditors of an insolvent company, Ivaco Inc.,
    and its related group of companies.  The
    dispute is over the sale proceeds of the assets of Ivaco.  On one side of the dispute are the employees
    and retirees in Ivaco’s underfunded non-union pension plans.  They claim under the deemed trust and lien
    provisions of Ontario’s<i> Pension Benefits Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.8, ss.
    57(3), (4) (“PBA”), and seek to recover unpaid contributions to the plans
    outside of bankruptcy.  On the other
    side of the dispute are Ivaco’s financial and trade creditors.  They wish to put Ivaco into bankruptcy in
    order to take advantage of the scheme of distribution under the federal<i> Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3<i> </i>(“BIA”).  The dispute arises because provincial deemed
    trusts do not, by virtue of that legislative designation, enjoy priority under
    the federal bankruptcy statute.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ivaco and its related group of
    companies (collectively “the Companies”) became insolvent in 2003.  In September 2003, the Companies sought and
    obtained court-ordered protection under the <i>Companies’ Creditors Arrangement
    Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36 (“CCAA”).  All claims of creditors were stayed.  A later order stayed the Companies’ obligation to pay the outstanding
    past service contributions and special payments to the non-union pension
    plans.  (Past service contributions are
    monies due to fund benefits or benefit enhancements for pension members’ past
    service; special payments are extraordinary payments made because a pension
    plan is underfunded).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The main purpose of CCAA proceedings
    is to facilitate the restructuring of an insolvent company so that it may stay
    in business.  The Companies, however,
    were unable to restructure.  In late
    2004, virtually all of their assets were sold.  All that remains is a pool of money: the proceeds of sale.  All that remains to be done is to distribute
    this pool of money among the creditors.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Superintendent of Financial
    Services, representing the employees and retirees, brought a motion for an
    order that part of the sale proceeds be used to satisfy the unpaid past service
    and special contributions, which the Companies are deemed to hold in trust for
    the beneficiaries of the pension plans under the PBA.  Alternatively, the Superintendent sought an order segregating
    this amount in a separate account.  The
    Quebec Pension Committee (“QPC”), the administrator of the largest non-union
    plan, supported the Superintendent’s motion.  Two of the Companies’ lenders, the Bank of Nova Scotia and the National
    Bank, brought motions for an order lifting the stay under the CCAA and
    petitioning the Companies into bankruptcy.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

    CCAA proceedings for over two and a half years, heard all three motions.  By order dated July 18, 2005 he dismissed
    the Superintendent’s motion and partly granted the banks’ motions.  He lifted the stay and permitted the
    bankruptcy petitions to proceed, but he did not put the Companies into
    bankruptcy. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

    either in law or in the exercise of his discretion.  The Superintendent submits that the motions judge erred in law by
    failing to order immediate payment of the amount of the deemed trusts or in
    failing to segregate this amount.  The
    Superintendent contends that the PBA legally required that the deemed trusts
    for unpaid past service contributions and special payments be executed or
    protected before bankruptcy.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Alternatively, the Superintendent
    submits that the motions judge erred by exercising his discretion to lift the
    stay under the CCAA and permit the bankruptcy petitions to proceed without
    first protecting the claims of the pension beneficiaries.  The Superintendent contends that the motions
    judge exercised his discretion on a wrong principle because he ignored the
    unfairness and prejudice to the Companies’ most vulnerable creditors. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Superintendent also appeals an
    ancillary order made by the motions judge.  To facilitate the bankruptcy petitions, the motions judge ordered that
    the head offices of two of the Companies be transferred from cities in Quebec
    to Toronto.  The Superintendent and the
    QPC submit that the motions judge had no jurisdiction under the CCAA to do so,
    or alternatively, improperly exercised his discretion in doing so.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This court granted leave to appeal
    under s. 13 of the CCAA.  The court also
    stayed the two orders in favour of the banks pending the disposition of the
    appeal.</span></p>

    Ifastgroupe Inc., Docap (1985) Corporation, Florida Sub One Holdings Inc. and
    3632610 Canada Inc.  Four of these
    corporations – Ivaco, IRM, Ifastgroupe and Docap – established the non-union
    pension plans in issue on this appeal.  </span></p>

    non-unionized workforce.  They
    established various registered pension plans for their employees.  These included four non-union plans: the
    Ivaco Salaried Plan, which is registered in Quebec and has both Quebec and
    Ontario members, the Designated Employees Plan, the Ingersoll Plan and the
    Docap Plan, all registered in Ontario.</span></p>

    financially troubled, the Companies sought and were granted protection from
    their creditors under the CCAA.  On
    September 16, the motions judge granted a comprehensive stay of all creditor
    claims up to that time.  He appointed
    Ernst &amp; Young Inc. as Monitor.  As a
    result of the stay, debts of the Companies existing on the date of the initial
    stay order have not been paid.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When the Companies began CCAA proceedings,
    the non-union pension plans were underfunded.  Before the initial stay order the Companies had been making both special
    payments and past services contributions to rectify this underfunding.  Under the PBA, past service contributions
    accrue daily and are to be paid monthly.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Early in the CCAA proceedings, the
    Monitor concluded that the Companies would jeopardize their ability to
    restructure if they were required to continue making past service contributions
    and special payments.  Because of the
    magnitude of these payments, the creditors would not agree to permit the DIP
    (debtor in possession) loan to be used for funding the pension plans.  In their view, and in the view of the
    Monitor, doing so would imperil the possibility of restructuring.  Relying on the Monitor’s opinion, the
    Companies sought, and on November 28, 2003, were granted a pension stay order.</span></p>

    Companies from making past service contributions or special payments to the
    underfunded non-union pension plans during the CCAA stay.  No interested party, including both the
    Superintendent and the QPC, opposed the order.  All parties thought that relieving the Companies from making these payments
    would assist their restructuring efforts.  The Companies still remained obligated to make current contributions to
    the non-union plans.  </span></p>

    restructure, they began to pursue a second option: selling their assets in a
    going concern sale.  On August 18, 2004,
    the motions judge approved the sale of the assets of Ivaco, Ifastgroupe and IRM
    to the Heico Companies.  As part of the
    transaction, the purchaser hired the Companies’ unionized workforce and assumed
    the Companies’ obligations to their unionized pension plans.  The purchaser also hired almost all of the
    Companies’ non-unionized workforce, but it was unwilling to assume the
    Companies’ obligations to the four non-union pension plans.  These obligations remained with the
    Companies.</span></p>

    sale.  In the Monitor’s view, the sale
    gave the creditors and workers greater recovery and benefits than they would

    opposed the sale. </span></p>

    year.  These pensioners will receive
    their full pension only if the full wind-up deficit is paid. For example, if

    the parties that do not need to be decided on this appeal: (1) whether, outside
    of bankruptcy, the deemed trusts under the PBA have priority over the Bank of

    (2) whether the Superintendent can show “sufficient cause” under s. 43(7) of
    the BIA to deny the application for a bankruptcy order; and, (3) whether the
    deemed trusts under the PBA also meet the requirements for a common law trust
    and thus on bankruptcy should be excluded from the property of the Companies

lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On my view of the appeal, the first of
    these issues does not have to be resolved.  It may become relevant at the bankruptcy hearing, and, if so, should be
    dealt with by the bankruptcy judge.  See <i>Abraham v. Canadian Admiral Corp. (Receiver of)</i> (1998), 39 O.R. (3d) 176
    (C.A.).  The second and third issues, I
    assume, will be dealt with at the hearing of the bankruptcy petitions.  Admittedly, the motions judge made some
    observations on these two issues.  However, he also said, at para. 20 of his reasons, that he was not
    deciding either one:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>However, in the
    circumstances, I do not find it appropriate to allow (indeed direct) that there
    be an assignment in bankruptcy on a “voluntary basis” as there is the s. 43(7)
    issue to be determined.  Similarly with
    respect to the balance of declarations requested by the National Bank, while I
    have made some general observations as to reversing priorities, it would not be
    appropriate to determine with finality the priorities of various claims on the
    record before me at this time.</p>

lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In their written and oral submissions,
    the Superintendent and the QPC argued that some of the motions judge’s general
    observations on these issues were wrong.  I do not propose to consider these arguments because, as the motions
    judge recognized, they should be addressed at the hearing of the bankruptcy
    petitions.  Instead, I will make a
    few  brief observations of my own.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the motions judge
    appropriately considered what would likely happen at the bankruptcy
    hearing.  He did so because the likely
    implications of lifting the stay were relevant considerations to the exercise
    of his discretion.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motions judge observed, at para.
    14,  that the discretion to refuse to
    make a bankruptcy order under s. 43(7) typically is exercised in two categories
    of cases: where the petitioner has an ulterior motive in seeking the order, or
    where the order would not serve any meaningful purpose.  This observation reflects the current state
    of the case law under s. 43(7).  See for
    example <i>Re Dallas/North Group Inc.</i> (1999), 46 O.R. (3d) 602 (Gen. Div.); <i>Buth-na-bodhiaga, Inc. v. Lambert</i> (2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 787 (C.A.).  Although the motions judge added that the
    Superintendent’s claim does not appear to come within either category, he left
    the final determination of that question for the bankruptcy judge.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motions judge also observed, at
    para. 11 of his reasons, that a provincially created deemed trust does not by
    that fact alone enjoy priority under the BIA.  This is not a contentious proposition.  In a series of cases, the Supreme Court of Canada has repeatedly said
    that a province cannot, by legislating a deemed trust, alter the scheme of
    priorities under the federal statute.  See for example <i>British Columbia v. Henfrey Samson Belair Ltd.</i>,
    [1989] 2 S.C.R. 24; <i>Husky Oil Operations Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, </i>[1995] 3 S.C.R. 453.  Indeed, it is
    this jurisprudence that undoubtedly prompted the Superintendent’s original
    motion and appeal to this court.</span></p>

    observed, at para. 11 of his reasons, that a provincial deemed trust will
    retained its priority in bankruptcy only if it also meets the three attributes
    – the three certainties – of a common law trust: certainty of intent; certainty
    of subject matter; and certainty of object.  Only a trust that has these three attributes is a “true trust” that will
    be exempt from the bankrupt’s estate under s. 67(1)(a) of the BIA.  See for example <i>Henfrey Sampson</i>,<i> supra</i>.  Whether the Superintendent
    can establish a true trust for unpaid past service contributions, even though
    the proceeds of the Heico sale have been commingled, will be decided at the
    bankruptcy hearing.</span></p>

    submission is that the motions judge erred in law in failing to order payment
    of the amount of the deemed trusts before bankruptcy or in failing to order the
    Monitor to segregate this amount during the CCAA proceedings.  The submission that the motions judge was
    legally required to order payment or segregation of the amount of the deemed
    trusts was not advanced before him.  The
    Superintendent advanced this submission for the first time in this court.  I do not agree with it.  </span></p>

    motions judge should have required the Monitor, Ernst &amp; Young, to segregate
    the amount of the deemed trusts.  The
    Superintendent contends that the Companies, and in their place the Monitor, had
    a statutory and fiduciary obligation to segregate.  As the Monitor was an officer of the court, the motions judge
    should have compelled it to fulfill these duties.  This contention faces three obstacles: the language of the PBA;
    the terms of the pension stay order; and the status and role of the Monitor.</span></p>

    provision that creates a deemed trust for unpaid employer contributions.  Subsection (4) stipulates that on the wind
    up of a pension plan, employer contributions accrued but not yet due because of
    the timing of the wind up are also deemed to be held in trust:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>s. 57(3) An employer

    motions judge said that both unpaid contributions and wind-up liabilities are
    deemed to be held in trust under s. 57(3).  In his earlier decision in <i>Toronto-Dominion Bank v. Usarco</i> (1991), 42 E.T.R 235, Farley J. said, at para. 25, that the equivalent
    legislation then in force under the <i>Pension Benefits Act</i>, <i>1987</i>,
    S.O. 1987, c.35 referred only to unpaid contributions, not to wind-up
    liabilities.  I think that the statement

    provisions required the Companies, and in their place the Monitor, to keep the
    unpaid contributions in a separate account.  However, the language of s. 57 does not require the employer to hold the
    contributions separately.  A “deemed
    trust” is, in a sense, a legal fiction.  Outside of bankruptcy it does create a priority for pension
    contributions, a priority that would not exist but for the designation.  Yet, as I have already said, this
    legislative designation by itself does not create a true trust.  If the province wants to require an employer
    to keep its unpaid contributions to a pension plan in a separate account it
    must legislate that separation.  It has
    not done so.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Superintendent argues that the
    pension stay order supports her position because para. 5 the order, <i>supra</i>,
    recognized that a deemed trust for unpaid contributions may arise during the
    stay period and that para. 6 of the stay order, <i>supra</i>, did not
    compromise the Companies’ obligation to make these contributions.  This argument fails to take account of para.
    4 of the pension stay order.  Paragraph
    4 stipulates that during the stay the Companies will not incur any obligation –
    statutory, fiduciary or otherwise – for failing to make contributions to the
    plan.  In my view, the Superintendent’s
    argument amounts to an impermissible collateral attack on para. 4 of the
    pension stay order.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Monitor was appointed under s.
    11.7(1) of the CCAA to “monitor the business and financial affairs” of the
    Companies, and was given the functions set out in s. 11.7(3) of that statute:
    to examine the Companies’ property, report to the court on the Companies’
    business and financial affairs and keep the creditors informed.  Although the motions judge gave the Monitor
    additional powers, they were limited.  The Monitor was given authority to deal with day-to-day administrative
    matters, to finalize the sale to Heico and to receive and control the proceeds
    of sale.  I do not think it can be
    fairly said that the Monitor “stands in the shoes of the Companies”. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Equally important, the Monitor does
    not owe a fiduciary duty to the pension beneficiaries.  The Superintendent’s attempt to impose an
    obligation on the Monitor to segregate the contributions to the non-union plans
    depends at least on establishing that the Monitor acts as a fiduciary of the
    employees in those plans.  Both the role
    of the Monitor and the initial stay order preclude the Superintendent’s
    assertion.</span></p>

    E.E. Gillese, <i>The Fiduciary Liability of the Employer as Pension Plan
    Administrator</i> (Toronto: The Canadian Institute, November 18, 1996, pp.
    1-25).   But the Monitor was not given
    that role.  It is not an administrator
    of any of the four non-union plans.  Indeed, the Superintendent never asked the court to give the Monitor
    responsibility for administering these plans.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Moreover, para. 59 of the initial stay
    order expressly states that the Monitor is not to be considered either a
    successor or related employer.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THIS COURT ORDERS that
    nothing in this Order shall result in the Monitor being or being deemed or

    two cases, the decision of this court in <i>GMAC Commercial Credit Corp. -

    the <i>Truck Transportation Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. T.-22) to hold carriers’

    require an employer to keep its unpaid contributions in a separate trust
    account.  Moreover, in <i>TCT Logistics, </i>despite s. 15(2) of the Regulation, this court held that the carrier fees

    obligation”.  These comments do not
    apply to this case.  The Monitor here,

    agreement, I doubt that the CCAA even authorized the motions judge to order
    this payment.  Once restructuring was
    not possible and the CCAA proceedings were spent, as the motions judge found
    and all parties acknowledged, I question whether the court had any authority to
    order a distribution of the sale proceeds.  See for example <i>Re United Maritimes Fisheries Cooperative</i> (1988),

    the CCAA and the BIA.  The two statutes
    are related.  A debtor company under the
    CCAA is defined in s. 2 by the company’s bankruptcy or insolvency.  Section 11(3) authorizes a thirty-day stay
    of any current or prospective proceedings under the BIA, and s. 11(4)
    authorizes an extension of the initial thirty-day period.  During the stay period, creditor claims and
    bankruptcy proceedings are suspended.  Once the stay is lifted by court order or terminates by its own terms,
    simultaneously the creditor claims and bankruptcy proceedings are revived and
    may go forward.  </span></p>

    be correct, there would have to be a gap between the end of the CCAA period and
    bankruptcy proceedings, in which the pension beneficiaries’ rights under the
    deemed trusts crystallize before the rights of all other creditors, including
    their right to bring a bankruptcy petition.  That position is illogical.  All
    rights must crystallize simultaneously at the end of the CCAA period.  There is simply no gap in the federal
    insolvency regime in which the provincial deemed trusts alone can operate.  That is obviously so on the facts in this case
    because the Bank of Nova Scotia had already commenced a petition for
    bankruptcy, which was stayed by the initial order under the CCAA.  Once the motions judge lifted the stay, the
    petition was revived.  In my view,

    and interrelated scheme for dealing with the property of insolvent companies, a
    scheme that occupies the field and ousts the application of provincial
    legislation.  Were it otherwise, creditors
    might be tempted to forgo efforts to restructure a debtor company and instead
    put the company immediately into bankruptcy.  That would not be a desirable result.  </span></p>

    so indirectly.  See <i>Husky Oil, supra,</i> at paras. 32 and 39.  At bottom the

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the end result I do
    not see that the Superintendent has made a compelling case to the effect that

    course.  I have reached that conclusion
    by weighing the factors pro and con as discussed above, including the relative
    benefits to all stakeholders (including workers and pensioners) to maintaining
    the CCAA proceedings (with the benefit of the suspension of past contributions
    as per the unopposed and un-reconsidered order of November 28, 2003), the fact
    that no reorganization is now possible as all Ivaco Companies (except Docap)
    have ceased operations and are without operational assets and that the Ivaco
    Companies are now essentially in a distribution of proceeds mode.</p>

    intervention is justified only for an error in principle or the unreasonable
    exercise of discretion.  The
    Superintendent submits that the motions judge exercised his discretion
    improperly – on a wrong principle – because he ignored the “unfair and
    prejudicial” effects of his order on the Companies’ most vulnerable class of
    creditors: the pension beneficiaries.  I
    disagree.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Superintendent argues that the
    motions judge’s order was unfair to the pension beneficiaries in three related
    ways.  First, she points out that the
    pension beneficiaries agreed to a stay of the past service contributions to
    keep the Companies afloat, which in turn permitted the going concern sale to
    Heico.  That sale greatly enhanced the
    return to the creditors.  The
    Superintendent contends that now permitting the bankruptcy petitions to
    proceed, which would potentially deprive the pension beneficiaries of their
    rights, produces an unfair outcome. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Undoubtedly, and regrettably, the
    pension beneficiaries stand to suffer from the insolvency of the
    Companies.  However, the Superintendent’s
    argument implicitly assumes that the pension beneficiaries alone made
    sacrifices to maximize the recovery for all creditors.  The motions judge rejected this assumption,
    which he said at para. 2 of his reasons, “somewhat overstates the situation”.  The motions judge accurately concluded: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[O]ther stakeholders
    (such as the financial and trade creditors) as a result of the stay also
    contributed to the financial stability of the Ivaco Companies, fragile as their
    financial situation was, by not being paid interest as such became due nor for
    pre-filing indebtedness which was due.  </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>In short, all
    creditors gave up something to permit the Companies to stay in business so that
    they could either reorganize or sell their assets in a going concern sale.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the Superintendent contends
    that the motions judge’s order undermined his earlier pension stay order, which
    had expressly preserved the pension beneficiaries’ deemed trust rights.  I do not accept this contention.  Although the pension stay order did not take
    away these deemed trust rights, it did not provide that the deemed trusts would
    be paid out of any sale proceeds.  Instead, para. 4 of the pension stay order provided that the Companies
    would not incur any obligation because of their failure to pay past service
    contributions during the stay period.  Moreover, even though the Superintendent and the QPC knew that a
    petition for bankruptcy (by the Bank of Nova Scotia) was pending when they
    agreed to the pension stay order, they did not ask that the order be
    conditional on payment of the amount of the deemed trusts when the stay was
    lifted.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The third aspect of unfairness on
    which the Superintendent relies is that the motions judge’s order fails to take
    account of the law’s “special solicitude” for pensioners.  Certainly provincial pension legislation has
    shown this solicitude.  It has
    recognized the importance of ensuring that retirees have income security.  Thus, it has legislated statutory trusts and
    liens to protect their pension claims.  But federal insolvency law has not shown the same solicitude.  It does not accord the claims of
    “sympathetic” creditors more weight than the claims of “unsympathetic”
    ones.  Subject to specified exceptions,
    the BIA aims to distribute a bankrupt debtor’s estate equitably among all of
    the estate’s creditors.  There are
    undoubtedly compelling policy reasons to protect pension rights in an
    insolvency.  But, as I have said, it is
    for Parliament, not the courts, to do so.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Therefore, I do not accept the
    Superintendent’s unfairness argument. Also, in my view, numerous considerations
    supported the motions judge’s decision to lift the stay and permit the
    bankruptcy petitions to proceed.  These
    considerations include the following:</span></p>
  <h3><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-weight:normal;'>The CCAA proceedings are spent.  There are no entities to reorganize and no further compromises can be
    negotiated between the Companies and their creditors.  There remains only a pool of money to distribute.  The BIA is the regime Parliament has chosen
    to effect this distribution.</span></h3>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The petitioning creditors have met the technical
    requirements for bankruptcy.  And their
    desire to use the BIA to alter priorities is a legitimate reason to seek a
    bankruptcy order.  See for example <i>Bank
    of Montreal v. Scott Road Enterprises Ltd.</i> (1989), 57 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>)
    623 at 627, 630-631 (B.C.C.A); <i>Re Harrop of Milton Inc.</i> (1979), 22 O.R.

  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Superintendent and the QPC agreed to the CCAA
    process.  They recognized that it
    benefitted the pension claimants.  Thus,
    they did not oppose either the pension stay order or the sale to Heico.  They did not ask to have the deemed trusts
    satisfied or an amount to satisfy them set aside, though they knew that
    bankruptcy was pending.  They likely
    recognized that if they had insisted on a segregation order, the other creditors
    may not have agreed to the sale.  It is
    now too late for the Superintendent and the QPC to ask for relief that they
    never sought during the entire CCAA process.</p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motions judge would have gone beyond his role as a
    referee in the CCAA proceedings if he had given effect to the Superintendent’s
    claim.  The Superintendent wants to jump
    ahead of all the other creditors by obtaining an extraordinary payment at the
    end of a long CCAA process.  If the
    motions judge had ordered this payment, he would have upset the ground rules
    that all stakeholders agreed to and that he supervised for over two years.</p>

lang=EN-US>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motions judge took into account
    the likely result of the Superintendent’s claims if the Companies are put into
    bankruptcy.  He recognized that
    bankruptcy would potentially reverse the priority accorded to the pension
    claims outside bankruptcy.  Nonetheless,
    having weighed all the competing considerations, he exercised his discretion to
    lift the stay and permit the bankruptcy petitions to proceed.  In my view, he exercised his discretion
    properly.  I would not give effect to

    191 of the CBCA gives the court express authority to order the transfer of the
    head office of a company that is subject to an order under the CCAA.  Thus, to make a transfer order, the court
    need not rely on its discretion under s. 11 of the CCAA. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, the jurisdiction in s. 191(2)
    is discretionary, as evidenced by the use of the word “may”.  Therefore, the remaining question on this
    ground of appeal is whether the motions judge properly exercised his discretion
    in ordering the transfer.  I think that
    he did.  </span></p>

    carried on business since the sale of their assets to Heico was completed in
    December 2004.  The Monitor holds the
    proceeds of the sales in bank accounts in Toronto.  Because of the lengthy and complex CCAA proceedings, the Ontario
    Superior Court – Commercial List is familiar with the affairs of Ivaco and
    Ifastgroupe.  Having all the issues
    common to all the Companies administered at the same time before the court
    familiar with these issues will facilitate the most efficient, consistent and
    just administration and distribution of their estates.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The QPC, in particular, objects to
    these head office transfers.  It argues
    that the motions judge’s order will enable the creditors to defeat a future
    motion to transfer to the Quebec Superior Court the question whether the
    Companies participating in the Ivaco Salaried Plan are “solidarily liable”,
    that is jointly and severely liable, under Quebec law for satisfying the
    obligation to fund the plan. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The underpinning of the QPC’s argument
    is as follows: the “solidarily liable” provision is unique to Quebec law and
    therefore should be decided by a Quebec court.  Whether the Quebec or the Ontario Superior Court presides over this
    future motion will turn on the application of the <i>forum conveniens</i> principle.  One relevant factor in
    assessing the <i>forum conveniens</i> is the residence or place of business of
    the parties.  According to the QPC,
    transferring Ivaco’s and Ifastgroupe’s head offices to Toronto will tip the
    scales in favour of the Ontario Superior Court hearing the “solidarily liable”
    motion.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It seems to me that this is a weak
    argument.  The QPC has not yet brought
    this motion.  When it does, the Ontario
    Superior Court can assess the relevant considerations affecting the appropriate
    forum.  Now, however, the motions
    judge’s transfer order just makes good sense.  He, therefore, exercised his discretion properly.  I would not give effect to this ground of
    appeal.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motions judge did not err in law
    in refusing to order the immediate payment of the amount of the deemed trusts
    under the <i>Pension Benefits Act</i> or in refusing to segregate that
    amount.  Nor did he err in exercising
    his discretion to lift the stay under the CCAA and permit the bankruptcy
    petitions to proceed.  Finally, the
    motions judge did not err in ordering that the head offices of Ivaco and
    Ifastgroupe be transferred from Quebec to Toronto.  Accordingly, I would dismiss the Superintendent’s appeal.</span></p>
