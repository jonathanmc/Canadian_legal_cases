    deceased, Derek Cameron, aged fifteen, was a close friend of the appellant’s
    brother and a friend of the appellant.  During the afternoon of March 23,
    2005, the appellant made arrangements to pick up Derek Cameron in her four-door
    Dodge Neon and then to get cigarettes.  Calem Clark was a passenger in the
    appellant’s vehicle.  Derek was wearing roller blades.  After picking up
    Derek and the cigarettes, the appellant returned to the residential street
    where Derek lived.  The posted speed limit was 40 kilometres per hour.  Derek
    got out of the car and asked the appellant to tow him down the street.  Derek
    went to the driver’s side of the vehicle while it was slowly moving and interlocked
    arms with the appellant grabbing the pillar by the driver’s window with his
    left hand.  The appellant drove down the street at approximately 50 kilometres
    per hour towing Derek at the side of her car.  Derek eventually let go and
    continued down the road while the appellant made a U-turn.  On the return
    trip on the same street but in the opposite direction, Derek grabbed the
    pillar with both hands because the appellant had bruised her arm during the
    first encounter.  The appellant accelerated, rolled down the window and yelled
    out the speed she was reaching, eventually 80 kilometres per hour.  Derek,
    apparently enjoying the thrill of the ride, yelled to the passenger: “Calem,
    look.”  Derek then fell and was run over by the vehicle.  He was taken immediately
    to the hospital where he was pronounced dead as a result of severe blunt
    force trauma to his head. </p>

    tragic death has had a devastating impact upon his family and friends.  He
    was bright, cheerful, and positive with a wide circle of friends and activities.  The
    victim impact statements filed by his parents and the evidence they offered
    at the sentencing hearing provide moving and poignant testimony of the irreparable
    loss they have suffered.</p>

    appellant was twenty years old at the time of the offence with an unblemished
    record.  She and her family had been close friends with Derek and his family.  A
    pre-sentence report provided a positive review of the appellant’s family
    background and developmental history.  The appellant has a younger brother
    and had a happy and stable childhood, although there may have been some tension
    in her relationship with her father because of the long hours he worked.  The
    appellant’s mother indicated that the appellant had a tendency to make poor
    judgment calls with her friends and that she would do anything to please
    her friends.  The report from the appellant’s psychologist suggested that
    these past transgressions were within the range of normal adolescent behaviour
    and that any lack of judgment would improve with age and experience.  The
    appellant had no other history of behavioural problems and took school and
    work seriously.  She graduated from secondary school in 2004.  At the time
    of sentencing she was enrolled in a two-year Human Services Counsellor program
    at Durham College.  Since graduating from high school, she had consistently
    maintained employment.  At the time of sentencing she was working part time
    as a customer service associate at Home Sense where she had received three
    awards for outstanding service.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his reasons for sentence, the sentencing judge described the appellant in
    the following terms:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Tonya Kutsukake
    by all accounts is a typical young Canadian female.  Her pre-sentence report
    reveals her upbringing to have been stable.  Her parents are hardworking
    individuals who have always tried their best to raise their two children
    while maintaining as comfortable a lifestyle as they could possibly do for
    them.…  The accused is young, intelligent and presents a good future.  She
    is presently in college and works part-time at a local retail store, the
    manager of which has assessed her performance as good to outstanding and
    speaks highly of her integrity and congeniality.  Letters confirm her good
    character.  Put succinctly there is simply no articulable reason why Tonya
    Kutsukake should find herself before this court facing this kind of charge
    and yet here she is.  Her actions have devastated the lives of the Cameron
    family as shown in the victim impact statements of Derek Cameron’s mother
    and father.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant took responsibility for her actions and pleaded guilty.  Her psychologist’s
    report indicated that, as a result of Derek’s death, the appellant had shown
    signs of acute stress disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder and that
    she was experiencing strong feelings of guilt. <ins cite="mailto:soobraa"
datetime="2006-09-20T10:29"> </ins>The appellant expressed her remorse at the
    sentencing hearing.  Moreover, the psychologist’s report, the pre-sentence
    report, and the arresting officer all indicated that the appellant was genuinely
    remorseful for her actions.  The sentencing judge found that the effects
    of the appellant’s actions
    “have been brought home to her by various means” and that “[s]he has accepted
    responsibility for what she has done and this act was a singular act of recklessness – instantly
    regretted.”</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the sentencing hearing, the appellant’s counsel submitted that a conditional
    sentence of imprisonment of two years less a day was appropriate.  Crown
    counsel submitted that the court should consider a sentence of eighteen months
    imprisonment, followed by two years probation, and a five to seven year driving
    prohibition.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge gave relatively detailed reasons for the sentence he imposed.  He
    found that the appellant “clearly knew the danger to which she was exposing
    this young man and for reasons that are only known to her, she recklessly
    chose not to maintain that level of danger but to increase it by travelling
    even faster on the second run.”  On the other hand, the sentencing judge
    was satisfied that the accused “is not dishonest and she is not physically
    aggressive” and that “[s]he poses no danger to society in her day-to-day
    dealings”.  The sentencing judge further concluded that the appellant “does
    not now and will not within the next two years pose a danger to the community.” </p>

    found that the nature of the offence, the absence of alcohol, and the “young
    age of the accused” all militated against a penitentiary term.  The sentencing
    judge determined, however, that the actions of the accused “must be sharply
    denounced to deter other like-minded people from following the same tragic
    route.”  He added: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The sentence
    must also acknowledge, in no uncertain terms, the effects that such a crime
    has on the victims.  For not only has Derek Cameron lost his life, but his
    family, friends and society generally have been altered and redirected in
    such a fashion as to cause great emotional trauma and a sense of waste for
    opportunities that now have been lost.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge gave only the following reason for concluding that a conditional
    sentence was not appropriate: “this court finds that a conditional sentence
    will not satisfy the requirements for denunciation, deterrence and the recognition
    of the effects of this crime on the victims.”</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is well established that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge is

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, I have concluded that in the tragic circumstances of this case,
    the sentencing judge erred in principle: (1) by failing to consider seriously
    whether or not a conditional sentence could satisfy the needs of denunciation
    and general deterrence; and (2) by failing to give any weight to the established
    principle that when sentencing a youthful first offender the primary objective
    should be rehabilitation and specific deterrence. </p>

line-height:normal;&quot;\[%2\:14\:0\:\]&quot; Sharpe 20060915T1515'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    will deal first with the appropriateness of a conditional sentence to satisfy
    the needs of denunciation and general deterrence.  On the findings of the
    sentencing judge, the statutory prerequisites for a conditional sentence
    are met in this case: (i) there is no minimum term of imprisonment, (ii)
    the appropriate sentence is of two years less a day or less, and (iii) the
    safety of the community would not be endangered by the offender serving her
    sentence in the community.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;&quot;\[%2\:15\:0\:\]&quot; Sharpe 20060915T1515'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the leading case of <i>R. v. Proulx</i> (2000), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.),
    the Supreme Court of Canada directed that where the statutory criteria have
    been considered, “serious” consideration must be given to determine whether
    a conditional sentence would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and
    principles of sentencing.  The Supreme Court of Canada held, at para. 114,
    that even in the presence of aggravating factors which might indicate the
    need for denunciation and deterrence, “a conditional sentence may provide
    sufficient denunciation and deterrence, even in cases in which restorative
    objectives are of diminished importance”.  Writing for the court, Lamer C.J.C.
    added at para. 100:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A conditional
    sentence can achieve both punitive and restorative objectives.  To the extent
    that both punitive and restorative objectives can be achieved in a given
    case, a conditional sentence is likely a better sanction than incarceration.  Where
    the need for punishment is particularly pressing, and there is little opportunity
    to achieve any restorative objectives, incarceration will likely be the more
    attractive sanction.  However, even where restorative objectives cannot be
    readily satisfied, a conditional sentence will be preferable to incarceration
    in cases where a conditional sentence can achieve the objectives of denunciation
    and deterrence as effectively as incarceration.  This follows from the principle
    of restraint in s. 718.2(d) and (e), which militates in favour of alternatives
    to incarceration where appropriate in the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;&quot;\[%2\:16\:0\:\]&quot; Sharpe 20060915T1515'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lamer
    C.J.C. also stated, in para. 115, that “it would be a mistake to rule out
    the possibility of a conditional sentence <i>ab initio</i> simply because
    aggravating features are present.  I repeat that each case must be considered
    individually.”  The Supreme Court of Canada specifically stated, at para.
    41, that a conditional sentence is capable of achieving the objectives of
    denunciation and deterrence, “particularly in circumstances where the offender
    is forced to take responsibility for his or her actions and make reparations
    to both the victim and the community, all the while living in the community
    under tight controls.”</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge declared that denunciation and deterrence ruled out a conditional
    sentence but he failed to explain why.  In my view, the sentencing judge
    made the very error identified by the Supreme Court, at para. 115, namely,
    he “rule[d] out the possibility of a conditional sentence <i>ab initio</i> simply
    because aggravating factors are present.”  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    turn to the second point, namely the principle established by this court
    in <i>R. v. Stein </i>(1974), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 376 (Ont. C.A.) and <i>R. v.
    Priest</i> (1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (Ont. C.A.), that the primary objectives
    in sentencing a youthful first offender are individual deterrence and rehabilitation.  A
    sentence imposed on a youthful first offender should constitute the minimum
    necessary sanction that is adequate, community-based dispositions must be
    considered, and more serious forms of punishment imposed only where necessary.  These
    principles have since been codified in ss. 718(c), 718.2(d) and 718.2(e)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  While the sentencing judge took into account
    the appellant’s age in deciding that a lengthy penitentiary sentence was
    not called for, his reasons indicate that he did not give any weight to her
    age and unblemished record when considering whether to impose a conditional
    sentence.  </p>

  <p align=left style='text-align:left'>As already mentioned, the principle adopted

    my view, the only purpose to be served by requiring the appellant to serve
    her sentence in an institution would be denunciation of the unlawful conduct.  That
    factor does not, in the circumstances of this case, outweigh the other factors
    that point to a conditional sentence.  Moreover, I am of the view that denunciation
    of the unlawful conduct can be achieved without the appellant returning to
    jail.  She has seen the inside of a prison and has served forty-one days
    in custody.  I am persuaded that an additional sentence to be served in the
    community under the conditions described below will serve as sufficient denunciation
    of her conduct, consistent with the principles established in <i>Proulx</i>, <i>supra</i>.  </p>

    that will warn others of the devastating consequences of participating in
    reckless thrill-seeking behaviour.</p>

    I would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal against the sentence of
    twelve months imprisonment.  In its place I would substitute a conditional
    sentence of eighteen months, taking into account the fact that the appellant
    has already served forty-one days in custody.  The first nine months of the
    conditional sentence are to be served in the form of house arrest, the appellant
    being permitted to leave her house only as may be required for employment,
    school, medical or legal appointments, and religious observance, and between
    the hours of 9 a.m. and 12 noon on Saturdays to attend to personal shopping

    240 hours of community service as directed by her probation officer and direct
    that, to the extent possible, a significant portion of that community service
    be in the form of speaking at schools or other like institutions about the
    dangers of her conduct.  I would not interfere with the two years probation
    or with the five year driving prohibition.</p>
