    this appeal, the parents of two young children seek to set aside an order
    that the children be made permanent wards of the Crown without access so
    that they may be placed for adoption.  Wolder J. (the trial judge) made this
    order on July 14, 2005 and Quigley J. (the appeal judge) dismissed the parents’ appeal
    on October 19, 2005.  The parents appeal from the order on the basis of procedural
    errors by the trial judge that they say deprived them, especially the mother,
    of the ability to present their case that it was in the children’s best interests
    that they remain with the parents.  The parents also argue that their trial
    counsel, who also represented them before the appeal judge, did not provide
    effective assistance.  The parents have filed fresh evidence to demonstrate
    the kind of evidence that could have been presented to the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would admit the fresh evidence, allow the appeal, and order a new hearing.  I
    reach this conclusion on the basis of the procedural errors and the fresh
    evidence.  In view of that decision, I need not deal with the issue of alleged
    ineffectiveness of counsel.  However, at the conclusion of these reasons
    I offer some suggestions for how such an issue should be addressed in future
    cases before this court.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
      FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    I have concluded that there must be a new trial, I intend to only briefly
    summarize the facts.  The two children were born in August 1999 and December
    2000 and are therefore seven and five years of age.  The mother has had difficult
    mental health issues and has been hospitalized for depression on several
    occasions.  The father, who also has some psychological issues, has had difficulty
    stepping into the principal parental role.  Thus, on two occasions<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a> the
    parents asked that the Children’s Aid Society take the children into care.  Family
    Service Workers with the CAS have had frequent contact with the family since
    2001.  The material filed by the CAS before the trial judge
    indicates that the mother has had difficulty coping with the children and,
    for example, has responded inappropriately to their behaviour by yelling.  It
    is also alleged that the mother left the youngest child crying for hours
    and inappropriately disciplined the older child.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    October 22, 2003, the CAS apprehended the children.  The apprehension was
    triggered by a call from a therapist with Halton Child &amp; Youth Services
    who had been working with the mother.  She was concerned about the impact
    on the children of the mother’s failure to attend therapy sessions.  The
    mother would only contact the therapist when she was in crisis.  Although
    the CAS and Child &amp; Youth Services had been involved with the family
    for almost two years, there had been little if any progress.  The mother’s
    mental health problems were not being dealt with and the children’s behaviour
    was deteriorating.  The therapist’s central concern is captured in a letter
    she sent to the CAS:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The most concerning
    aspect of [the mother’s] inability to sustain therapy and the chaotic environment
    they reside in is the effect that has had on both [children].  Both daughters’ behaviour
    is problematic for [the parents].  In addition, each girl presents with apparent
    lags socially, emotionally, cognitively and in expressive language.  Although
    [the parents] state they love their daughters, the current situation places
    both [children] at risk of significant developmental concerns.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    event that seems to have led the therapist to contact the CAS was a visit
    to the children’s home on October 21, 2003.  On that day, the therapist saw
    the mother yell at and spank the older child on two occasions in an attempt
    to stop her temper tantrums.  She also had concerns about the children’s
    physical environment.  She believed (mistakenly as it turned out) that a
    hole in a pipe associated with the heating system represented a health hazard.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 25, 2003, a temporary care and custody order was made in favour
    of the CAS.  The procedural concerns in this case began in February 2004.  On
    February&nbsp;17, 2004, then counsel for the parents applied for an adjournment
    of the child protection hearing because the mother had just been admitted
    to hospital and was due to start electro-convulsive therapy for treatment
    of depression the following day.  The trial judge refused the adjournment
    and ordered that the trial proceed the following week on the issue of whether
    the children were in need of protection.  If the children were found to be
    in need of protection, the trial judge would adjourn the disposition stage
    of the hearing until the mother was released from hospital.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    February 20, 2004, the parents signed an agreement that the children were
    in need of protection.  The basis of the agreement differed as between the
    two parents.  With respect to the mother, she admitted that she was unavailable
    to exercise her custodial rights due to her mental illness and had not made
    adequate provision for the children’s care and custody (<i>Child and Family
    Services Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C. 11, s. 37(2)(i)).  With respect to the
    father, he agreed that he was unable to care for the children and that the
    children were brought before the court with his consent (s. 37(2)(l)).  On
    February 23, the trial judge made a finding that the children were in need
    of protection and adjourned the disposition hearing to March 23, 2004.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    March 23, the parents signed a consent agreeing that Dr. Barry Cook would
    conduct a parental assessment.  Dr. Cook had previously dealt with the family
    and two years earlier had recommended that the children remain with the parents.  In
    the March&nbsp;23 consent the parents agreed to be bound by Dr. Cook’s recommendations.
    The CAS did not give a similar undertaking.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
    the disposition hearing was adjourned from time to time awaiting completion
    of Dr. Cook’s report.  One of the endorsements made by the trial judge for
    one of the adjournments is instructive since it foreshadows future events.  The
    trial judge wrote:  “Trial not required because parties have agreed to accept
    Dr. Cook’s recommendations in his report to be released.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Cook’s final report was not completed until November 28, 2004.  He recommended
    that the children be placed for adoption in different families.  On December
    16, 2004, the CAS, relying upon the March agreement and Dr. Cook’s report,
    brought a motion for summary judgment seeking an order that the children
    be made Crown wards without access.  The mother filed an affidavit opposing
    the motion in which she challenged several of the facts upon which Dr. Cook
    based his conclusions.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
      Summary Judgment Ruling</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge defined the issue on the summary judgment motion as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>Since the
      material in support of the motion is limited to the agreement of March
      23, 2004 and to Dr. Cook’s report dated November 28, 2004, this motion
      for summary judgment is based strictly upon the enforcement of the written
      agreement of the parties.</i>  Therefore, the only evidence through which
      the respondents could raise a triable issue is that the agreement of March
      23, 2004, upon which the applicant relies, either does not exist, or is
      no longer in force or effect or has been withdrawn or in some other way,
      either in fact or in law, is no longer binding upon the respondents, thereby
      requiring this court to deal with the issues on disposition on the merits
      by way of a formal disposition hearing.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge reviewed the mother’s affidavit and concluded that it did not “raise
    any triable issue on the questions of whether this court should enforce that
    agreement by making an order of Crown wardship as requested by the applicant”.  Significantly,
    however, the trial judge held that “if the motion for summary judgment had
    been based on whether the evidence, as a whole, including the report of Dr.
    Cook of December 9, 2004, [sic] supports an order for summary judgment for
    Crown wardship without access, then the issues raised by [the mother] in
    her affidavit challenging the factual underpinning of Dr. Cook’s report and
    hence his conclusions, would raise a triable issue”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge went on to hold that he must consider whether there had been
    compliance with the Act.  He found that since the father had obviously withdrawn
    his consent to the finding that the children were in need of protection he
    was prevented from making an order for Crown wardship without access against
    the father.  However, the finding that the children were in need of protection
    with respect to the mother did not depend on her continuing consent.  In
    view of her agreement to be bound by Dr.&nbsp;Cook’s recommendations, the
    summary judgment motion succeeded against the mother.  The trial judge directed
    a trial to give the father the opportunity to persuade the court that the
    best interests of the children required them to remain in his care and custody,
    pursuant to his plan of care, which might or might not define a role for
    the mother.</p>

line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, Dr. Cook testified on behalf of the CAS.  The father was the only
    witness to testify on his behalf.  His plan of care depended on the mother,
    but the trial judge had already made a finding that the mother was unable
    to parent the children for the reasons set out in his ruling on the summary
    judgment motion.  The trial judge found that the children were still in need
    of protection and that the father had been unable to present a viable plan
    that would allow him, in the absence of the mother, to parent the children
    effectively and to meet their challenging needs. The father could not parent
    the children effectively since his work schedule did not allow him to be
    available for the children at all times.  The trial judge also found that
    the children were still in need of protection as against the mother.  Accordingly,
    he made an order for Crown wardship without access to permit adoption of
    the children.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the appeal to the Superior Court of Justice, counsel for the appellants (the
    same counsel as at trial) alleged that the trial judge had failed to apply
    the best interests test, to properly consider the father’s proposed plan
    of care, and to take into account the mother’s progress with respect to her
    mental health.  The appeal judge carefully considered the issues that were
    raised before him.  On the record before him, he properly disposed of the
    grounds of appeal that were raised by the appellants.  Counsel did not attempt
    to introduce any fresh evidence and the grounds of appeal that were argued
    in this court concerning the summary judgment motion and related procedural
    issues were not raised.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the CAS, quite fairly, did not suggest that the failure to raise the
    summary judgment and related issues in the Superior Court of Justice precluded
    counsel from relying on those points before this court.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants challenge the trial judge’s jurisdiction to entertain a summary
    judgment motion once the trial had commenced.  They submit that the trial
    commenced on February 23.  I need not decide that issue since I am of the
    view that, even if there was jurisdiction to grant summary judgment, the
    process followed was fundamentally flawed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the trial judge misconceived the issue at the summary judgment motion
    and this led him to delegate the disposition decision, as it related to the
    mother, to Dr. Cook.  I have set out the manner in which the trial judge
    framed the issue.  In effect, he held that, in order to raise a triable issue,
    the parents had to show that they were no longer bound by the agreement of
    March 23.  If they could not do so, there was no need for the “court to deal
    with the issues on disposition on the merits by way of a formal disposition
    hearing”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are several problems with this approach.  First, the burden was not on the
    parents to show that there was a triable issue.  The burden was on the CAS,
    the moving party, to show that there was no triable issue. See <i>F.B. v.
    S.G.</i> (2001), 199 D.L.R. (4th) 554 (Ont. S.C.J.) at paras. 24 - 28; <i>Children’s
    Aid Society of Toronto v. K.T.</i>, [2000] O.J. No. 4736 (Ct. J.) at para.
    10; <i>Guarantee Co. of North America v. Gordon Capital Corp.</i>, [1999]
    3 S.C.R. 423 at para. 27.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the trial judge allowed the material filed by the CAS to determine the issue
    at the summary judgment motion.  For convenience, I repeat the opening sentence
    of the paragraph where the trial judge defined the issue:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Since the material
    in support of the motion is limited to the agreement of March 23, 2004 and
    to Dr. Cook’s report dated November 28, 2004, this motion for summary judgment
    is based strictly upon the enforcement of the written agreement of the parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    moving party cannot define the issues on a motion for summary judgment simply
    by the material it files in support of the motion.  The written agreement
    may have been a piece of evidence upon which the CAS could rely, but that
    was not the issue on the summary judgment motion.  In its notice of motion,
    the CAS sought:  “An Order that the children … shall be made Wards of the
    Crown, without access, and shall be placed in the care and custody of the
    Children’s Aid Society, Region of Halton.”<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[3]</span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    the issue was not simply whether the parents were bound by the March 23 agreement,
    but whether there were triable issues respecting the application for an order
    of Crown wardship with no access.  That was the order the CAS sought in its
    motion, and the trial judge recognized that there were triable issues on
    that question:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>On the other
    hand, if the motion for summary judgment had been based on whether the evidence,
    as a whole, including the report of Dr. Cook of December 9, 2004 [sic] supports
    an order for summary judgment for Crown wardship without access, then the
    issues raised by [the mother] in her affidavit challenging the factual underpinning
    of Dr. Cook’s report and hence his conclusions, would raise a triable issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    limiting the issue, at least as it applied to the mother, to the agreement
    of March 23, the trial judge improperly delegated his jurisdiction to determine
    the disposition to the parties and Dr. Cook.  He did not apply the criteria
    he was mandated to apply under the Act.  As the above excerpt shows, the
    trial judge did not even examine the substance of Dr. Cook’s report, but
    simply accepted his conclusions regarding the mother because of the agreement.  As
    the CAS concedes, irrespective of the position taken by the parents, the
    trial judge was obligated to satisfy himself on the evidence that Crown wardship
    was in the best interests of the children. See <i>Children’s Aid Society
    of Hamilton-Wentworth v. B. (K.)</i> (2002),
    16 O.F.L.R. 113 (S.C.J.); <i>M. (A.C.) v. M. (D.)</i> (2003), 67 O.R. (3d)

    though the trial judge went on to hold a disposition hearing as it applied
    to the father, the procedural error continued to affect the proceedings.  The
    trial judge found that the father’s parenting plan was not viable because
    it involved the mother and he had already determined the disposition issue
    against the mother on the summary judgment motion.  However, as noted above,
    he did not make this determination on the merits.  Rather, the trial judge
    delegated that decision to Dr. Cook, even though he recognized that in her
    affidavit the mother had raised a triable issue on that issue.</p>

    would make one last comment on this aspect of the appeal.  I am mindful of
    the huge caseload facing the trial courts of this province in respect of
    child protection matters.  Thus, nothing said here should be taken as an
    attempt to limit the courts’ attempts to expedite these difficult cases in
    appropriate circumstances.  However, I adopt the comments of Himel J. in <i>F.B.
    v. S.G., supra. </i> In that case, Justice Himel outlined the history of
    the use of summary judgment in child protection motions culminating in the
    enactment of Rule 16 of the <i>Family Court Rules</i>.  I agree with her
    that this jurisdiction must be exercised with caution.  As Himel J. wrote
    at para. 23,  “Considering the jurisprudence both before and since the enactment
    of Rule 16, it is clear that it remains appropriate that summary judgment
    jurisdiction be exercised cautiously since that is consistent with the principles
    of justice and the best interests of children.” Further, Himel&nbsp;J. wrote
    at para. 40: “Effective parental participation at the child protection hearing
    is essential to determine the best interests of the child in circumstances
    where the parent seeks to maintain custody of the child.”  </p>

    the manner in which the trial judge in this case exercised the summary judgment

    as to whether Crown wardship was in the best interests of the children.</p>

    light of the error respecting summary judgment, it becomes necessary to consider
    the appropriate disposition of this appeal.  Because the mother was eliminated
    from the trial on the merits, the trial record is incomplete.  It is therefore
    appropriate to consider the fresh evidence proffered by counsel for the appellants
    in this appeal.  As the Supreme Court of Canada held in <i>Catholic Children's
    Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto v. M. (C.)</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 165 at
    166 - 167:  “Although it might be more in line with usual procedures for
    a court of appeal to base its conclusions on the evidence before the trial
    judge, the particular nature of appeals in child welfare legislation requires
    a sufficiently flexible rule where an accurate assessment of the present
    situation of the parties and the children, in particular, is of crucial importance.”</p>

    to them.  While Ms.&nbsp;Tanner concedes that she has never met the children,
    she did watch many hours of videotapes that the parents made of their supervised

    the mother missed and kept.  That list shows that the mother missed many
    appointments.  Mr.&nbsp;Kennedy explained that when the mother missed appointments
    she would sometimes call and reschedule.  On some occasions she was hospitalized
    and missed appointments for that reason.  Sometimes she came in on the wrong
    day. And, sometimes, she was in a great deal of distress and simply forgot.
    Mr. Kennedy would then call and follow up with her.  On some occasions, the

    letter to which I will refer later. Although a general practitioner, Dr.
    Esmond has had extensive training and experience in managing mental illness.
    He does both supportive therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy and he
    has counselled the mother for many years. Dr.&nbsp;Esmond was also the father’s

    report was rebutted by Dr. Cook’s evidence and held that he could “give no
    weight to Dr. Esmond’s report”, in part, because it contained a serious error.
    Namely, the report stated that the mother’s depression had been under control
    since November 2003 and made no mention of her hospitalization in 2004. These
    statements were contradicted by the father’s own evidence.</p>

    “failed to demonstrate that Dr. John Esmond has the expertise to allow him
    to opine that he sees no medical reason why [the mother] cannot take care
    of the children on her own on account of her posing no danger to herself
    or anybody else at this point in time”. As I have indicated, it appears that
    in fact Dr. Esmond has considerable expertise in dealing with mental illness.</p>

    parental role for these children”. With respect to the mother, Dr. Esmond
    explains how a change in medication for her in early 2004 was “in hindsight”,
    a tragically mistaken step”. This change, together with some external issues,
    led to a flare-up of her depression. Once the medication was corrected, the
    mother’s condition stabilized. Dr. Esmond also explains the reasons for the
    mother’s hospitalization in 2004. With respect to the father, Dr.&nbsp;Esmond
    has no concerns about his mental health. He disagrees with Dr. Cook’s suggestion
    that the father was a suicide risk. Further, he has no concern that the children
    were being abused and, in the past, he found the parents to be attentive
    to the health care needs of the children.</p>

    motion, the mother’s personal circumstances were not properly developed.  She
    was denied the opportunity to effectively participate in the process that
    led to the order.  The evidence from Dr. Esmond, Mr. Kennedy and Dr. McHugh
    suggests that the mother’s mental illness is not nearly as debilitating as
    was portrayed at the trial and that with proper support she may be able to
    adequately parent these children.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Admittedly,
    some of the “fresh” evidence was available at the trial.  For reasons that
    are not fully explained in the record before me the father did not call this
    evidence.  The parents allege that they did not receive effective assistance
    from their trial counsel and that explains the failure to call some of the
    evidence.  I deal briefly with that allegation below.  Suffice to say that
    the due diligence criterion for admissibility of fresh evidence will yield
    where its rigid application might lead to a miscarriage of justice.  It is
    my view that to exclude this evidence, given the distorting effect on the
    proceedings of the summary judgment motion, might well lead to a miscarriage
    of justice.  Accordingly, I would admit the evidence.  I will discuss the
    appropriate disposition in light of that conclusion at the end of these reasons.</p>

    appellants allege that they did not receive effective assistance from their
    trial counsel, who also acted on the appeal to the Superior Court.  In view
    of my conclusion concerning the summary judgment motion and the fresh evidence
    I need not decide this issue.  In any event, I would be reluctant to deal
    with this issue in the absence of evidence from trial counsel.  While counsel
    before us acted with great diligence to bring the fresh and missing evidence
    before us, and are to be commended for that work, trial counsel does not
    appear to have been formally apprised that this appeal involved a challenge
    to his competence.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the future, where such an allegation is made, appellate counsel should have
    regard to the Procedural Protocol Re Allegations of Incompetence of Trial
    Counsel in Criminal Cases and follow so much of that Protocol as may be applicable
    to a child welfare appeal.  In particular, counsel should have regard to
    the provisions respecting notice, assertions of solicitor-client privilege,
    and access by respondent’s counsel to the trial counsel’s file.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[6]</span></a>  For
    convenience I have attached the Protocol as an appendix to these reasons.</p>

    view of the errors respecting the summary judgment motion, the appeal must
    be allowed.  Counsel for the appellants submits that in view of the fresh
    evidence this court is in a position to set aside the order for Crown wardship
    without access and return the children to the parents, perhaps with a supervision
    order under s. 57(1) of the Act.  In my view, that would not be an appropriate
    disposition.  The fresh evidence has not been tested by cross-examination
    and, while compelling, in my view, is not decisive on the question of what
    disposition would be in the best interests of the children.  Accordingly,
    I would allow the appeal and order a new hearing.  I would ask that the Ontario
    Court of Justice take steps to expedite this hearing before another judge.</p>
