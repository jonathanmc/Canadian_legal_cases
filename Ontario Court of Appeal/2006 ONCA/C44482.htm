style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal raises yet again the issue of whether the Superior Court has jurisdiction
    to entertain a unionized employee’s tort claim against her employer or whether
    the claim must be pursued under the collective agreement’s arbitration procedure.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents allege that they were sexually harassed and sexually assaulted
    by a fellow employee. The conduct they complain of includes leering, staring,
    sexually suggestive remarks, touching or grabbing of breasts, buttocks and
    crotch, as well as kissing without consent.  The respondents are unionized
    employees governed by a collective agreement pursuant to the <i>Canada Labour
    Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. L-2.  They commenced this tort action against their
    employer, the City of Ottawa and OC Transpo (the
    “appellants”), and the defendant Gauthier, a fellow employee at OC Transpo.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    claim against the appellants is based on vicarious liability.  The respondents
    say that the appellants did not live up to their legal duty to provide a
    safe workplace by failing to stop Gauthier from sexually harassing and assaulting
    them. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants brought a Rule 21 motion seeking to have the claims dismissed
    on the basis that as they arise from the interpretation, application, administration
    or alleged violation of the collective agreement, they must be dealt with
    by way of arbitration and that the court does not have jurisdiction.  The
    appellants also submitted that to the extent that the statement of claim
    is based on sexual harassment, it must be struck in any event as it amounts
    to a claim for discrimination under the <i>Canadian Human Rights Act</i>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6 (“<i>CHRA</i>”)<i> </i>and is not actionable in tort.  Gauthier
    did not appear on the motion nor did he participate in this appeal.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge concluded that the claims for sexual harassment fell under the
    exclusive jurisdiction of the arbitration procedure in the collective agreement.  Relying
    on the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Weber v. Ontario Hydro</i>,
    [1995] 2 S.C.R. 929, <i>Parry Sound (District) Social Services Administration
    Board v. O.P.S.E.U. Local 324</i>, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 157 and <i>Seneca College
    of Applied Arts &amp; Technology v. Bhaduria</i>, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 181, he
    agreed with the submission that sexual harassment constitutes a prohibited
    form of discrimination under the <i>CHRA</i> and that no tort action may
    be brought for this alleged wrong.  Accordingly, he struck all references
    in the statement of claim to sexual harassment.  No appeal is taken from
    that order. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge refused, however, to strike out the claims for sexual assault.  He
    ruled that the respondents were entitled to proceed with their claims for
    sexual assault in the Superior Court.  The motion judge relied on <i>Quebec
    (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v. Quebec
    (Attorney General),</i> [2004] 2 S.C.R. 185, (“<i>Quebec</i>”) where McLachlin
    C.J.C. stated at para. 11: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>Weber</i> does
    not stand for the proposition that labour arbitrators always have exclusive
    jurisdiction in employer-union disputes. Depending on the legislation and

    concurrent jurisdiction, or themselves be endowed with exclusive jurisdiction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    691 v. Irving Oil Ltd.</i> (1983), 148 D.L.R. (3d) 398 at p. 401 (N.B.C.A.),
    where a tort action was allowed to proceed on the following basis:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[T]he unlawful
    acts alleged in the present action relate to the maintenance of public order

    C.J.C. held, at para. 15, that where there is a jurisdictional issue as between
    the courts and a labour arbitrator, jurisdiction is to be determined through
    a two-part analysis. First, it is necessary to look at the relevant legislation
    and what it says about the arbitrator’s jurisdiction.  Second, it is necessary
    to look at the nature of the dispute in order to determine whether the legislation
    suggests that resolution of the dispute falls exclusively to the arbitrator.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    will deal first with the legislation. The relevant provisions of the <i>Canada
    Labour Code</i> are:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>s.&nbsp;56.   A
    collective agreement entered into between a bargaining agent and an employer
    in respect of a bargaining unit is, subject to and for the purposes of this
    Part, binding on the bargaining agent, every employee in the bargaining unit
    and the employer.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>s.&nbsp;57(1).
    Every collective agreement shall contain a provision for final settlement
    without stoppage of work, by arbitration or otherwise, of all differences
    between the parties to or employees bound by the collective agreement, concerning
    its interpretation, application, administration or alleged contravention.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;s. 58(1).
    Every order or decision of an arbitrator or arbitration board is final and
    shall not be questioned or reviewed in any court.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;s. 60(1).
    An arbitrator or arbitration board has </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='
text-align:left'>(a.1) the power to interpret, apply and give relief in accordance
    with a statute relating to employment matters, whether or not there is conflict
    between the statute and the collective agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>CHRA</i> is
    incorporated into the collective agreement by virtue of s. 60(1)(a.1) and
    by virtue of <i>Parry Sound, supra</i>.  The <i>CHRA</i> provides in s.&nbsp;14(2)
    that sexual harassment is deemed to be a prohibited form of discrimination.  The
    arbitrator therefore has the jurisdiction to deal with a complaint of sexual
    harassment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Acts
    of unwanted touching may form part of a pattern of conduct that amounts to
    sexual harassment as defined under human rights legislation: see <i>Janzen
    v. Platy Enterprises Ltd.</i>,<i> </i>[1989] 1 S.C.R. 1252 at p. 1282.  While
    acts of unwanted touching may also constitute the tort of assault, I agree
    with the submission of the appellants that the acts of unwanted touching
    pleaded in the present case may in law be dealt with as part and parcel of
    the sexual harassment complaint. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    when one looks to the legislation to determine what it says about the arbitrator’s
    jurisdiction, I conclude that the arbitrator does have jurisdiction to deal
    with the claims of sexual harassment even where those claims extend to physical
    contact capable of amounting to assault. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    turn to the second question: what is the nature of the dispute and does the
    legislation suggest that resolution of the dispute falls exclusively to the
    arbitrator?  The collective agreement provides for a comprehensive grievance
    and arbitration procedure. It is common ground that the motion judge properly
    identified the essential character of the dispute as being a “claim that
    the City failed to act in a proper manner to prevent or curtail the sexual
    harassment and the sexual assault of the plaintiffs by Mr. Gauthier”.  The <i>CHRA</i> definition
    and prohibition of sexual harassment discrimination are incorporated into
    the collective agreement and the employer is required to act accordingly.  In
    the end, this is a workplace dispute in which it is alleged that the employer
    failed to provide a safe working environment for its employees.  In my view,
    according to the jurisprudence binding on us, that brings this dispute squarely
    within the jurisdiction of the arbitrator under the collective agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the appellants’ submission that for the purpose of determining
    the arbitrator’s jurisdiction, there is no basis to distinguish between the
    claims framed in sexual assault and those framed in sexual harassment.  It
    has been held that regardless of the legal characterization of the dispute,
    where the dispute arises out of the collective agreement, it must be arbitrated
    and that
    “[p]arties cannot avoid arbitration simply by pleading a common law tort”: <i>Piko
    v. Hudson’s Bay Co. </i>(1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 729 at p.&nbsp;733 (C.A.); <i>Giorno
    v. Pappas</i> (1999), 42 O.R. (3d) 626 at p. 630 (C.A.). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    case relied on by the motion judge, <i>Irving Oil Ltd., supra, </i>was cited
    by McLachlin J. in <i>Weber</i> for the proposition that the decision maker
    must attempt to define the “essential character” of the dispute.  I do not
    agree that the effect of <i>Irving Oil</i> is to carve out of the arbitrator’s
    jurisdiction all tort claims alleging violent or criminal misconduct.  The
    determining factor in <i>Irving Oil</i> was not the nature of the alleged
    wrong but the finding, at p. 401, that the claims based upon conspiracy and
    watching and besetting were extrinsic to and did “not…arise out of the interpretation,
    application, administration or alleged violation of the collective agreement”.  There
    is now a consistent line of authority interpreting the <i>Weber</i> principle
    to embrace jurisdiction over any tort claim that amounts to a dispute arising
    under the collective agreement: see <i>Piko</i>, <i>supra</i> and <i>Giorno</i>, <i>supra</i>.  Where,
    as in the present case, the alleged wrong relates directly to conduct in
    the workplace and to the employer’s obligation to provide a safe working
    environment, it would be inconsistent with the <i>Weber</i> principle, as
    elaborated in <i>Piko</i> and <i>Giorno</i>, to carve out an exception for
    violent or criminal acts. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents rely on <i>Chapman v. 3M Canada Inc.</i> (1995), 24 C.C.L.T.
    304 (Ont. Gen. Div.), aff’d (1997), 37 C.C.L.T. (2d) 319 (Ont. C.A.).  In
    that case the plaintiff, who was covered by a collective agreement, sued
    her employer for a variety of causes of action including constructive dismissal,
    breach of collective agreement, assault, sexual assault, sexual harassment,
    discrimination on the basis of sex, breach of fiduciary obligation and occupier’s
    liability.  The defendant employer successfully moved to strike out the portions
    of the statement of claim alleging constructive dismissal, breach of collective
    agreement, sexual harassment, discrimination on the basis of sex and occupier’s
    liability on a variety of grounds, including that the court had no jurisdiction
    over the subject matter of those causes of action.  The defendant did not
    move to strike out the claims for assault, sexual assault, sexual harassment
    or breach of fiduciary obligation and accordingly, those claims were allowed
    to proceed to trial.  Given the limited relief sought by the employer on
    the motion to strike, the reasons of the motion judge and the reasons of
    this court affirming the motion judge’s decision do not deal with the issue
    before us in the present case, namely, whether the claims for sexual assault
    must be pursued under the arbitration procedure of the collective agreement.  Accordingly,
    I do not accept the submission that <i>Chapman </i>supports the position
    of the respondents.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'><i><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents submit that we should maintain the jurisdiction of the court
    on the basis that they may receive a lower damages award in arbitration because
    the <i>CHRA</i>, in s.<b>&nbsp;</b>53, limits the amount of damages a victim
    of discrimination may receive.  Section 53(2) allows for an order to compensate
    the victim for wages lost and expenses incurred as a result of the discrimination
    and for an amount not exceeding twenty thousand dollars for pain and suffering.  Section
    53(3) provides for additional compensation not exceeding twenty thousand
    dollars to the victim if the discrimination has been wilful or reckless.
    The net effect of s. 53 would appear to be that the maximum award of damages
    that a victim may receive is forty thousand dollars, plus compensation for
    lost wages or expenses incurred as a result of the discriminatory practice.  Assuming,
    without deciding, that the damages recoverable by way of arbitration would
    be less than the amount a court could award in an action for sexual assault,
    does that provide a basis for the court to assume jurisdiction over the dispute?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    some cases, lack of an effective remedy may justify the exercise of the court’s
    jurisdiction.  In <i>Weber</i>, McLachlin J. noted, at para. 57, that even
    in cases where an arbitrator has exclusive jurisdiction over the dispute,
    the court may exercise its inherent remedial jurisdiction where the arbitrator
    does not have the power to grant a required remedy.  In <i>Weber,</i> McLachlin
    J. adopted Estey J.’s statement from <i>St. Anne Nackawic Pulp &amp; Paper
    Co. v. Canadian Paper Workers Union, Local 219</i>, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 704 at
    p. 723 that: “[w]hat must be avoided, to use the language of Estey J. … is
    a ‘real deprivation of ultimate remedy’”.   The examples of a remedial gap
    amounting to the deprivation of a remedy given by McLachlin J. were the lack
    of jurisdiction to award injunctions or make declarations.  <ins cite="mailto:Sharpe"

    a court could grant:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It is of no
    moment that arbitrators may not always have approached the awarding of damages
    in the same way that courts have awarded damages in tort. In <i>Weber</i>,
    at p. 958 S.C.R., p.&nbsp;603 D.L.R., McLachlin J. made clear that arbitrators
    are to apply the same law as the courts. Laskin J.A. put it this way in <i>Piko</i> at
    para. 22:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
    do not rest my decision on any differences between the power of courts and
    the power of arbitrators to award damages for a tort, such as the tort of
    malicious prosecution. I recognize that arbitrators may apply common law
    principles in awarding damages, and, more importantly, the breadth of an
    arbitrator’s power to award damages does not necessarily determine whether <i>Weber</i> applies.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>What is important
    is that the arbitrator is empowered to remedy the wrong. If that is so, then
    where the essential character of the dispute is covered by the collective
    agreement, to require that it be arbitrated, not litigated in the courts,
    causes no “real deprivation of ultimate remedy”. . .The individual is able
    to pursue an appropriate remedy through the specialized vehicle of arbitration.
    He or she is not left without a way to seek relief.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    even if the damages the respondents would recover by way of arbitration could
    be less than the amount they would recover in an action, the arbitrator is
    still empowered to remedy the wrong and there is no remedial gap amounting
    to the effective deprivation of remedy sufficient to justify the assumption
    of jurisdiction by the court.  </p>

    respondents submit that as Gauthier is not a party to the collective agreement,
    they are free to sue him in the courts and that they should be permitted
    to pursue their entire claim in one proceeding.  They say that this provides
    a reason for the court to assume jurisdiction over the entire dispute.  This
    point was also dealt with in <i>Giorno </i>at p.&nbsp;632, and in <i>Piko</i> at
    p. 734: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>As to the respondent
    Pappas, while he is an employee of the respondent Crown, he had no managerial
    responsibility over Ms. Giorno.  Nor was he an employee covered by the collective
    agreement.  Despite this, given that this dispute arises under the collective
    agreement the principle in <i>Weber</i> still applies.  As Laskin J.A. said
    in <i>Piko</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 13 [p. 734]:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Where an employee
    has sued another employee for a workplace wrong, this court has held that
    bringing an action against a person who is not a party to the collective
    agreement will not give the court jurisdiction if the dispute, “in its essential
    character”, still arises under the collective agreement.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Giorno</i> has
    been consistently followed for the proposition that where the dispute arises
    out of the collective agreement, it will not matter that the plaintiff seeks
    redress against a fellow employee, as <i>Weber</i> still demands that the
    dispute be heard by an arbitrator: See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>McConnell v. Altenburg</i>,
    [2001] O.J. No. 4668 at para. 23 (S.C.J.); <i>Renaud v. LaSalle (Town) Police
    Association</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 4474 (S.C.J.) at paras. 31-33; <i>Richards
    v. Catney</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 1159 at para. 29 (S.C.J.), aff’d on other
    grounds [2005] O.J. No. 5230 (C.A.).  Accordingly, naming Gauthier as a defendant
    does not alter the application of the <i>Weber</i> principle that this dispute
    is subject to arbitration because it arises out of the collective agreement.</p>

    have considerable sympathy for the result reached by the motion judge and
    for the respondents’ assertion that they should be permitted to pursue their
    claims for sexual assault in the courts.  The claims arise from allegations
    of criminal misconduct that affront the respondents’ personal dignity and
    physical integrity, yet they are compelled to pursue them under the collective
    agreement’s arbitration procedure, where they will not have personal carriage
    of the proceedings.  However, <i>Weber</i> and its progeny deprive them of
    the right to prosecute their claim in the courts and we must give effect
    to the jurisprudence that is binding on this court. </p>
