  <h2>ENDORSEMENT</h2>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants, O.M. and M.M., are the parents of four year old L.M..  L.M.
    was apprehended by the respondent Children’s Aid Society of Toronto on the
    day he was born, December&nbsp;24,&nbsp;2001.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    June&nbsp;6,&nbsp;2002, Waldman&nbsp;J. of the Ontario Court of Justice made
    a finding that L.M. was a child in need of protection pursuant to s.&nbsp;37(2)(b)
    of the <i>Child and Family Services Act</i>.  L.M. was ordered to be made
    a Crown ward for three months with access to his parents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    a status review application dated September&nbsp;3,&nbsp;2002, the CAS sought
    an order making L.M. a Crown ward without access, for the purpose of adoption.  A
    trial was held before Foster&nbsp;J. of the Ontario Court of Justice over
    thirteen days in October and November&nbsp;2003.  On January&nbsp;23,&nbsp;2004,
    Foster&nbsp;J. ordered that L.M. be made a Crown ward with no access.  Justice
    Foster found that L.M. was “very adoptable”.  He said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, securing L.M.’s adoption and thereby
    his opportunity for a permanent placement outweighs the loss of connection
    to his parents and siblings as well as the possibility things may change
    in the future so as to allow him to one day return home.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants appealed to Goodman&nbsp;J. of the Superior Court of Justice who
    dismissed the appeal.  She held that the trial judge did not err in principle.  Moreover,
    the trial judge considered the relevant factors and there was evidentiary
    support for the judgment.  Justice Goodman further held that the CAS had
    demonstrated the continuing need for protection of L.M. as well as that
    it was in his best interests to remain in the care of the CAS as a Crown
    ward, without access, for the purpose of adoption.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants appeal to this court.  Although they raise many issues, the core
    of their argument is that Foster&nbsp;J. erred in finding that there was
    a lack of cooperation by the appellants and/or an inability to monitor compliance
    by the respondent.  They argue that both judges below did not give sufficient
    weight to the “positive and cooperative”
    behaviour of the appellants.  They attempt to demonstrate that they are good
    parents through evidence of “positive visits” with their children.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not agree with the appellants’ submissions for two reasons.  First, in
    our opinion, the key factual findings by the trial judge, described above,
    were unquestionably supported by the evidence.  Contrary to the appellants’ contention,
    we are not persuaded that the trial judge misapprehended the nature and significance
    of the evidence on these key issues or that he assigned an undue or disproportionate
    weight to the relevant evidence.  Second, Goodman&nbsp;J.’s reasons are comprehensive.  She
    dealt with all the aspects of the reasons of the trial judge, Foster&nbsp;J.,
    whose reasons were also very thorough.  Her conclusion that the trial judge’s
    reasons and disposition were sound was, in our view, correct.  Moreover,
    Goodman&nbsp;J.’s ultimate conclusion that “the respondent Society has demonstrated
    the continued need of protection of L.M. as well as that it is in his best
    interests to remain in the care of the respondent society as a Crown ward,
    without access, for the purposes of adoption” was, in our view, entirely
    appropriate.</p>
