style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Mary Louise Pepper, alleges that, in August
    2002, her pharmacy and pharmacist mislabelled her medication, as a result of
    which she suffered harm requiring hospital care.  Within two days, the appellants, Ms. Pepper and her children,
    notified Zellers Pharmacy, the pharmacy named on the medication label. Zellers
    informed the pharmacists who operated the pharmacy, Emad Youssef and Baher
    Shenouda, who in turn notified Lee Aube, the dispensing pharmacist. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In October 2002, the appellants sued Zellers, alleging
    negligence and breach of contract, both arising from the mislabelling.  In November 2002, Zellers denied any
    involvement. It informed the appellants that the pharmacy was owned by Messrs.
    Youssef and Shenouda, both of whom had signed an agreement to indemnify Zellers
    for any claims, but did not disclose that the pharmacy was owned “in Trust for
    a Company to be Incorporated.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants did not ask for the name of the dispensing
    pharmacist.  On August 20, 2004, almost
    two years after the incident, they commenced a second action, this time against
    Messrs. Youssef and Shenouda; however, the statement of claim did not name a
    dispensing pharmacist.</p>

line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In September 2004, Mr. Shenouda’s lawyer told the appellants
    that the dispensing pharmacist was Lee Aube, who was a <i>locum tenens</i> at
    the pharmacy at the time of the incident.  In November 2004, the appellants moved to add Ms. Aube to the 2004
    action.  Subsequently, Mr. Shenouda
    disclosed that, while “Zellers Pharmacy” operated in space leased from Zellers,
    it was owned and operated by 1520334, a company of which Mr. Shenouda was the
    sole shareholder, as he had acquired Mr. Youssef’s interest prior to its
    incorporation.  As a result of this
    disclosure, the appellants amended their motion to add both 1520334 and Lee
    Aube as parties to the 2002 action, an action that indisputably had been commenced
    within any applicable limitation period. </p>

    arguing that the appellants failed to show special circumstances that would
    justify their addition after the expiration of the limitation period.  In response, the appellants argued that the
    limitation period had not expired.  At
    the same time, Mr. Shenouda and Mr. Youssef, in motions for summary judgment,
    sought to have the proceedings against them dismissed.</p>

    begin to run until the 2004 disclosure by Messrs. Youssef and Shenouda of the
    identities of Ms. Aube and 1520334.  Alternatively, the appellants argued that 1520334 was not entitled to
    the protection of the <i>RHPA</i> one-year
    limitation period, but only to the general limitation period of six years set
    out in the <i>Limitations Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. L.15, s. 45.  Finally, the
    appellants argued that the <i>Limitations
    Act, 2002</i>, S.O. 2002, c. 24 Sch. B
    (<i>Limitations Act, 2002</i>), which came into force on January 1, 2004, applied to extend the limitation period.</p>

    judge dismissed the appellants’ motion, finding that the <i>RHPA</i> one-year limitation period applied and that it had
    expired.  He concluded that the
    limitation period was not extended on the basis of discoverability because the
    appellants had failed to tender any evidence of their due diligence in
    ascertaining the respondents’ identities.  As well, the motion judge concluded that the <i>Limitations Act, 2002 </i>did not extend the <i>RHPA </i>limitation period.  The
    motion judge granted the motions for summary judgment brought by Messrs.
    Youssef and Shenouda and dismissed the 2004 action against them.</p>

    entitled to conclude on the record that the appellants had not demonstrated due
    diligence in ascertaining the identity of Ms. Aube.  In my view, however, the motion judge erred in concluding that
    the <i>RHPA </i>limitation period applied to

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary to the appellants’ argument, the motion was not akin
    to a rule 26.01 motion to amend a pleading, which “shall” be granted absent
    compensable prejudice.  Rather, a rule
    5.04(2) motion to add parties and, in this case, to add parties after the
    apparent expiration of a limitation period, is discretionary.  While the threshold on such a motion is low,
    the motion judge is entitled to consider the evidentiary record to determine
    whether there is a live issue of fact or credibility about the commencement
    date of the limitation period. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Recognizing that s. 89 of the <i>RHPA</i> specifically provided that the limitation period commenced
    “when the person commencing the action knew or ought to have known the facts
    upon which the negligence or malpractice is alleged”, the motion judge noted
    that the appellants failed to provide any evidence about when they “ought to
    have known” the respondents’ identities. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first question in this case related to discoverability, a
    principle that provides that a limitation period commences when the plaintiff
    discovers the underlying material facts or, alternatively, when the plaintiff
    ought to have discovered those facts by the exercise of reasonable
    diligence.  This principle ensures that
    a person is not unjustly precluded from litigation before he or she has the information
    to commence an action provided that the person can demonstrate he or she
    exercised reasonable or due diligence to discover the information.  See <i>Peixeiro
    v. Haberman, </i>[1997] 3 S.C.R. 549.  The obligation on a plaintiff to exercise
    reasonable diligence is a positive one: see <i>Soper
    v. Southcott</i>, [1998] O.J. No. 2799 (C.A.). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This principle, codified in s. 89(1), applies both to the discoverability of facts and to the
    discoverability of the tortfeasor’s identity.  See <i>Aguonie v. Galion Solid Waste Material
    Inc </i>(1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 161
    (C.A.); <i>Zapfe v. Barnes</i> (2003), 66 O.R. (3d) 397 (C.A.) at 405. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge referred to the proper approach to
    discoverability on a motion to add a party, which was concisely and clearly set
    out by Master Dash in <i>Wong v. Adler</i>,
    (2004), 70 O.R. (3d) 460 (S.C.J.) at para. 45, aff’d [2005] O.J. No. 1400 (Div. Ct.): <i></i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>What is the approach a judge or master
    should take on a motion to add a defendant where the plaintiff wishes to plead
    that the limitation period has not yet expired because she did not know of and
    could not with due diligence have discovered the existence of that
    defendant?  In my view, as is clearly
    implied in Zapfe, the motions court must examine the evidentiary record before
    it to determine if there is an issue of fact or of credibility on the
    discoverability allegation, which is a constituent element of the claim.  If the court determines that there is such
    issue, the defendant should be added with leave to plead a limitations
    defence.  If there is no such issue, as
    for example where the evidence before the motions court clearly indicates that
    the name of the tortfeasor and the essential facts that make up the cause of
    action against such tortfeasor, were actually known to the plaintiff or her
    solicitor more than two years before the motion to amend, the motion should be
    refused.  If the issue is due diligence
    rather than actual knowledge, this is much more likely to involve issues of
    credibility requiring a trial or summary judgment motion, provided of course
    that the plaintiff gives a reasonable explanation on proper evidence as to why
    such information was not obtainable with due diligence.  That is not to say that such motion could
    never be denied if the evidence is clear and uncontradicted that the plaintiff
    could have obtained the requisite information with due diligence such that
    there is no issue of fact or credibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with Master Dash that the motion judge was entitled to
    assess the record to determine, as a question of fact, whether there was “a
    reasonable explanation” on the evidence demonstrating why Ms. Aube’s identity
    could not have been determined through the exercise of reasonable
    diligence.  See also <i>Zapfe, supra</i> at para. 31. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An examination of the evidentiary record in this case shows
    that the appellants’ material failed entirely to address whether they ought to
    have known Ms. Aube’s identity and what, if any, steps they took to determine
    that identity.  Indeed, the appellants
    offer no explanation other than to say that no one gave them the information. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly, there was no affidavit from the appellants’
    lawyer, only one from the lawyer’s law clerk, which provided no particulars of
    any steps taken to obtain information and did not explain why no steps were
    taken.  For example, there was no
    reference to any inquiry of Zellers or of Messrs. Yassouf or Shenouda about the
    name of the dispensing pharmacist and no explanation about why the two pharmacy
    operators were not sued until long after the expiration of the limitation
    period.  As this court said in <i>Zapfe, supra</i>, at para. 35: “In most cases one would expect to find, as part
    of a solicitor's affidavit, a list of the attempts made by the solicitor to
    obtain information to substantiate the assertion that the party was reasonably
    diligent.”&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge’s reasons reflect the absence of this
    critical evidence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>As it seems to
    me, the grave weakness in all this affidavit evidence proffered by the
    plaintiffs is that there is <u>no evidence</u> at all from the solicitor or
    solicitors who handled Ms. Pepper’s case from the outset about the inquiries
    and investigation, if any, that were made to ascertain all <u>potentially
    liable parties</u> for Ms. Pepper’s illness.  [Emphasis in original.] </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
class=Heading1Char>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It appears from the absence of any evidence on
    this issue, and from their statement of claim, that the appellants were unaware
    of the need to claim against the dispensing pharmacist and believed they only
    needed to claim against the pharmacy or pharmacy owners.  However, ignorance of the liability of the

line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, s. 24(2) restricts the application of the new
    regime <span lang=EN>“to claims… in respect of which
    no proceeding has been commenced before January 1, 2004.”  Since a proceeding with respect to this
    incident was commenced in 2002, long before January 1, 2004, the 2002 Act does
    not apply.  </span></p>

    24(3) provides that “[i]f the former limitation period expired before the
    effective date, no proceeding shall be commenced in respect of the claim.”  Since the former limitation period had
    expired with respect to Ms. Aube before January 1, 2004, the new regime offers
    no assistance. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellants argued that the limitation period
    applies only to negligence or malpractice actions and not to their action
    against Ms. Aube in breach of contract, which would otherwise have attracted a
    six-year limitation period at the time of the incident.  I do not agree. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Limitation periods with respect to negligence or malpractice
    apply to all causes of action arising out of that negligence or
    malpractice.  In this case, as in most
    similar actions, the same facts that gave rise to the negligence claim also
    gave rise to the breach of contract claim.  Section 89(1) of the <i>RHPA</i> specifically provided that the
    limitation applies “to any action arising out of negligence or
    malpractice.”  A claim for breach of
    contract based on the mislabelling is a claim “arising out of” Ms. Aube’s
    alleged negligence or malpractice.  Accordingly, in the absence of a distinct basis for the breach of
    contract claim, the appellants are precluded from bringing that action.</p>

  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The limitation period issue differs regarding 1520334.  In my view, 1520334 is not entitled to the
    benefit of the <i>RHPA</i> limitation
    period.  Rather, the claim against
    1520334 is governed by the general six-year limitation period that applied at
    the time of the incident, since modified by the <i>Limitations Act, 2002</i>, s. 5<i>.</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn first to a consideration of the relevant provision of
    the <i>RHPA, </i>which I repeat for ease of
    reference:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>s. 89(3) A <b>health profession corporation</b> <b>that holds or held a certificate of
    authorization</b> is not liable to any action arising out of negligence or
    malpractice in respect of professional services requested of, or rendered by,
    the corporation unless the action is commenced within one year after the date
    when the person commencing the action knew or ought to have known the fact or
    facts upon which the alleged negligence or malpractice is based. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On a plain reading of s. 89(3), only a health profession
    corporation is entitled to the benefit of the one-year limitation period.  A “health profession corporation” is defined
    by the <i>RHPA</i>, s. 1(1) as meaning “a
    corporation incorporated under the <i>Business
    Corporations Act</i> that holds a valid certificate of authorization issued
    under this Act or the Code.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The government enacted this legislation in 2001, which
    established authorized health profession corporations as vehicles for
    professional practice.  Pharmacists, who
    had historically been able to practise through their own corporations, as did
    1520334, were entitled to fulfill the requirements to become authorized as a
    health profession corporation.  Since
    1520334 did not take the necessary steps to do so, it does not hold a valid
    certificate of authorization and is not a health profession corporation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, 1520334 argues that it should be entitled to the
    same limitation period as a health care corporation because it performs the
    same function as a health profession corporation.  Alternatively, it argues that since 1520334 operates as a
    pharmacist, it should be entitled to the benefit of the same limitation period
    as a pharmacist. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On this issue, 1520334 relies on <i>Goff v. Barker</i> (1978), 22 O.R. (2d) 43 (H.C.J.) which, contrary to
    the result I reach in this case, held that a pharmacy is entitled to the same
    limitation period as an individual pharmacist.  In coming to that conclusion, Callon J. reviewed the scheme of the
    legislation then in place and explained:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It is,
    therefore, clear that the whole scheme of the Pharmacy Act is to restrict the
    dispensing of drugs to pharmaceutical chemists but to allow the operation of a
    pharmacy by a corporation so long as the majority of its directors are
    registered as pharmaceutical chemists and so long as the pharmacy is under the
    personal supervision of and is managed by a pharmaceutical chemist. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the <i>Drug and
    Pharmacies Regulation Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.4, s. 142(1), continues to
    provide that a corporation cannot “own or operate a pharmacy unless the
    majority of the directors or the corporation are pharmacists”, the relevant
    limitation period was governed by the <i>RHPA </i>and the <i>Code</i>.  That legislation provided a limitation period specific to health profession
    corporations, in addition to the one previously in place for pharmacists.  By providing a specific limitation period,
    the legislature determined that only certain corporations – authorized health
    profession corporations – were entitled to the protection of the <i>RHPA</i>’s<i> </i>one-year limitation period.  Presumably, it did so to encourage corporations operating in health care
    to apply for the requisite certificate of authorization and deliberately chose
    not to extend limitation protection to corporations that chose not to do so. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, since 1520334 is not a health profession
    corporation, it did not have the benefit of s. 89(3)’s one-year limitation
    period. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, even if 1520334 is not entitled to the benefits of a
    limitations defence, it argues that it should not be added as a party for
    another reason: the appellants cannot have a tenable cause of action against
    1520334 if they have no tenable cause of action against Lee Aube.  This is so, it argues, because the only tenable
    cause of action against 1520334 would be based on its vicarious liability for
    Ms. Aube and, since all parties acknowledge Ms. Aube’s role as an independent
    contractor, vicarious liability cannot be an issue.  See <i>671122 Ontario Ltd. v.
    Sagaz Industries Inc. </i>[2001] S.C.R. 983. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On this point, the motion judge agreed that 1520334’s
    liability could only be based on vicarious liability.  Referring to <i>Goff v. Barker</i>,
    the motion judge said at para. 105:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Under Callon
    J.’s holding, if the pharmacist is not liable for dispensing the drug because
    of the intervening limitation period, the company operating the pharmacy must
    also be necessarily immunized because its liability could only be based on the
    doctrine of vicarious liability. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree.  On the
    basis of the materials before this court, the appellants have a triable issue
    on other causes of action against 1520334 that are unrelated to their cause of
    action against the pharmacist.  The
    statement of claim alleges multiple causes of action and independent acts of
    negligence against the pharmacy, including a pleading that 1520334 was
    negligent in its hiring, training, and supervision of pharmacists.  As well, the appellants’ material raises a
    possible cause of action against 1520334 in fraudulent concealment.  The viability of these causes of action is
    best determined on the record once 1520334 is added as a party to the
    proceedings and pleadings are complete. </p>
