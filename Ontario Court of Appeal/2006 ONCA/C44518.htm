style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant
    to a consent judgment dated October 12, 2004, a reference was held before
    Deputy Registrar Stevens in London to determine the matters at issue in this
    action, including the issues as between the respondent, the second mortgagee,
    and the appellant, the third and fourth mortgagee, of lands in Chatham.  As
    relevant to the proceedings before this court, by reasons dated May 17, 2005,
    the Referee:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>allowed
    the respondent credits in its favour on the mortgage account for the sum
    of $6,204.78 in respect of utilities expenses paid by the respondent and
    the further amount of $10,163.64 owed to Union Gas;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>denied
    the respondent’s claim for a credit in its favour on the mortgage account
    in the sum of $10,000 in respect of a payment made by the mortgagor to the
    respondent; and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>allowed
    the respondent a credit in its favour on the mortgage account in the additional
    sum of $5,000 paid by the mortgagor to Mr. Hanson, one of the respondent’s
    solicitors, on account of legal fees incurred by the respondent in connection
    with the negotiation of an extension of the mortgage in question.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    October 21, 2005, on subsequent motions to oppose confirmation of the Referee’s
    report, Donohue J. confirmed the Referee’s report in all save the following
    respects (the “confirmation order”).  First, he allowed the respondent credit
    for all utilities expenses paid in the sum of $50,825.72 (and confirmed the
    amount of $10,163.64 owed to Union Gas).  Second, he disallowed any credit
    to the respondent for the $5,000 payment made by the mortgagor on account
    of the respondent’s legal fees incurred in association with the mortgage
    extension.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals that part of the confirmation order that credited the respondent
    with the full amount of the utilities expenses ($50,825.72) and the additional
    sum owed to Union Gas ($10,163.64).  The respondent, in turn, cross-appeals
    from those aspects of the confirmation order that disallowed the $5,000 credit
    on account of legal fees paid to the respondent’s solicitor and that upheld
    the Referee’s decision to disallow any credit to the respondent for the $10,000
    payment by the mortgagor to the respondent at the time of the extension agreement.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>1.            Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are satisfied that the appeal must be allowed in part.  No credit should
    be allowed to the respondent, as against Extura, for utilities payments in
    excess of the sum of $6,204.78.  No invoices from the utilities supplier
    were produced on the reference.  Letters from the supplier indicated that
    a total of $6,204.78 was required to be paid by the respondent in order to
    maintain service at the mortgaged premises.  It is undisputed that this amount,
    in fact, was paid by the respondent.  The balance of the claimed utilities
    arrears, however, were identified by the supplier as referable to persons
    other than the mortgagor.  Moreover, the respondent appears to have made
    no inquiries to ascertain either the monies actually owed by the mortgagor
    or the proper identity of the debtors.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    these circumstances, the respondent failed to meet its obligation to establish
    the reasonableness of the utilities payments as ‘just allowances’ to the
    mortgage account.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    all other respects, we would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>2.            Cross-Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would also dismiss the cross-appeal for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relation to the $10,000 payment by the mortgagor to the respondent, both
    the Referee and Donohue J. disallowed the respondent’s claim for credit.  The
    Referee noted at paragraph 6 of his reasons that there was no evidence before
    him that the $10,000 was paid as a bonus, as alleged by the respondent.  The
    record supports that finding.  Accordingly, as there is no reason to interfere
    with this finding, it follows that the Referee correctly directed that the
    amount of $10,000 be credited to the appellant Extura on the mortgage account.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect of the $5,000 payment on account of the respondent’s legal fees with
    Solicitor Hanson, Donohue J. reversed the Referee on the basis that there
    was no evidence to support this charge.  There appears to have been no account
    rendered to support this charge; nor does the record before us contain such
    an account.  In our view, therefore, Donohue J.’s determination of this matter
    must stand.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>3.            Disposition</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, the appeal is allowed in part and para. 1(i) of the confirmation
    order dated October 21, 2005 is amended to read as follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The [respondent] is entitled to charge in its favour
    to the mortgage account utility payments in the total amount of $6,204.78,
    plus the Union Gas fee in the sum of $10,163.64.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the funds previously paid into court by the appellant Extura, in the sum
    of $48,545.40, shall be paid out to it, together with all accrued interest
    thereon.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant Extura is entitled to its costs of these proceedings, fixed in
    the total amount of $14,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST.  We make
    no change to the costs disposition of Donohue J.</p>
