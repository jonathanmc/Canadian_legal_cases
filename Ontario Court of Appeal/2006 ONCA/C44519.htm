    Villeneuve Co. Ltd. appeals from the decision of Justice Nadeau of the Superior
    Court of Justice dated August 31, 2005, (1) dismissing the appellant’s action
    and (2) allowing the respondents’
    counterclaim for rescission of an agreement between the parties pertaining
    to the removal of sand and gravel from the respondents’ property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also ordered the appellant to remove the agreement from the title
    to the respondents’ property and ordered the respondents to pay the appellant
    the sum of $4,000 on the basis of unjust enrichment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in setting aside the agreement
    on the basis of unconscionability, erred in deciding significant credibility
    issues without a proper analysis of the evidence, erred in granting rescission
    when this remedy should have been barred by laches and delay and erred in
    only granting the sum of $4,000 for compensation as a way of putting the
    appellant back into its original position as a term of granting rescission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s reasons demonstrate that he addressed the issue of credibility – which
    he correctly observed was the central issue in the case – throughout his
    reasons, after having set out the general principles that he considered and
    applied at the beginning of those reasons.  Although the trial judge’s reasons
    were not detailed in his treatment of the specifics of the evidence, a reading
    of them as a whole makes it clear that the trial judge did not accept the
    story told to him by Mr. Villeneuve, the principal plaintiff’s witness, or
    the evidence put forward by the plaintiff as a whole, and why.  The trial
    judge need not explain his reasoning with respect to every piece of evidence
    or contradictions raised.  His findings were clearly open to him on the record.  In
    particular, contrary to the appellant’s submission, the discovery evidence
    of Mr. Boivin did not contradict the evidence of the respondents.  Mr. Boivin
    did not have an independent recollection of the events surrounding the execution
    of the agreement in this case; rather, his testimony concerned only his general
    approach. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    credibility determinations were undoubtedly important to the trial judge’s
    approach to the case.  Having made his determinations in that regard, there
    was ample evidence to support his decision to rescind the agreement on unfairness
    and hardship grounds.  This evidence included the circumstances surrounding
    the execution of the agreement, the fact that the second agreement contained
    significantly different terms than the first (a perpetual term and a termination
    clause only in favour of the appellant), the lack of independent legal advice
    to the respondents, the unequal bargaining position of the parties, the fact
    that everything was done in English including the agreements (whereas the
    Pominvilles were unilingual francophones), the overreaching nature of certain
    aspects of the agreement, the treatment of the respondents, and their difficulties
    with registration of the agreement against their title: see Justice Robert
    J. Sharpe, <i>Injunctions &amp; Specific Performance</i>, 3rd ed. (Aurora,
    Ont.:<i> </i>Canada Law Book, 2000) c.&nbsp;10 at para. 10:20, and G.H.L.

line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge specifically addressed the issue of laches and delay and found
    on the facts that the respondents’ conduct did not amount to laches or delay
    in the circumstances.  We can find no basis for interfering with the trial
    judge’s conclusion in this regard.  The respondents did not become aware
    of the agreement on title until 1995 and, thereafter, had difficulty finding
    a francophone lawyer in the area who would act for them.  The trial judge
    also found that the respondents had attempted to raise their concerns with
    the appellant but to no avail. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    would we interfere with his decision to award $4,000 as compensation for
    unjust enrichment.  The trial judge considered the frailties of the evidence
    put forward regarding the appellant’s expenses and the fact that the appellant
    would not be saddled with remedial costs after closure of the site.  It was
    open to him in the circumstances to order the sum that he did.</p>

line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is dismissed.  The appellant is entitled to costs of the appeal
    fixed at $17,500, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T. </p>
