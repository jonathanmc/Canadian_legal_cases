  <p class=MsoBodyText>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Paul M. Perell
    of the Superior Court of Justice dated November 4, 2005.</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>BY THE COURT:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    main issue on this appeal concerns the proper interpretation of s. 258(1)
    of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I. 8, which permits, in certain
    circumstances, an injured third party to enforce a motor vehicle insurance
    contract directly against the insurer of the person who caused a motor vehicle
    accident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Background</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    April 2, 2000, the plaintiff, Ms. Winch, was involved in a motor vehicle
    accident with the defendant, Mr. Keogh. At the time of the accident, Mr.
    Keogh was not driving his own vehicle. Rather, he was driving a cube van,
    with a manufacturer's gross weight rating of more than 4,500 kilograms. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Prior
    to the accident, Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Insurance Company issued a policy
    of automobile insurance to Mr. Keogh. Royal's policy included a provision
    providing coverage for other vehicles driven by the insured. However, it
    also contained a provision indicating that coverage did not extend to vehicles
    with a manufacturer's gross weight rating of more than 4,500 kilograms.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    a motion to determine a point of law, Perell J. found that Royal is not obliged
    under s. 258(1) of the <i>Insurance Act</i> to compensate Ms. Winch. In reaching
    this conclusion, the motion judge relied on <i>Walker v. Allstate Insurance
    Company of Canada</i>, [1989] O.J. No. 710 (C.A). The motion judge determined
    that Walker stands for two points that are significant in this case: first,
    there can be no recovery by a third party under s. 258(1) “unless the insured
    could have been entitled to an indemnity under the insurance policy”; and
    second, ss. 258(4) and (5) of the <i>Insurance Act</i> apply only after the
    possibility of indemnity to the insured has been established.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    appeal, CAA Insurance Company submits that the motion judge erred in his
    interpretation of s. 258. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    relevant portions of s. 258(1) of the <i>Insurance Act</i> are as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>258(1) Any person who has a claim against an insured
    for which indemnity is provided by a contract evidenced by a motor vehicle
    liability policy, even if such person is not a party to the contract, may,
    upon recovering a judgment therefore in any province or territory of Canada
    against the insured, have the insurance money payable under the contract
    applied in or towards satisfaction of the person’s judgment and of any other
    judgments or claims against the insured covered by the contract…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>258(4) The right of a person who is entitled under
    subsection (1) to have insurance money applied upon the person’s judgment
    or claim is not prejudiced by,</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>an
    assignment, waiver, surrender, cancellation or discharge of the contract,

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>any
    act or default of the insured before or after that event in contravention
    of the Part or of the terms of the contract;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>any
    contravention of the Criminal Code (Canada) or of a statute of any province
    or territory of Canada or of any state or the District of Columbia of the
    United States of America by the owner or driver of the automobile,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>and nothing mentioned in clause a, b or c is available
    to the insurer as a defence in an action brought under subsection 1.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(5) It is not a defence to an action under this
    section that an instrument issued as a motor vehicle liability policy by
    a person engaged in the business of an insurer and alleged by a party to
    the action to be such a policy is not a motor vehicle liability policy, and
    this section applies with necessary modifications to the instrument.</p>
  <h3>Discussion</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CAA
    contends that the decision in <i>Walker</i> was premised on the language
    of the standard form policy of motor vehicle accident insurance in effect
    at the time that case was decided and that there are important differences
    between that language and the language contained in the current standard
    form policy. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time <i>Walker</i> was decided, the relevant policy provided as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Consent of owner: No person shall
      be entitled to indemnity or payment under this policy who is an occupant
      of an automobile which is being used without the consent of the owner.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Currently,
    rather than speaking of entitlement to
    “indemnity or payment” under the policy, the standard form policy (OAP1)
    speaks to the issue of coverage. CAA submits that while the issue of coverage
    under a policy is a matter to be determined as between the insured and the
    insurer, that is a separate issue from the issue of whether s. 258(1) has
    been triggered. While, on its face, the policy in Walker precluded indemnity
    and therefore the application of s. 258(1), OAP1 speaks about coverage and
    does not expressly exclude indemnity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying
    on <i>Campanaro v. Kim</i>, [1998] O.J. No. 3518 (C.A.), <i>Ashton v. Tu</i>,
    [1998] O.J. No. 2239 (C.A.) and <i>Joachin v. Abel</i>, O.J. No. 2869 (C.A.),
    CAA submits that the threshold issue in determining whether s. 258(1) applies
    is whether the insurer issued a motor vehicle liability policy that provides
    an indemnity to the insured. Here, the threshold was met because Royal issued
    a motor vehicle policy to Mr. Keogh.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CAA
    contends that once the threshold is met, the only exceptions to the requirement
    under s. 258 to indemnify an innocent victim are i) where the insured did
    not consent to the motor vehicle being operated and ii) where a policy does
    not exist due to cancellation prior to the date of loss.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further,
    CAA submits that given the legislative intent demonstrated generally under
    the <i>Insurance Act</i> to define liability coverage broadly, s. 258(1)
    should be interpreted to provide compensation to innocent third parties,
    even if coverage is not provided as between the insured and the insurer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
      do not accept CAA’s submissions. In our view, the motion judge was correct
      in holding that there can be no recovery by a third party beneficiary under
      s. 258(1) unless the insured could have been entitled to recover under
      a </span>motor vehicle liability policy<span lang=EN-US> and that s. 258(4)
      and (5) apply only after the possibility of indemnity to the insured has
      been established. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      a plain reading of s. 258(1), it is triggered only when a person <i>has
      a claim</i> against an insured <i>for which indemnity is provided</i> by
      a motor vehicle policy [emphasis added]. Where, as here, the policy does
      not provide coverage for the claim that is advanced, there is no possibility
      of indemnity. Accordingly, on the plain language of s. 258(1), the section
      does not apply. It is only once a possibility of indemnity is found to
      exist, because there is a claim for which indemnity is provided under a
      motor vehicle policy, that s. 258(1) is triggered. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      our view, there is nothing inconsistent in these reasons with the cases
      on which the appellant relies. Those cases did not address the effect of
      the scope of the insuring agreement, <i>i.e.</i> the coverage issue, on
      the operation of s. 258(1). </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Moreover,
      in our view, the motion judge was correct in his interpretation of <i>Joachin</i>,
      in which this court said, “the word
    “indemnity” in s. 258(1) is used not to create a precondition but as part
    of a description.” </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      motion judge observed that the effect of <i>Joachin</i> is to recognize
      that “‘indemnity’ in s. 258(1) is descriptive of when the third party beneficiary
      has a claim but the indemnity itself does not have to exist.”
    As was stated in <i>Joachin</i>, the descriptive class of persons for whom
    s. 258(1) operates is persons “with claims …for which indemnity is provided
    by a contract evidenced by a motor vehicle policy.” In <i>Joachin</i>, the
    court also observed that it is unnecessary that the indemnity be enforceable
    for s. 258(1) to apply. In our view, the reasoning in <i>Joachin </i>is entirely
    consistent with our conclusion concerning the proper interpretation of s.
    258(1).</span></p>

    on the foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed. In accordance with the
    agreement of the parties, costs of the appeal are to the respondent on a
    partial indemnity basis fixed at $5,000 inclusive of disbursements and applicable
