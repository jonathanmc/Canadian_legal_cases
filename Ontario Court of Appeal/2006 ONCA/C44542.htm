style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2004, Ms. Blackman brought a motion to require Mr. Bodnar to pay arrears
    of support and to vary the 1993 order to reflect an increase in Mr. Bodnar’s
    income.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion was heard by Kunnas J.  He granted the motion in a judgment dated
    January 5, 2005, and ordered Mr. Bodnar to pay, among other things: child
    support for two children in the amount of $1,085.00 per month from September
    1, 2003, to May 1, 2004; and, from June 1, 2004, onwards, to pay child support
    of $702 per month for one child.  The reasons given by the motion judge for
    ordering those sums of child support are set out in full below.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Based on an income of $104,375, the applicant [Mr.
    Bodnar] will pay child support for two children to the respondent [Ms. Blackman]
    in the amount of $1,085 per month commencing on 1 September, 2003 and first
    of [each] month to and including the first of May, 2004.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As Christopher was thereafter not attending school
    on a full-time basis, his child support ceases to recommence in September
    2005 if he remains in the primary care of the respondent and attends full
    time.  Commencing on 1 June 2004 and [the] first of [each] month based on
    an income for 2004 in the amount of $104, 375, the applicant will pay child
    support for one child to the respondent in the amount of $702 per month until
    further order of the court on the premise that the child Ashley is a full-time
    student residing primarily with the respondent.  This is assumed and accepted
    as being the fact when she is attending Humber College at this time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Bodnar appealed.  A number of matters were argued on appeal.  Apart from
    a very minor agreed-upon change to the calculation of s.&nbsp;7 expenses,
    by judgment dated October 31, 2005, Platana&nbsp;J. dismissed that appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Bodnar again appeals.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the purposes of this appeal, two aspects of the reasons of the appeal court
    judge are significant.  The first is his determination that, as the motion
    judge did not order the amount required by the Federal Child Support Guidelines,
    SOR/97-175 (“Guideline support”), the motion judge must have acted pursuant
    to s. 3(2)(b) of the <i>Guidelines</i> when setting child support.  Second,
    he held that the motion judge adequately considered the factors necessary
    for a determination of the amount of child support pursuant to s. 3(2)(b).  Specifically,
    he was satisfied that the motion judge had considered: the circumstances
    of the children, including their incomes and need to contribute to their
    expenses; the children’s dependence on their parents; and, which child was
    residing with which parent at any point in time.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I am of the view that the appeal should succeed
    and the matter of child support payable pursuant to s. 3(2)(b) be remitted
    for a fresh hearing.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    the appellant’s factum raises a number of questions about the amount of child
    support he has been ordered to pay, at the oral hearing of the appeal, counsel
    for Mr. Bodnar indicated that the primary challenge is to the child support
    ordered pursuant to s. 3(2)(b).  Two matters must be addressed<span
lang=EN-US> in that regard.  Did the appeal court judge err in finding that the
    motion judge:</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>(1)       gave adequate reasons for the quantum of child support ordered
      pursuant to s.&nbsp;3(2)(b) of the <i>Guidelines</i>?</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;

lang=EN-US>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>considered
      the relevant factors pursuant to s.&nbsp;3(2)(b)?</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE ADEQUACY OF REASONS OF
      THE MOTION JUDGE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    requirement that a judge give reasons for decision is clear.  It is an inherent
    aspect of the discharge of a judge’s responsibilities.  See <i>R. v. Sheppard</i> (2001),
    162 C.C.C. (3d) 298 (S.C.C.).  As Binnie J. noted at para. 24 of <i>Sheppard</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he requirement of reasons is tied to their purpose
    and the purpose varies with the context.  At the trial level, the reasons
    justify and explain the result.  The losing party knows why he or she has
    lost.  Informed consideration can be given to grounds for appeal.  Interested
    members of the public can satisfy themselves that justice has been done,
    or not, as the case may be.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      need for reasons in the family law context was recently affirmed by this
      court in <i>Young v. Young </i>(2003), 63 O.R. (3d) 112.  At para. 27 of <i>Young</i>,
      Laskin J.A., writing for the court, states:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The desirability of reasoned reasons
      in a criminal case rests on three main rationales: public confidence in
      the administration of the justice system, the importance of telling the
      losing party the reasons for having lost, and making the right of appeal
      meaningful.  These three rationales also apply to a family law case and
      are relevant in this case.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      adequacy of reasons is to be decided on a functional approach; the reviewing
      court must ask itself whether the reasons meet the three rationales.  On
      that approach, in my view, the reasons of the motion judge are inadequate.<a href="#_ftn2"

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

      appellant seeks to challenge the order requiring him to pay the respondent
      child support of $1085 per month for the two adult children of the marriage,
      while they are full time students, and $702 per month if only one of the
      children is a full time student.  In assessing the adequacy of the reasons,
      it is important to keep in mind the legislative provision under which the
      motion judge acted in setting child support.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section
      3(2) of the Guidelines reads as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Child the age of majority or over</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless otherwise provided under
    these Guidelines, where a child to whom a child support order relates is
    the age of majority or over, the amount of the child support order is</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;&nbsp;the amount determined by
    applying these Guidelines as if the child were under the age of majority;

    the child. <span lang=EN-US>   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
      the appeal court judge correctly held, the order for child support was
      made pursuant to s. 3(2)(b) of the Guidelines, not s. 3(2)(a).  Had child
      support been ordered pursuant to s. 3(2)(a) of the Guidelines, a bald statement
      as to the amount of child support to be paid would be sufficient.  That
      is because child support ordered pursuant to s. 3(2)(a) is based on income
      and there is no discretion involved in setting the amount.  Once the motion
      judge determined Mr. Bodnar’s income, had he been acting pursuant to s.
      3(2)(a), he needed only to refer to the Table to determine the amount of
      child support to be paid.  In such a situation, he would not have needed
      to give reasons for the amount ordered as it would have been implicit that
      the amount had been determined by reference to the Table.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However,
      the motion judge was not acting pursuant to s. 3(2)(a).  He exercised his
      discretion and set the amount of child support pursuant to s. 3(2)(b).  As
      the motion judge gives no indication in his reasons as to how he arrived
      at the amount of child support, the appellant is unable to meaningfully
      challenge the order.  He simply does not know why the amount that was ordered
      was chosen as the appropriate figure for child support.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      motion judge articulated neither the law nor the evidence relied on in
      setting the amount.  Thus, the basis for the exercise of the motion judge’s
      discretion in setting the amount is unclear.  Did he apply the right law?  What
      factors and evidence did he consider when setting the amount?  Did he set
      the amount primarily on the basis of the Guideline amount, given the appellant’s
      income, with a small discount?  If so, did he err in principle?  Does the
      amount of s. 3(2)(b) child support payable to the respondent take into
      consideration the appellant’s obligation to contribute towards the children’s
      s. 7 living expenses while living away from home?  If so, does the order
      require the appellant to pay twice for the children’s living expenses?  Is
      the quantum of child support related to the costs that the respondent incurs
      by virtue of the children living with her when they are not attending post-secondary
      education?  If not, why not?  The motion judge gave some consideration
      to the children’s incomes in the context of s. 7 expenses but he did not
      relate their means and needs to the amount of support considered appropriate
      under s. 3(2)(b), as required by that provision.  The reasons say nothing
      about the financial ability of each parent to contribute to the support
      of the children, a matter which s. 3(2)(b) also requires the court to have
      regard to when setting child support under that provision.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There
      are no reasons given for the amount of child support ordered so there are
      no answers to these questions.  Thus, the appellant is prevented from meaningfully
      challenging the amounts he has been ordered to pay and this court is prevented
      from meaningfully reviewing the order.  In a matter involving the exercise
      of discretion, when a judge makes an order without giving reasons, an appellate
      court has no access to the reasoning underlying the determination and so
      cannot afford it deference.      </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    will be apparent that I disagree with the appeal court judge’s determination
    that the motion judge properly considered the relevant factors in setting
    support pursuant to s. 3(2)(b).  I accept the appeal court judge’s view that
    the motion judge considered the children’s dependence on their parents.  However,
    that finding goes to the question of whether the children remain “children
    of the marriage”, rather than the setting of child support.  I also accept
    that the appeal court judge was correct when he held that the motion judge
    made findings about which child resided where and at what times.  However,
    such determinations, in my view, do not constitute the required consideration
    of the circumstances of the children for the purposes of establishing the
    level of support owed by the appellant to the respondent for the purposes
    of s. 3(2)(b).  In any event, even if they did, they are insufficient as
    a consideration of the children’s circumstances does not encompass a consideration
    of the parties’ respective financial positions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    fairness to both the appeal court judge and the motion judge, it must be
    pointed out that they did not have the benefit of this court’s recent decision
    in <i>Lewi v. Lewi</i>, [2006] O.J. No. 1847, when deciding the matter.  <i>Lewi </i>addresses
    the difficult questions posed in setting child support pursuant to ss. 3(2)(b)
    and 7 of the Guidelines and offers guidance on the factors to be considered
    when setting such support.          </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>I
      wish to add that I am sympathetic to the demands on motion court judges.  They
      almost inevitably face lengthy dockets every day of the week.  Most, if
      not all, of the matters they hear are urgent and need to be decided quickly.  All
      of the matters are important to the parties.  As in the present case, the
      motion judge is usually called on to decide a number of interrelated issues
      in any given case, issues which often involve conflicting and incomplete
      evidence.  All of these factors make the writing of timely reasons a real
      challenge.  </span></p>

'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>I
      would reiterate the recent comments of this court in <i>R. v. Tzarfin</i>,
      [2005] O.J. No. 3531 at para. 9:   </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[A]ppellate courts must not place

  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>This sentiment
      applies equally to the reasons of motion judges, including those deciding
      family law matters.  Nonetheless, the appellant has been ordered to pay
      a substantial sum of money for a substantial period of time and he is entitled
      to know the basis for such an order. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>CHILD SUPPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION&nbsp;3(2)(b)

    3(2)(b) requires a court to set child support based on the “condition, means,
    needs and other circumstances of” the children and “the financial ability
    of each spouse to contribute to the support of the child”.  Some of the considerations
    that are relevant when assessing the needs and means of the parties and children
    for the purposes of setting the amount of child support to be ordered pursuant
    to s.&nbsp;3(2)(b) are reflected in the questions posed in the foregoing
    section.  While the type and extent of information that is required will
    vary with the individual circumstances of each case, in this case, that section
    required due consideration of: the expenses associated with maintaining a
    home for children who live away while undertaking post&#8209;secondary education;
    the financial position of each of the parents; and the financial means and
    needs of the children.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

    is clear that the amount of support to be ordered pursuant to s. 3(2)(b)
    cannot be determined without findings of fact in relation to the needs and
    means of the parties and the children, including addressing the dual residences
    of the children while at university.  The requisite findings have not been
    made in this case and, on the record before this court, it is not possible
    to make them.  The evidence is conflicting and incomplete.  Consequently,

    said that, I would note that the <span lang=EN-US>motion judge refers only
    to the appellant’s income when setting child support under s. 3(2)(b).  Whereas
    income is the determinant of child support under s. 3(2)(a) and the “guiding
    principle” in setting child support under s. 7, s. 3(2)(b) calls for a consideration
    of the means and needs of the parties and the children.  Absent special circumstances,
    to set the amount of child support based primarily on a single factor (<i>i.e. </i>the
    income of one party) would be an error in principle as it runs contrary to
    the terms of s. 3(2)(b).     </span>       </p>
