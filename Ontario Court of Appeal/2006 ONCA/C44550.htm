    1997, Mr. Johnston sued Shell and claimed damages for Shell’s alleged failure
    to properly investigate and remediate petroleum hydrocarbon contamination
    on the property. In 2001, Mr. Johnston and Shell entered into Minutes of
    Settlement addressing Shell’s remediation obligations. At issue in this case
    is the proper interpretation of a requirement in the Minutes of Settlement
    that Shell conduct “appropriate further testing” of Mr. Johnston’s property. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    of what was “appropriate further testing” to an environmental consulting
    company, Golder &amp; Associates, and that Shell had met its obligations
    under the Minutes. The appellant disputes these findings on appeal. For the
    reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>

'><b>Background</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    April 1990, Mr. Johnston purchased 82 Main Street, Warkworth, together with
    a service station business operating at that address (collectively the “Property”).
    At the time of this purchase, the appellant was aware that, since 1940, the
    Property had been the site of a gasoline service station business operating
    under Shell’s name (or that of its corporate predecessor, White Rose). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the purchase, Mr. Johnston carried on a service station business on the Property
    under Shell’s name until October 1994. Although he owned and operated the
    business, Shell owned the gasoline and gasoline handling equipment on the
    Property, including fuel pumps and underground fuel storage tanks.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    October 1994, Mr. Johnston and Shell discontinued their relationship. As
    a result, with the assistance of a consultant, Shell began decommissioning
    the Property by removing the existing gasoline handling equipment and cleaning
    up hydrocarbon contamination. However, in 1995, Shell’s environmental consultant,
    Central Projects Group Inc., raised concerns that there could be underground
    fuel storage tanks beneath an office now located on part of the Property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time that the decommissioning process began, the Ministry of the Environment
    had issued Interim Guidelines for the Assessment and Management of Petroleum
    Sites in Ontario (the “Interim Guidelines”). Decommissioning of the Property
    was delayed because of various disputes between the parties. In early 1996,
    Shell’s consultant reported that soil samples taken from an area underneath
    the office located on the Property contained concentrations of petroleum-related
    hydrocarbons that exceeded the permissible limits established by the Interim
    Guidelines.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    receiving the consultant’s report, the parties discussed remediation of that
    part of the Property situated under the office but they were unable to reach
    an agreement. In the meantime, effective July 1, 1996, the Interim Guidelines
    were replaced by the Final Guideline for Use at Contaminated Sites in Ontario
    (the “Guideline”). In the light of that development, Shell asked its consultant
    to reassess the data previously collected in relation to the Property. In
    December 1996, the consultant reported that the existing soil samples met
    the new remediation criteria set forth in the Guideline. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    July 8, 1997, Mr. Johnston commenced this action, claiming damages for Shell’s
    failure to properly investigate and remediate the Property. In due course,
    a trial was scheduled for April 2001. However, on April 6, 2001, Mr. Johnston
    brought a motion seeking leave to deliver an expert report from Oakridge
    Environmental Limited (the “Oakridge report”) concerning the environmental
    status of the Property. Because of the timing of that request, the trial
    was adjourned to October 2001. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Oakridge
    did not conduct its own tests on the Property; rather, it critiqued the expert
    reports that had been prepared previously in connection with the Property.
    Based on Oakridge’s comments, it was apparent that there were at least three
    areas of dispute between the parties: i) whether the Property should be classified
    as residential or commercial/industrial; ii) whether the Property should
    be assessed under Table A or Table B of the Guideline; and iii) having regard
    to items i) and ii), whether the Property had been remediated in accordance
    with the applicable standards. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly
    before the October 2001 trial date, the parties entered into Minutes of Settlement,
    which included the following terms:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>THE PARTIES
    HEREBY AGREE AS FOLLOWS:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>1. Shell shall
    conduct, at its own expense, appropriate further testing of the Johnston
    property situate within Warkworth.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>2. Shell shall
    retain Golder &amp; Associates who shall be acknowledged and agreed as the
    acceptable consultant to conduct the testing referenced in paragraph 1.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>3. Golder shall
    make all inquiries and make all determinations it deems necessary regarding
    the application of the Ministry of the Environment guidelines for use at
    contaminated sites in Ontario and Table A or B of the generic criteria of
    those guidelines. The property shall be considered as a commercial use. Golder
    shall be permitted to make its own professional determination of the appropriate
    table. However, the same shall be subject to reasonable review by the parties
    and their experts.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>4. Shell undertakes
    to remediate the property in an appropriate manner, if same is required,
    arising out of the Golder testing and investigation. The scope and nature
    of any remediation will have to be determined by the results obtained by
    Golder and will be the subject of further discussions between the parties.
    It is understood by the parties that if the property meets the applicable
    guideline generic criteria, no remediation shall be required…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>6. The testing,
    evaluation of the site, and any remediation shall be all undertaken with
    reasonable diligence and within a reasonable time save and except matters
    that are not within the control of the participants.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    accordance with the Minutes of Settlement, Shell retained Golder to proceed
    with the required work. In a letter dated November 1, 2001 (the “retainer
    letter”), counsel for Shell provided Golder with the following instructions
    concerning the work to be performed:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>More specifically,
    it was agreed that Golder Associates would provide its opinion as to whether
    i) the Property should be classified under Table A or Table B of the guidelines;
    and ii) whether the Property currently meets the criteria under whichever
    of the tables is selected. <i>In either case, the Property should be classified
    as “commercial” for purposes of the guidelines. In reaching its opinion,
    Golder shall be free to conduct such further testing on the Property as it
    decides is necessary to determine whether the Property does or does not meet
    the appropriate guideline criteria  </i>[emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shell’s
    counsel sent a copy of the retainer letter to counsel for Mr. Johnston, who
    made no comments in response.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    May 21, 2002, Golder issued a report addressed to counsel for both parties.
    In its report, Golder concluded that the Table B generic criteria applicable
    to non-potable groundwater and coarse textured soils for commercial/industrial
    land use are the appropriate criteria against which to assess the environmental
    quality of the Property. Further, based on groundwater testing that it conducted
    near the site where Shell had removed the gas pumps and on the soil testing
    previously performed by Shell’s consultant, Golder concluded that the Property
    meets the Table B Guideline criteria.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    an affidavit filed in support of his motion to enforce the Minutes of Settlement,
    Mr. Johnston deposed that when Golder representatives attended at the Property
    to do their investigation, he showed them historical photographs of the White
    Rose service station premises that depicted gasoline handling equipment in
    the area of what is now the office, and asked the Golder representatives
    to conduct groundwater testing in that area. Mr. Johnston also stated, “For
    reasons unknown to me, Golder’s representatives refused to do so.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    receiving the Golder report, Shell’s counsel wrote to Mr. Johnston’s counsel
    on May 23, 2002, and stated, “consistent with paragraph 4 of the minutes
    of settlement, Shell shall not be conducting any further remediation on your
    client’s property”. Shell’s counsel received no response to his May 23, 2002
    letter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    March 17, 2004, new counsel for Mr. Johnston wrote to Golder, enclosed a
    report from Cardinal Environmental Services Consulting Limited dated October
    2003, and asked whether Golder remained of the view that the Property complies
    with Table B of the Guideline. In its report, Cardinal expressed the following
    conclusions:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>soil

    office located on the Property contain concentrations of hydrocarbons exceeding

    concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons were identified in a groundwater
    sample taken from beneath a portion of the office located on the Property.
    The concentrations were below the Table B criteria for applicable parameters
    (Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, and Xylene). </p>

line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Golder
    did not answer the March 17, 2004 letter. However, in a letter dated March
    23, 2004, Shell’s counsel responded that the matter had been settled for
    nearly two years and that there was no basis for the request by Mr. Johnston’s
    counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    May 19, 2004, Mr. Johnston’s counsel wrote to the Ministry of the Environment
    and asked various questions concerning the Golder report and inquired whether,
    in the Ministry’s view, the Property complies with the Guideline. A response
    from the Ministry dated August 20, 2004, includes the following statements:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    filed an expert’s report addressing the quality of testing that had been
    done on the Property.</p>

    his reasons, the motion judge noted that Golder was retained at the request
    of Mr. Johnston, that Golder had identified the appropriate standard for
    evaluating the Property, and that it was satisfied that the appropriate standard
    had been met. While recognizing that Mr. Johnston had filed a consultant’s
    report suggesting that the standard had not been met, the motion judge concluded
    that the Minutes of Settlement were unambiguous in establishing a regime
    under which Golder would look at the existing test results, conduct further
    tests, and arrive at an opinion as to whether further remediation was required.
    The motion judge concluded, “They also conducted further tests. It seems,
    therefore, when we consider the Minutes of Settlement as a whole, the appropriate
    standards as required by the Minutes of Settlement, have been met and that,
    notwithstanding the subsequent report as to hydrocarbons, Shell has met its
    obligations under the Minutes of Settlement.”</p>

    Mr. Johnston’s submission that Golder had failed to conduct additional tests
    in the area of the office, the motion judge said it was undisputed that Golder
    had the previous test results from that area. He said that Mr. Johnston was
    aware that the previous test results suggested that hydrocarbons were present
    in that area and that Mr. Johnston had signed the Minutes of Settlement “without,
    apparently, adverting to the necessity of further testing at this place”.</p>

line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    main issue on appeal is whether the motion judge erred in interpreting the
    Minutes of Settlement as delegating to Golder the authority to determine
    the  “appropriate further testing” to be performed under para. 1 of the Minutes
    of Settlement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    particular, Mr. Johnston contends that because the Minutes of Settlement
    were signed following several years of disagreement regarding the level of
    contamination under the office and what should be done about it, the Minutes
    can only properly be read as imposing an absolute obligation on Shell to
    conduct testing that is appropriate in accordance with an objective standard.
    Given that Cardinal’s testing demonstrates that the Property does not comply
    with Table B of the Ministry Guideline, Mr. Johnston maintains that Shell
    has not complied with its testing obligation under the Minutes of Settlement
    and should be ordered to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Johnston submits that an interpretation of the Minutes of Settlement that
    would allow Shell, as the polluter, to walk away from the Property without
    conducting that appropriate testing and remediation is absurd. Moreover,
    he submits, such an interpretation would ignore the difference in wording
    between paras. 1 and 3 of the Minutes of Settlement. Whereas para. 3 contains
    an explicit delegation to Golder of the authority to determine whether Table
    A or B of the Guideline applies, para. 1 contains no such delegation. Rather,
    it imposes on Shell alone the obligation to conduct appropriate testing on
    the property. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept Mr. Johnston’s submissions. I conclude, for two reasons, that
    the motion judge made no error in holding that the Minutes of Settlement
    delegate to Golder the authority to determine the “appropriate further testing” to
    be conducted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    in my view, it is necessary to read the Minutes of Settlement as a whole
    to determine the scope of Shell’s obligation to conduct further tests. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    para. 1 imposes an obligation on Shell to conduct appropriate further testing,
    para. 2 requires Shell to retain Golder to conduct the tests and para. 4
    stipulates that Shell will “remediate the property … if same is required,
    arising out of the Golder testing…” Para. 4 also states: “The scope and nature
    of any remediation will have to be determined by the results obtained by
    Golder and will be the subject of further discussions between the parties.”  Importantly,
    para. 4 further records the parties’ agreement that if the Property met the “applicable
    guideline generic criteria”, <u>as determined by Golder</u>, “no remediation
    shall be required”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Read
    as a whole, these provisions indicate that Shell’s obligation to remediate
    the Property is tied expressly to the results of the Golder testing. In accordance
    with para. 4, the parties agreed that the results of the Golder testing would
    determine both whether remediation was necessary, and, if it was, the scope
    and nature of the remediation to be performed. Significantly, while Shell
    bears the obligation to conduct appropriate testing, it has no right to perform
    any tests itself. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    these provisions, the nature of the issues between the parties at the time
    that the Minutes of Settlement were signed, and the fact that Golder was
    retained at the request of Mr. Johnston, a proper reading of the Minutes
    of Settlement indicates that Golder was named in para. 2 as the
    “acceptable consultant to conduct the testing” because Golder was to determine
    what further testing on the Property was appropriate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Second,
    contrary to Mr. Johnston’s submission, the language of para. 3 of the Minutes
    of Settlement does not undermine the conclusion that Golder was authorized
    to determine the further testing to be performed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    para. 3 explicitly delegates to Golder the authority to determine which Table
    of the Guideline applies to the Property, this authority is not absolute;
    to the contrary, it is “subject to reasonable review by the parties and their
    experts”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Significantly,
    however, this qualification does not apply to Golder’s determination of the
    testing to be performed. Thus, the purpose of para. 3 is to make clear that
    Golder’s authority to identify the appropriate standard for evaluating the
    Property is limited. But the fact that there is no reference in the Minutes
    of Settlement to anyone other than Golder having input into the further testing
    to be conducted, supports the conclusion that Golder alone is entitled to
    make that determination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on the foregoing factors, I am satisfied that the motion judge did not err
    in holding that the Minutes of Settlement delegate to Golder the authority
    to determine the appropriate further testing to be conducted on the Property
    and, consequently, whether further remediation is necessary. Absent demonstration
    of a palpable and overriding error, the motion judge’s conclusion that Shell
    met its obligations under the Minutes of Settlement is entitled to deference
    in this court.</p>

line-height:normal'>[36]<span

    the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the appeal. Shell is entitled to its
    costs of the appeal, if demanded, on a partial indemnity basis fixed at $7,500,
    inclusive of disbursements and applicable G.S.T.  </p>
