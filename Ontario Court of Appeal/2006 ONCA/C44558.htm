  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant, Alvaro Malicia, was convicted – for the tenth time – of impaired
      driving.  At the time of the sentence hearing, he was serving a three and
      a half year sentence for his ninth conviction.  The sentencing judge, Epstein&nbsp;J.,
      imposed a sentence of four and a half years imprisonment for the tenth
      conviction.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      sentencing judge did not say in her reasons, or endorse on the indictment
      or the warrant of committal, whether the four and a half year sentence
      was consecutive or concurrent to the three and a half year sentence.  When
      she was informed that the Crown and defence counsel were concerned about
      this omission, the sentencing judge convened a hearing two days after rendering
      her initial reasons.  She heard submissions from counsel, including defence
      counsel’s submission that once she endorsed the indictment she became <i>functus
      officio</i> and, therefore, by operation of law the sentences were to be
      served concurrently.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      sentencing judge did not accept defence counsel’s <i>functus officio</i> argument.  She
      stated: “It was always my intention that the sentence be consecutive to
      that served.”  She imposed a sentence of four and a half years consecutive
      to the three and a half years already being served by the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      appellant appeals his sentence.  The principal issue on the appeal is whether
      the sentencing judge erred in her understanding and application of the <i>functus
      officio</i> doctrine.  A second issue, contingent on the resolution of
      the <i>functus officio</i> issue, relates to the totality of the appellant’s
      sentences.</span></p>

      April&nbsp;5,&nbsp;2002, the appellant was on bail awaiting sentencing
      for his ninth impaired driving conviction.  In the middle of the night,
      the appellant drove his van at high speed on Christie Avenue in Toronto.  He
      crossed three lanes of traffic and crashed into another car.  The car was
      demolished and its driver rendered unconscious.  The appellant was pulled
      from his van, which was on fire.  Luckily, neither the appellant nor the
      other driver was seriously injured.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant was charged with impaired driving, failing to provide a breath
      sample, and dangerous driving.  On July&nbsp;16,&nbsp;2004, the trial judge
      convicted the appellant of impaired driving and dangerous driving<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a> and
      acquitted him on the count of failing to provide a breath sample.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A
      comprehensive sentencing hearing, including testimony from the appellant
      and eight other witnesses, took place on January&nbsp;10&nbsp;and&nbsp;14,&nbsp;2005.  On
      January&nbsp;19,&nbsp;2005, the sentencing judge imposed a sentence of
      four and a half years for impaired driving and six months concurrent for
      dangerous driving.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Shortly
      after the sentencing hearing, counsel encountered each other in the courthouse
      hallway.  They discussed the reasons for sentence, and in particular whether
      the sentencing judge had ordered that the sentence be served consecutive
      to the three and a half year sentence the appellant was already serving
      for his ninth conviction for impaired driving.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Both
      counsel went to the court office and asked the registrar for clarification
      about the sentence.  The registrar informed them that the warrant of committal
      had already been signed and sent to the prison, and that it said nothing
      about whether the sentence imposed was consecutive to the appellant’s existing
      sentence.  The indictment had also been signed by this point, without reference
      to whether the sentence was to be served consecutively.  After consulting
      with the trial judge, the registrar issued an amended warrant of committal
      on January&nbsp;20 indicating that the sentence was consecutive to the
      sentence the appellant was already serving.  The appellant was ordered
      to appear before the trial judge on January</span>&nbsp;21 for clarification
      of the sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant and both counsel appeared before the sentencing judge on January&nbsp;21.  Defence
    counsel submitted that the judge was <i>functus officio</i> and could not
    alter the sentence that she had imposed.  Crown counsel argued that it was
    implicit in the sentencing judge’s reasons that the sentence was to be consecutive
    and that the sentencing judge had jurisdiction to clarify her reasons for
    sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    sentencing judge then delivered these reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I regret the fact that you had to come back simply
    because of an omission in the wording of my reasons for sentencing, Mr.&nbsp;Malicia.  It
    was always my intention that the sentence be consecutive to that served.  And,
    it was, I agree with Ms.&nbsp;Humphrey that it was implicit in my reasons,
    particularly the section having to do with the merger of the two sentences,
    and there were no submissions made with respect to the possibility that this
    would run concurrently, and it was never my intention it would be so.  I
    don’t consider myself <i>functus</i>.  I consider the sentence to have been
    clear in its intention, although not as clear as it might have been in its
    wording.  So the sentence of four&#8209;and&#8209;a&#8209;half years is consecutive
    to the sentence now being served.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In <i>Doucet&#8209;Boudreau
        v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Education)</i>, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 3 at paras.&nbsp;77
        and 79, Iacobucci and Arbour JJ. discussed the definition of, and rationale
        for, the doctrine of <i>functus officio</i>:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The <i>Oxford Companion to Law</i> (1980),
      at p.&nbsp;508, provides the following definition:</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><i><span lang=EN-US>Functus officio</span></i><span lang=EN-US> (having
      performed his function).  Used of an agent who has performed his task and
      exhausted his authority and of an arbitrator or judge to whom further resort
      is incompetent, his function being exhausted.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN-US>. . .</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>It is clear that the principle
      of <i>functus officio</i> exists to allow finality of judgments from courts
      which are subject to appeal (see also <i>Reekie v. Messervey</i>, [1990]
      1 S.C.R. 219, at pp.&nbsp;222&#8209;23).  This makes sense:  if the court
      could continually hear applications to vary its decisions, it would assume
      the function of an appellate court and deny litigants a stable base from
      which to launch an appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once
    the doctrine of <i>functus officio</i> is acknowledged, the crucial question
    becomes: “how can we know when a judge’s function is exhausted?”: see <i>Doucet&#8209;Boudreau</i> at
    para.&nbsp;78.  In civil cases, the longstanding answer has been when the
    judgment is drawn up and entered: see <i>Paper Machinery Ltd. v. J.D. Ross
    Engineering Corp</i>., [1934] S.C.R. 186.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the general line drawn in civil cases has not been an absolute one.  There
    have been two exceptions, as explained by Rinfret&nbsp;J. in <i>Paper Machinery</i> at
    p.&nbsp;188:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The question really is therefore whether there
    is power in the court to amend a judgment which has been drawn up and entered.  In
    such a case, the rule followed in England is, we think, – and we see no reason
    why it should not be followed by this Court – that there is no power to amend
    a judgment which has been drawn up and entered, except in two cases: (1)&nbsp;Where
    there has been a slip in drawing it up, or (2)&nbsp;Where there has been
    error in expressing the manifest intention of the court….</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Interestingly,
    in criminal cases the courts, including until recently the Supreme Court
    of Canada, have drawn a sharper or less flexible line.  Thus, in jury cases,
    the judge becomes <i>functus officio</i> when the judge discharges the jury:
    see <i>Head v. The Queen</i>, [1986] 2 S.C.R.&nbsp;684.  In judge alone cases,
    the point of no return is after the trial judge endorses the indictment:
    see, for example, <i>R. v. Roberts</i>, [2004] B.C.J. No.&nbsp;1843 (C.A.)
    and <i>R. v. J.S.P.</i>, [1997] A.J. No. 160 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant especially relies on <i>J.S.P</i>.  The facts of that case and
    the Alberta Court of Appeal’s disposition are set out at paras.&nbsp;3&#8209;4
    of Hunt&nbsp;J.A.’s endorsement:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The sentencing judge imposed a sentence of 18&nbsp;months
    secure custody without specifying whether that sentence was to be served
    concurrently to the other sentences that were being served, or whether it
    was to be served consecutively.  The following day, she arranged to have
    counsel called back and clarified that she meant these sentences to be served
    consecutively to the sentences that were being served.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Under the circumstances here, it is our view that
    the sentencing judge became functus once she imposed the sentence on October
    16.  Accordingly, she did not have jurisdiction on October 17 to specify
    that the sentence was to be served consecutively.  Thus, we grant leave to
    appeal and allow the appeal as to the first ground.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the appellant’s submission that the facts in this appeal are indistinguishable
    from those in <i>J.S.P.</i>  Accordingly, the relevant question is whether <i>J.S.P.</i>,
    and other similar cases such as <i>Roberts</i>, <i>supra</i>, should be followed.  The
    answer to this question turns, in my view, on a careful consideration of
    the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Burke</i> (2002),
    164 C.C.C. (3d) 385. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Burke</i>,
    I say immediately, is a jury case; this appeal relates to a judge alone trial.  I
    will need to return to this important difference later.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Burke</i>,
    like <i>Head</i> before it, involves the doctrine of <i>functus officio</i> in
    the context of a jury verdict.  In <i>Head</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada
    enunciated a bright line rule – if the jury has been discharged, the trial
    judge is <i>functus</i>; the judge cannot inquire into or change the jury’s
    verdict.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Burke</i>,
    the court rejected the rule in <i>Head</i>.  Justice&nbsp;Major regarded
    it as too strict.  He said at paras.&nbsp;46&#8209;48:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my opinion, the common law rule in <i>Head</i> must
    be reformulated.  Otherwise, apparent absurdities might result.  For instance,
    where the error in recording the verdict is discovered immediately after
    the discharge of the jury but before the jurors have left the jury box, <i>Head</i> would

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I do not think that result can be right.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>To the contrary, the administration of justice
    would be brought into disrepute by barring the court from correcting a recorded
    verdict where there is no perceptible injustice to the accused and no reasonable
    apprehension of bias.</p>

    declared that “a more refined and flexible analysis of this sort of problem” (para.&nbsp;51)
    was called for and pointed to the United Kingdom where the law had evolved
    to permit the clarification of a verdict in rare circumstances after the
    jury has been discharged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice&nbsp;Major
    proceeded to articulate a new test, the essentials of which are set out in
    paras.&nbsp;52 and 54:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[A]lthough <i>Head</i> forms the general rule that
    prohibits changes to a criminal verdict post&#8209;discharge, we would not
    foreclosure the possibility of a limited and exceptional jurisdiction remaining
    with the trial judge to recall the jury for the purposes of inquiring into
    the alleged error, which may result in correction of the recorded verdict.  The
    question then is under what circumstances should this jurisdiction be exercised.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is only where the error does not engage the
    deliberations of the jury that the exceptional jurisdiction may be exercised.  It
    is unwise to characterize these types of errors as “clerical errors” or “accidental
    slips”, given the vague meaning of these terms.  “Clerical errors” or “accidental
    slips”, as those terms are commonly understood, are administrative and may
    be corrected by the judge without recalling the jury:…<i>Chandler v. Alberta
    Association of Architects</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 848….These slips would be
    minor, such as correcting dates and duties of a similar nature.  However,
    the error in the present appeal and similar cases necessitates a recall of
    the jury in order to confirm the true and unanimous verdict and the discrepancy
    with the announced and recorded verdict.  Therefore, rather than use the
    label “clerical error”, it is preferable to say that <i>the exceptional post&#8209;discharge
    jurisdiction can only be exercised where the correction of the error</i>,
    although it requires the presence of the jury, <i>does not require the jury
    to reconsider its verdict or complete its deliberations with a view to handing
    down additional verdicts</i> [emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After <i>Burke</i>,
    the relevant question in this appeal is whether the exception to the <i>functus
    officio</i> doctrine enunciated in <i>Burke</i> – namely, correction of the
    error should be permitted if it does not require the jury to reconsider its
    verdict – should be imported into judge alone criminal trials, including
    the sentence components of those trials.  In my view, there is no principled
    basis for refusing to make this linkage.  I say this for two reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    one of the values of <i>Burke</i>, although not remarked upon in Major&nbsp;J.’s
    judgment, is that it creates a desirable symmetry between civil and criminal
    trials in this domain.  In civil cases, <i>Paper Machinery</i> established
    an exception to the application of the <i>functus officio</i> doctrine if
    there had been an error in expressing the manifest intention of the court.  In
    criminal cases, pre&#8209;<i>Burke</i>, there was no such principled exception.  Rather,
    cases like <i>Head</i> enunciated bright line rules – was the jury discharged?  was
    the indictment endorsed? – which conclusively triggered a finding of <i>functus
    officio</i>.  <i>Burke</i> changes this and insists on a
    “more refined and flexible analysis”.  A crucial component, indeed the linchpin,
    of the new analysis is whether the potential correction of an error involves
    reconsideration by the jury of its verdict; if it does, then the doctrine
    of <i>functus officio</i> prevents correction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, this is very close to the focus mandated by <i>Paper Machinery</i>,
    namely, ascertainment of the manifest intention of the court.  Both <i>Burke</i> and <i>Paper
    Machinery</i> permit an inquiry directed toward what a judge or jury intended
    to say, and in fact said, but without permitting the judge or jury to reconsider
    and possibly change the verdict.  Against the backdrop of this expanded symmetry
    in the case law, I cannot see any principled reason to prohibit a similar
    inquiry in a judge alone criminal case, including with respect to sentencing.  Retention
    of a bright line rule – no inquiry if the sentence has been endorsed on the
    indictment and/or warrant of committal – that would trump the principled
    inquiry set out in <i>Burke</i> and <i>Paper Machinery</i> makes no sense.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the policy rationale enunciated in <i>Burke</i> for permitting correction
    of errors in jury cases – namely, the administration of justice would be
    brought into disrepute if a court were barred from correcting a recorded
    verdict where there is no perceptible injustice to the accused and no reasonable
    apprehension of bias – is precisely the same in judge alone criminal trials.  A
    jury can make an error in recording a verdict; so can a judge.  The law for
    permitting (and refusing to permit) corrections of errors should be, as much
    as possible, the same in both scenarios.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    turn then to the application of the <i>Burke</i> test (and, essentially,
    the <i>Paper Machinery</i> test as well) to what the sentencing judge did
    in this case.  The question is: did her decision on January&nbsp;21,&nbsp;2005
    to clarify that the sentence she had imposed two days earlier was to be served
    consecutive to the sentence the appellant was already serving amount to an
    impermissible reconsideration and alteration of the January&nbsp;19 sentence?  In
    my view, it clearly did not.  I say this for two reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    and most importantly, the sentencing judge said that
    “[i]t was always my intention that the sentence be consecutive to that served.”  The
    sentencing judge is in the best position to know what she intended.  When
    she explicitly declares her intention (especially where, as here, the declaration
    is made promptly after the pronouncement of sentence), her declaration should
    be accepted by an appellate court, absent something powerfully contrary in
    the record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the record in this case in fact strongly supports the sentencing judge’s
    statement.  Although there was nothing in her January&nbsp;19 reasons about
    the merger of the two sentences (contrary to the sentencing judge’s comment
    in her January&nbsp;21 reasons), the reality is that the sentencing submissions
    of both counsel and the dialogue between counsel and the judge make it crystal
    clear that everyone was on the same page – namely, the sentence imposed for
    the appellant’s tenth impaired driving offence would be consecutive to the
    sentence he was already serving for his ninth conviction for the same offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, I conclude that the sentencing judge did not err when she
    clarified that the sentence she had imposed on the appellant was consecutive
    to the sentence he was already serving.  In the circumstances of this case,
    the sentencing judge’s decision on January 21 did not constitute a reconsideration
    or alteration of the original sentence imposed.  To the contrary, it simply
    confirmed and clarified that sentence, consistent with the trial judge’s
    intention, the clear expectations of counsel, and the nature of the offence
    and the offender before the court.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(2)       <u>The totality issue</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      his rehabilitation.  I disagree.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge was well aware that the appellant was already serving a penitentiary
      sentence.  The submissions of both counsel were anchored in a shared understanding
      that any sentence imposed by the judge would be consecutive to the one
      he was already serving.  The dialogue between counsel and the judge reflected
      the same point of departure.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Moreover,
      on the merits, it is difficult to see how a four and a half year sentence
      for a tenth impaired driving conviction is excessive.  This court upheld
      the three and a half year sentence the appellant received for this ninth
      conviction.  The tenth offence took place when the appellant was on bail
      with respect to the previous offence.  The tenth offence was coupled with
      particularly terrible driving for which the appellant was convicted of
      dangerous driving.  It also involved an accident which destroyed another
      vehicle and rendered its driver unconscious.  Finally, it is clear that
      previous periods of incarceration have not deterred the appellant from
      drinking and driving.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      at this juncture, considerations of rehabilitation or sentences that might
      crush the appellant recede into almost complete insignificance.  The safety
      of other drivers and pedestrians is the paramount consideration.  The sentence
      of four and a half years for the tenth conviction is entirely fit.  It
      is still fit when served consecutive to the three and a half year sentence
      for the ninth offence.</span></p>

    have had the benefit of reading the reasons of my colleague MacPherson J.A.  On

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    in relation to the <i>functus officio</i> issue, I wish to say that while
    I agree generally with my colleague’s analysis, in my view, different considerations
    may inform the proper formulation of an exception to the <i>functus officio</i> doctrine
    in the context of criminal judge alone trials than are applicable in the
    context of criminal jury trials.  Accordingly, I would not foreclose the
    possibility that my colleague’s articulation of the exception to the <i>functus

    she subsequently clarified that the sentence was consecutive.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>B.        DISCUSSION </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    begin by noting that on my reading of both <i>Head v. The Queen</i>, [1986]
    2 S.C.R. 684 and <i>R. v. Burke</i> (2002), 164 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.),
    the Supreme Court of Canada has recognized that, in relation to doctrine
    of <i>functus officio</i>, “there are different policy considerations animating
    criminal law matters that are absent from civil matters”; moreover,
    “[t]hese different considerations may warrant a more stringent approach in
    the criminal law sphere.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Such
    considerations include the need to “recognize and protect both the interests
    of the state and the public, and the particular interest of the accused.”: <i>Head</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at 692).  In<i> Burke</i>, Major J. identified additional considerations
    applicable to criminal jury trials “animating the bright-line rule in <i>Head </i>”.  These
    included: “preserving the finality of the verdict and the certainty of the
    trial process; shielding jurors from post-trial harassment and promoting
    free and frank jury discussions by protecting the secrecy of their deliberations;
    and preventing the administration of justice from falling into disrepute
    by ensuring that the jury is not biased.”  (<i>Burke</i>, <i>supra</i>, at
    para. 44).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Burke</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at para. 47, Major J. went on to note that when an error is discovered rapidly  “after
    discharge but prior to the jury having separated or dispersed, many of the
    policy concerns supporting the rule in <i>Head</i> are not engaged.”  For
    example, he indicated that if the error is discovered immediately after discharge,
    finality of the verdict would not be a pressing concern.  Further, he stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>An immediate discovery of the error would mean
    that the accused and the court could not have been under the illusion of
    the incorrectly recorded verdict for very long.  An error made only in conveying
    or recording the verdict can be corrected without exposing the deliberations
    of the jury to undue scrutiny and subjecting them to the risk of post-trial
    harassment.  If the jury has not dispersed beyond the jury box, then there
    is no realistic possibility that outside influences have tainted the jury.  Thus,
    there is no danger to the administration of justice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    indicated by my colleague, at para. 48 of <i>Burke</i>, Major J. enunciated
    the policy rationale for permitting correction to errors in criminal jury
    cases as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> …the administration of justice would be brought
    into disrepute by barring the court from correcting a recorded verdict <i>where
    there is no perceptible injustice to the accused and no reasonable apprehension
    of bias</i> [emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    it is important to note that at the outset of his analysis in <i>Burke</i>,
    Major J. stated that, in the context of his reasons, he intended “bias” to
    be interchangeable with taint.  Accordingly, an alternate formulation of
    the policy justification would be--the administration of justice would be
    brought into disrepute if a court were barred from correcting a recorded
    verdict where there is no perceptible injustice to the accused and no reasonable
    apprehension of taint. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on this policy justification, Major J. went on to formulate a two-step test
    for applying an exception to the <i>functus officio</i> doctrine within the
    context of a criminal jury trial.  Step one involves inquiring into the nature
    of the alleged error, <i>i.e.</i>, determining whether the error requires
    reconsideration of the verdict--if reconsideration is required no correction
    is possible.  Where reconsideration of the verdict is not required, step
    two involves determining whether the remedial jurisdiction to correct the
    verdict should be exercised. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Within
    the context of a criminal jury trial, Major J. stated, at para. 60 of <i>Burke</i>,
    that the driving consideration informing the test for exercising the remedial
    jurisdiction should be “the fear of a tainted or biased jury, or the appearance
    of unfairness”.  Accordingly, he formulated step two of the test for applying
    an exception to the <i>functus officio</i> doctrine as “reasonable apprehension
    of bias”, with the essence of the test being the likelihood of a reasonable
    apprehension that the jury may have been tainted by outside influences.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    identifying this test, Major J. referred, at para. 60 of<i> Burke</i>, to
    the potential for exposure to outside contacts, and to the fact that an argument
    that a reasonable apprehension of bias exists becomes more convincing with
    the passage of time:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The appropriate cut-off point beyond which the
    verdict cannot be corrected is found in the rationale underlying the
    “dispersal” case law.  The reason for using dispersal as the outside limit
    is that once the jurors have dispersed, they are no longer functioning as
    a single, cohesive unit, and are exposed to outside contacts which may reasonably
    raise the apprehension of bias….Logically, if the jurors have left the controlled
    courtroom environment, then the more time that has passed between the announcement
    of the verdict and the reconvening of the jury, the more convincing the argument
    becomes for establishing a reasonable apprehension of bias. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I read my colleague’s reasons, in importing the <i>Burke</i> test into criminal
    judge alone cases, he has adopted step one of the test but not step two.  While
    I agree that in the context of judge alone criminal trials there is no realistic
    basis for concern that a judge will become influenced by outside contacts,
    I do not foreclose the possibility that other factors could raise a reasonable
    apprehension of taint. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    I do not foreclose the possibility that because of the inherent differences
    between criminal jury trials and criminal judge alone trials, different policy
    concerns should feature more prominently in formulating an appropriate test
    for exercising the remedial jurisdiction to correct a verdict.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Without
    commenting on whether it would raise a reasonable apprehension of taint,
    as an example, I would cite delay between the time of rendering a decision
    and the time of identifying an error as the type of circumstance that might
    be considered in the future.  Similarly, I would not foreclose the possibility
    that the fact that judges typically give reasons for their decisions might
    be a factor that could influence whether the remedial jurisdiction to correct
    a verdict in criminal judge alone trial should be exercised. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    already noted, in my opinion, on the facts of this case, there are no such
    considerations in play that militate against permitting the trial judge to
    correct the sentence that was imposed in this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    particular, counsel requested clarification from the court registrar of the
    sentence that was imposed very soon after the sentencing hearing was completed
    on January 19, 2005.  Subsequently, after consulting with the trial judge,
    the court registrar issued an amended warrant of committal on January 20,
    2005.  While it is not clear when exactly the issue was brought to the trial
    judge’s attention, it is apparent that it was within about a day of the delivery
    of her reasons for sentence.  Further, when court reconvened on January 21,
    2005, the trial judge was unequivocal in her statement of her original intention. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    even if reasonable apprehension of taint forms part of the test for determining
    when the remedial jurisdiction to correct a verdict may be exercised, there
    are no facts in this case that support such an apprehension.  Similarly,
    policy concerns for the finality of the verdict would not appear to be engaged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    I see no basis for a perception of unfairness to the accused.  During sentencing
    submissions there was no suggestion that the sentence imposed should be concurrent.  On
    the contrary, both counsel requested consecutive sentences--that was undoubtedly
    what the appellant expected.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    while the sentencing judge was not bound by the submissions of counsel and
    could have, had she deemed it appropriate, imposed a concurrent sentence
    in order to “jump” the most recent sentence and at the same time afford the
    appellant some consideration for health issues, her reasons give no indication
    that that was her intention. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    even if the appellant was under an “illusion” as to the true nature of the
    sentence because of the failure of the trial judge to utter the word “consecutive”,
    that impression was swiftly corrected: see <i>Burke</i>, <i>supra</i>, at
    para. 47. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, there is little practical difference for the appellant between what
    occurred here and what happens in cases where a sentencing judge reads what
    has been written on the indictment in open court before endorsing it and
    an error is caught at that time.  In the latter case, there is no issue that
    the sentencing judge has jurisdiction to correct the error.  As already noted,
    in my opinion, the sentencing judge did not err in this case when she clarified
    that the sentence she had imposed was consecutive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,

'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have read the reasons for judgment of my colleagues MacPherson and Simmons
    JJ.A. on this appeal.  For the reasons expressed by MacPherson J.A., I agree
    that leave to appeal sentence should be granted and the sentence appeal should
    be dismissed.  However, because I also agree with one important aspect of
    the reasons of Simmons J.A. not directly addressed by MacPherson J.A., I
    respectfully deliver these brief additional concurring reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with MacPherson J.A. that the law for permitting and refusing to permit
    error corrections should be the same in jury and judge alone criminal trials,
    to the extent possible.  But I also share Simmons J.A.’s view that the jurisdiction
    to correct errors in a criminal case is not unlimited and that different
    considerations governing its invocation may arise under both scenarios.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the applicable jurisprudence, I would describe the error correction jurisdiction
    in this fashion.  The jurisdiction to effect error corrections in jury and
    judge  alone criminal cases should be animated by the same controlling principles,
    including the same limitations.  In both situations, the exercise of the
    curative authority for error correction <span style='font-family:Symbol;

'>¾</span> encompassed by the “more refined and flexible analysis” mandated by <i>R.
    v. Burke</i> (2002), 164 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.) and referenced by MacPherson
    J.A. in his reasons <span
style='font-family:Symbol;"Times New Roman";'>¾</span> will be precluded where
    the proposed correction, in reality, is tantamount to a reconsideration of
    the verdict (or sentence).  Importantly, it will also be precluded where
    issues of unfairness or injustice to the accused or reasonable apprehension
    of bias arise.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    follows that in a proper case, as indicated by Simmons J.A., the passage
    of time between the pronouncement of a verdict (or sentence) and the identification
    of the error, or other factors, might so compromise the appearance or reality
    of trial fairness as to prevent correction of the error in the interests
    of justice.  The nature and import of such factors, in a given criminal case,
    may differ materially depending on whether the trial has been conducted by
    a judge and jury, or by a judge alone.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, however, as explained by my colleagues, such limiting considerations
    do not arise on the record before this court. Accordingly, while I would
    grant leave to appeal sentence, I would dismiss the sentence appeal.</p>
