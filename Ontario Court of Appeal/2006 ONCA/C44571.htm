style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants, a lawyer and law firm, appeal from a trial
    judgment finding them liable for breach of trust for paying monies out of their
    trust account without the authorization of the respondent, a client.  The appellants arranged a second mortgage in
    the amount of $75,000 on the home of the respondent as “collateral security
    that stood secondary” to a mortgage given by Liorti Developments Corp. (“LDC”),
    a company owned and controlled by the respondent’s children.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants received the loan proceeds, deposited them in
    the law firm’s trust account to the credit of LDC, and paid them out on the
    instructions of Peter Liorti, the respondent’s son and principal of LDC.  The trial judge found that the loan funds were
    advanced on the basis of the respondent’s mortgage as well as the LDC mortgage,
    that the law firm held those funds in trust for the respondent as well as LDC,
    and that no payments out of trust should have been made without the
    authorization or approval of the both parties.  The respondent did not approve or authorize the payments out of trust.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was satisfied that the respondent’s mortgage
    “was understood by all to be a collateral security that stood secondary to the
    LDC mortgage.”  The respondent had
    received independent legal advice as to that effect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We find the trial judge erred. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge indicated his view that the question was not
    whether the respondent’s $75,000 mortgage was primary or secondary.  He addressed the question whether the
    appellants received the loan funds in trust for both the respondent and LDC.
    His error was in not recognizing that the answer to the first question would
    determine the answer to the second.  The
    fact that the respondent’s mortgage was “collateral security that stood
    secondary to the LDC mortgage” meant that the loan funds were advanced to the
    primary borrower, LDC.  The
    consideration that the respondent received for giving the collateral mortgage
    was the advancing of funds to the primary borrower, her children’s
    company.  The law firm properly held the
    funds in trust for LDC and paid money out of trust as instructed by LDC’s
    principal.  There was no breach of
    trust.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is allowed, the trial judgment is set aside and
    replaced with an order dismissing the respondent’s action.  The cross-appeal for increased pre-judgment
    interest is dismissed.  The appellants
    are entitled to their costs at trial, which we fix in the amount of $8,000
    inclusive of disbursements in GST.  Costs of the appeal including the motion in the Court of Appeal of fixed
    in the amount of $12,000 inclusive of disbursements in GST. </p>
