  <p><strong>On appeal from the order of the Divisional Court (Justices John
      G. J. O’Driscoll, Peter G. Jarvis and Anne M. Molloy) dated May 13, 2005, </strong><strong>77
      O.R. (3d) 422 (Div. Ct.), allowing an appeal from the order of Justice
      Maurice Cullity, 63 O.R. (3d) 289 (S.C.J.), and certifying the action as
      a class proceeding pursuant to the <em>Class Proceedings Act, 1992</em>,
      S.O. 1992, c. 6.</strong></p>
  <h3>SHARPE J.A.:</h3>
  <p>[1] The respondent AE.L. is a disabled child who has special needs.  The
    respondent A.L. is AE.L.’s mother, AE.L.’s litigation guardian, co-plaintiff
    in the action, and respondent on this appeal.  The respondents sue on their
    own behalf and on behalf of a proposed class of similarly situated children
    and parents for damages against the appellant, Her Majesty the Queen in Right
    of Ontario (“Ontario”), represented by the Minister of Community and Social
    Services (the “Minister”).  The respondents base their claim on the <em>Child
    and Family Services Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.11 (“<em>CFSA</em>”).  Section
    30 of the <em>CFSA </em>provides that a parent or custodian who is unable
    to provide the services required by his or her special needs child “may make
    a written agreement” with the Minister whereby the Minister agrees to provide “services
    to meet the child’s special need”.  The respondents allege that since 1997,
    Ontario’s policy has been to refuse to enter any new s. 30 agreements.  They
    claim this has caused them and others similarly situated trauma, stress,
    and humiliation since without a s. 30 agreement the only way they could secure
    the necessary services was for the children to be surrendered to Children’s
    Aid Society (“CAS”) wardship through a temporary care agreement.  In the
    original statement of claim, the respondents’ claim was based on the allegation
    that Ontario was in breach of its statutory duty, giving rise to a claim
    in negligence. </p>
  <p>[2] The motions judge ruled that there was no legal basis for the negligence
    claim and dismissed the respondents’ motion to certify the action as a class
    proceeding.  He ruled that s. 30 conferred a discretion on the Minister and
    that the Minister could not be held liable in damages for refusing to exercise
    his discretion to enter such agreements.  The motions judge refused to certify
    the damages claim as a class proceeding but ruled, at para. 47, that the
    respondents were entitled to proceed with their claim for a declaration
    “that the Minister was in breach of statutory duties by failing to provide
    clear and consistent criteria for special needs agreements and in deciding
    to terminate their availability”.</p>
  <p>[3] The Divisional Court (reasons by Molloy J., O’Driscoll and Jarvis JJ.
    concurring) allowed the respondents’ appeal and certified the action as a
    class proceeding.  The Divisional Court ruled, at para. 9, that there was
    an arguable claim in negligence as the state was obliged to fund the services
    required by special needs children
    “under its <em>parens patriae</em> obligations at common law and the requirements
    of the CFSA”.  The Divisional Court found that it was arguable that the decision
    not to enter a s. 30 agreement was an operational decision that had to be
    made in a non-negligent manner.  The Divisional Court also found that there
    was an arguable claim for misfeasance in public office although that claim
    had not been pleaded.  </p>
  <p>[4] The appellant sought and obtained leave to appeal to this court. </p>
  <p>[5] For the following reasons, I would allow the appeal and set aside the
    order certifying this action as a class proceeding on the ground that the
    statement of claim does not plead facts capable of supporting the damages
    claims.</p>
  <h3>LEGISLATION</h3>
  <p>[6] The respondents’ claim is based upon s. 30 of the <em>CFSA</em>:</p>
  <p>30(1) A person who is unable to provide the services required by a child
    in his or her custody because the child has a special need, and a society
    having jurisdiction where the person resides, may with a Director’s written
    approval make a written agreement for,</p>
  <p>(a) the society’s provision of services to meet the child’s special need;
    and</p>
  <p>(b) the society’s supervision or care and custody of the child.</p>
  <p>(2) A person who is unable to provide the services required by achild in
    his or her custody because the child has a special need, and the Minister,
    may make a written agreement for,</p>
  <p>(a) the Minister’s provision of services to meet the child’s special need;
    and</p>
  <p>(b) the Minister’s supervision or care and custody of the child.</p>
  <p>(3) A special needs agreement shall only be made for a specific period,
    but may be extended, with a Director’s written approval in the case of an
    agreement with a society, for a further period or periods.</p>
  <p>[7] The term “special need” is defined in s. 26 of the <em>CFSA</em> as:</p>
  <p>[A] need that is related to or caused by a developmental disability or a
    behavioural, emotional, physical, mental or other disability.</p>
  <h3>FACTS</h3>
  <p>[8] This appeal arises from a motion to certify an action as a class proceeding
    pursuant to the <em>Class Proceedings Act, 1992</em>, S.O. 1992, c. 6 (“<em>CPA</em>”).  Section
    5(1)(a) of the <em>CPA</em> requires that the pleading disclose a cause of
    action.  Accordingly, my recitation of the facts will be restricted to those
    pleaded by the respondents in their statement of claim.</p>
  <p>[9] Following the Divisional Court’s judgment, the original statement of
    claim was amended.  The amended statement of claim now alleges misfeasance
    in public office as well as negligence.  The appellant submitted that this
    court should consider the original pleading that was before both the motions
    judge and the Divisional Court, but in oral argument suggested that in the
    interests of efficiency we should consider the amended statement of claim. </p>
  <p>[10] The key allegations in the amended statement of claim are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>AE.L. is a child with special needs arising out of his multiple disabilities.</li>
    <li>In January 2000, a local CAS advised AE.L.’s mother that the only way
      to obtain the funding for the services AE.L. required was to surrender
      custody to the CAS through a temporary care agreement.</li>
    <li>In September 2000, the local CAS advised AE.L.’s mother that she would
      have to agree to a full wardship order to secure services for AE.L. on
      a long-term basis.</li>
    <li>AE.L.’s mother learned about s. 30 of the <em>CSFA</em> and special needs
      agreements and, in January 2001, entered an agreement with the Ministry
      of Community and Social Services (the “Ministry”).</li>
    <li>Ontario breached its statutory duty by failing to establish or implement
      clear and consistent criteria and procedures for entering special needs
      agreements.</li>
    <li>The requirements of families with special needs children were not fairly
      assessed, and special needs agreements were entered on an ad hoc basis
      resulting in uneven and inequitable access to services.</li>
    <li>In the spring of 1997, the Ministry underwent a restructuring and, although
      s. 30 of the <em>CFSA</em> was never repealed, a Ministry directive effectively
      terminated the availability of special needs agreements.</li>
    <li>The decision to terminate special needs agreements “was irrational, reckless
      or made in bad faith.”</li>
    <li>Ontario knew or ought to have known that given the dependency of special
      needs children and the lack of available resources, termination of special
      needs agreements would cause “immediate and terrible pain, hardship and
      suffering.”</li>
    <li>Termination of special needs agreements “endangered the physical, emotional,
      mental and financial health of [the proposed] Class Members” in breach
      of Ontario’s
      “statutory and <em>parens patriae</em> obligations.”</li>
    <li>“Ontario owed a duty of care to provide Special Needs Agreements” to
      those eligible under s. 30 of the <em>CFSA</em> and beached that duty by, <em>inter
      alia</em>:
      <ul>
        <li>ceasing to issue and/or terminating special needs agreements without
          ensuring adequate alternative services were available to the respondents
          and other members of the proposed class;</li>
        <li>failing to provide and follow consistent criteria for special needs
          agreements;</li>
        <li>taking CAS custody of AE.L. and other members of the proposed class
          as a means of providing needed services.</li>
      </ul>
       </li>
    <li>Ontario, the Minister, and other Ministry officials are liable for the
      tort of misfeasance in public office for engaging in the following deliberate
      conduct that they knew or ought to have known was unlawful and likely to
      cause harm to the respondents and the proposed class members:
      <ul>
        <li>issued the directive not to enter into special needs agreements;
          and</li>
        <li>failed to exercise its discretion to enter into special needs agreements,</li>
      </ul>
       
      <p> despite reports by the Office of Child and Family Service Advocacy
        a the Ombudsman of Ontario that special needs children were being forced
        into the child protection system to secure their needs.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>CERTIFICATION MOTION</h3>
  <p>[11] The motions judge dismissed the certification motion on the ground
    that the statement of claim failed to disclose a cause of action in negligence.  The
    motions judge accepted Ontario’s submission that the allegations of negligence
    related to the allocation of public resources, a matter of policy that, in
    the absence of bad faith, is not reviewable by the courts and cannot form
    the basis for an action in negligence.  The essence of his analysis is found
    in paras. 42-43 of his reasons:</p>
  <p>[T]he court will not interfere with Ministerial decisions with respect to
    funding availability, priorities and allocations.  The plaintiff’s position
    is essentially that the powers conferred by the legislature on the Executive
    in s. 30 of the Act – for the benefit of a vulnerable segment of society – carry
    with them responsibilities that it is not entitled to walk away from without
    legislative approval.  However, even if this proposition were to be accepted,
    I do not think it would be sufficient to establish the existence of a duty
    of care for the purpose of actionable negligence.</p>
  <p>If such a duty existed, and was breached, the plaintiff would be entitled
    to damages as compensation for the harm suffered as a consequence.  In deciding
    the question of causation, the court would, of necessity, have to consider
    in each case whether assistance would or – should –
    have been provided and in what manner and to what extent.  That would require
    an inquiry into the manner in which Ministerial discretion with respect to
    funding priorities, and the allocation of funds, should be exercised.</p>
  <p>[12] The motions judge ruled, at para. 47, that the statement of claim raised
    an arguable claim for a declaration that the Minister was “in breach of statutory
    duties by failing to provide clear and consistent criteria for special needs
    agreements and in deciding to terminate their availability”.  However, he
    concluded that certification for that claim should be refused under s. 5(1)(d)
    of the <em>CPA</em> on the grounds that a class proceeding was not the preferable
    procedure as the claim could be more efficiently and effectively be presented
    by an individual.  The result of a successful declaratory action would inure
    to the benefit of the proposed class without the attendant cost and complexity
    of a class proceeding. </p>
  <h3>DIVISIONAL COURT</h3>
  <p>[13] The Divisional Court ruled that the motions judge erred by concluding
    at the pleadings stage that the decision to terminate s. 30 agreements was
    a policy decision.  According to the Divisional Court, that determination
    could be made only at trial.  The Divisional Court also disagreed with the
    motion judge’s conclusion that the respondents’ complaint was nothing more
    than the failure to allocate sufficient resources for special needs agreements
    under s. 30 of the <em>CFSA</em>.  The Divisional Court’s starting point,
    at para. 9, was that Ontario was required to provide for the special needs
    of children like AE.L. one way or the other  “under
    its <em>parens patriae</em> obligations at common law and the requirements
    of the CFSA”. On that assumption, the Divisional Court found that the decision
    to eliminate special needs agreements was arguably operational in nature.  The
    issue for the Divisional Court, at para. 7, was “not a matter of funding
    per se, but rather whether the funding is provided within the prescribed
    legislative mandate and in a manner that reflects the best interests of the
    child.”  The Divisional Court stated at para. 9:</p>
  <p>[T]he plaintiffs’ case is not really about the level of budget commitments
    or the allocation of scarce resources as a question of government policy
    and priority.  Rather, the plaintiffs argue this was an operational decision
    as to the manner in which services would be provided, with the government
    deciding to ignore the statutorily mandated route and with the result that
    children’s needs were not met at all or parents lost custody of their children
    so that the needs were met through the Children’s Aid Society.</p>
  <p>[14] The Divisional Court added, at para. 14, that the statement of claim
    also raised an arguable cause of action for misfeasance in public office,
    although the respondents did not plead this claim: “To
    establish the tort, the plaintiff must prove: (i) deliberate unlawful conduct
    in the exercise of public functions; and (ii) awareness that the conduct
    is unlawful and likely to injure the plaintiff.  These requisite elements
    are pleaded in the statement of claim.”</p>
  <p>[15] Having found that the statement of claim satisfied the requirements
    of s. 5(1)(a) of the <em>CPA </em>with respect to articulating an arguable
    cause of action in negligence and misfeasance in public office, the Divisional
    Court found that the action satisfied the other criteria for certification
    and ordered that it be certified. </p>
  <h3>ISSUES</h3>
  <p>[16] There are two issues in this appeal: </p>
  <p>(1) Does the amended statement of claim disclose a cause of action in negligence?</p>
  <p>(2) Does the amended statement of claim disclose a cause of action for misfeasance
    in public office?</p>
  <h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
  <p>[17] It is common ground that the test to be applied under s. 5(1)(a) of
    the <em>CPA</em> is the same as that applied under Rule 21 of the <em>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</em>: namely, assuming the allegations pleaded can be
    proved, is it “plain, obvious, and beyond doubt that the plaintiff could
    not succeed”.  Moreover, the claim “must be read generously with allowance
    for inadequacies due to drafting deficiencies”
    and should “not be dismissed simply because it is novel”: <em>Hunt v. Carey
    Canada Inc.</em>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959 at 980; <em>Hollick
    v. Toronto (City),</em> [2001] 3 S.C.R. 158 at
    para. 25.</p>
  <h3>(1) Does the amended statement of claim disclose a cause of action in negligence?</em></h3>
  <p>[18] It is also common ground that to determine whether a public authority
    owes a private law duty of care to an individual or to a class, the court
    is to apply the two-part test first announced by the House of Lords in <em>Anns
    v. Merton London Borough Council</em>,<em> </em>[1978] A.C. 728 at 751-52
    (H.L.), and refined by the Supreme Court of Canada in <em>Cooper v. Hobart</em>,
    [2001] 3 S.C.R. 537 at paras. 30-31:</p>
  <p>At the first stage of the <em>Anns </em>test, two questions arise: (1) was
    the harm that occurred the reasonably foreseeable consequence of the defendant’s
    act? and (2) are there reasons, notwithstanding the proximity between the
    parties established in the first part of this test, that tort liability should
    not be recognized here? The proximity analysis involved at the first stage
    of the <em>Anns </em>test focuses on factors arising from the <u>relationship</u> between
    the plaintiff and the defendant. These factors include questions of policy,
    in the broad sense of that word. If foreseeability and proximity are established
    at the first stage, a <em>prima facie</em> duty of care arises. At the second
    stage of the <em>Anns</em> test, the question still remains whether there
    are residual policy considerations outside the relationship of the parties
    that may negative the imposition of a duty of care….</p>
  <p>On the first branch of the <em>Anns</em> test, reasonable foreseeability
    of the harm must be supplemented by proximity. The question is what is meant
    by proximity. Two things may be said. The first is that “proximity” is generally
    used in the authorities to characterize the type of relationship in which
    a duty of care may arise. The second is that sufficiently proximate relationships
    are identified through the use of categories. The categories are not closed
    and new categories of negligence may be introduced. But generally, proximity
    is established by reference to these categories. This provides certainty
    to the law of negligence, while still permitting it to evolve to meet the
    needs of new circumstances.  [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p>I will refer to this test as the <em>Cooper/Anns </em>test.</p>
  <p>[19] In my view, the negligence claim advanced by the respondents is at
    odds with the nature of the legal relationship between the parties that is
    created by s. 30 of the <em>CSFA</em>.  Simply put, one does not commit a
    tort by refusing to enter into a contract.  The respondents’ negligence claim
    rests on the argument that s. 30 of the <em>CFSA</em> imposes a duty of care,
    yet s. 30 contemplates a voluntary agreement.  The central and fatal flaw
    in the respondents’ position is that they are attempting to impose a tort
    law duty of care that is inconsistent with the contractual relationship contemplated
    by s. 30.  Tort claims rest upon legally imposed duties; contractual obligations
    depend upon the mutual consent of the parties.  The statutory discretion
    conferred by s. 30 permits – but does not require – a voluntary agreement.  </p>
  <p>[20] The respondents conceded in oral argument that the Minister is under
    no legal obligation to enter a s. 30 special needs agreement and that the
    respondents have no legally enforceable right to insist that he do so, however
    compelling their need may be.  That is plain from the wording of s. 30 which
    speaks of an “agreement” that the Minister
    “may” authorize or enter.  This connotes a voluntary undertaking between
    two or more parties that becomes legally enforceable only by virtue of the
    parties’ mutual intent to create a legal obligation.  I fail to see how the
    law could superimpose an involuntary tort duty of care within a legal framework
    that itself requires voluntary consent to create a legal relationship.  Section
    30 gives the Minister the right to say “no”.  The Minister’s right to say
    “no” is a vital element in the creation of the legal obligation contemplated
    by s. 30 and is flatly inconsistent with a tort law duty that would require
    the Minister to say “yes” or make him liable for tort damages when he says “no”.</p>
  <p>[21] For a duty of care to be imposed, the harm must be foreseeable and
    a relationship of proximity must be found between the appellant and the respondents.  It
    is undoubtedly foreseeable that the respondents would suffer harm if the
    Minister refused to enter a special needs agreement.  However, this case
    does not fall within any established category in which proximity and a duty
    of care has been recognized.  Nor, in my view, can a duty of care be made
    out under the <em>Cooper/Anns</em> test as there is no proximity of relationship
    sufficient to give rise to a duty of care.  </p>
  <p>[22] According to <em>Cooper</em>, <em>supra </em>at para. 34, proximity
    is determined by “looking at expectations, representations, reliance, and
    the property or other interests involved” to
    “evaluate the closeness of the relationship between the plaintiff and the
    defendant” and by asking “whether it is just and fair having regard to that
    relationship to impose a duty of care in law upon the defendant.”  </p>
  <p>[23] In this case, the only possible source of a duty of care is the statute.  The <em>CFSA </em>confers
    upon the Minister certain powers to be exercised in the general public interest.  Section
    30 allows but does not require the Minister to enter special needs agreements.  Section
    30 is but one of many permissive sections that delineates various mechanisms
    to provide the services required to meet the needs of children.  For example,
    s. 7 (1) states that the Minister “may”:</p>
  <p>(a) provide services and establish, operate and maintain facilities for
    the provision of services; and</p>
  <p>(b) make arrangements with persons, municipalities and agencies for the
    provision of services,</p>
  <p>and may make payments for those services and facilities out of the legislative
    appropriations.</p>
  <p>[24] The determination of what services to fund and how to fund them is
    left to the Minister.  When deciding whether or not to enter a s. 30 agreement,
    the Minister is required to act in the public interest and balance competing
    demands for scarce public resources: see <em>Wynberg v. Ontario </em>(2006),
    269 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 435 at para. 257 (Ont. C.A.).  The statute presents
    the respondents with hope that the Minister might enter into a special needs
    agreement but, in the face of the Minister’s public duty to weigh other competing
    demands when deciding how to exercise his or her discretion, that hope does
    not amount to a legal duty of care that would ground an action for damages
    in negligence.  Decisions by the Minister “require the exercise of legislatively
    delegated discretion and involve pursuing a myriad of objectives consistent
    with public rather than private law duties”:  <em>Edwards</em> <em>v. Law
    Society of Upper Canada</em>, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 562 at para. 14.  The imposition
    of a duty of care would contradict and undercut the nature of the legal relationship
    contemplated by the statute and would be contrary to the public nature of
    any duty that is created by s. 30.</p>
  <p>[25] I wish to be clear that my decision does not rest on the assumption
    that the courts are entirely powerless to review or control the Minister’s
    exercise of the discretion conferred by s. 30.  I agree with the motions
    judge that it is not plain and obvious on the pleading that the respondents
    would necessarily fail on their claim that the Minister was in breach of
    certain statutory duties, namely, failing to provide clear and consistent
    criteria for special needs agreements and deciding to terminate their availability.  However,
    since any duties or obligations contemplated by the statute are public in
    nature, they are not capable of giving rise to a private tort law duty of
    care or an action in negligence for damages.</p>
  <p>[26] In my view, the Divisional Court erred in concluding otherwise.  The
    starting point for the Divisional Court appears to have been the assumption
    that Ontario was legally required to provide for AE.L.’s special needs.  According
    to the Divisional Court, the decision on the means that should be adopted
    to satisfy that obligation, whether through a s. 30 agreement or otherwise,
    was arguably operational in nature and would trigger a duty of care to implement
    the funding for services to meet AE.L.’s special needs in a non-negligent
    fashion. </p>
  <p>[27] I disagree with this analysis.  First, I do not agree that apart from
    s. 30, Ontario was legally required to pay for AE.L.’s special needs.  The
    Divisional Court referred to the <em>parens patriae</em> doctrine as the
    source for this obligation but cited no authority for that proposition.  Before
    us, counsel for the respondents conceded that the <em>parens patriae</em> doctrine
    does not impose an affirmative duty on the Crown to pay for AE.L.’s special
    needs.  Second, I disagree with the Divisional Court’s conclusion, at para.
    9, that “the plaintiffs’ case is not really about the level of budget commitments
    or the allocation of scarce resources as a question of government policy
    and priority.”  It seems to me apparent from the pleading itself that this
    is precisely what the respondents’ claim is all about.  The respondents’ claim
    directly targets policy decisions, especially the decision to terminate s.
    30 agreements.</p>
  <p>[28] Nor do I agree with the Divisional Court that a trial is required to
    decide whether the respondents’ claim rests on a policy or operational decision.  In
    my opinion, as in <em>Cooper</em> and <em>Edwards</em>, it is
    “plain and obvious” from the statute and from facts pleaded that the decision
    to refuse to enter s. 30 agreements falls within the definition of policy
    decisions, described by the Supreme Court of Canada in <em>Brown v. British
    Columbia (Minister of Transportation and Highways)</em>, [1994] 1 S.C.R.
    420 at 441:</p>
  <p>True policy decisions involve social, political and economic factors. In
    such decisions, the authority attempts to strike a balance between efficiency
    and thrift, in the context of planning and predetermining the boundaries
    of its undertakings and of their actual performance. True policy decisions
    will usually be dictated by financial, economic, social and political factors
    or constraints.  </p>
  <p>[29] The Minister’s determination of how to fund or not to fund the special
    needs of a child under s. 30 of the <em>CFSA</em> fits squarely within this
    category and gives rise to “difficult discretionary decisions in the area
    of public policy”: <em>Cooper</em>, <em>supra</em> at para. 53; <em>Edwards</em>, <em>supra </em>at
    para. 14; <em>Odhavji Estate v. Woodhouse</em>, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 263 at para.
    66.</p>
  <p>[30] It is equally clear that the decision to terminate s. 30 agreements
    does not amount to an operational decision: see <em>Brown</em>, <em>supra </em>at
    441: </p>
  <p>The operational area is concerned with the practical implementation of the
    formulated policies; it mainly covers the performance or carrying out of
    a policy. Operational decisions will usually be made on the basis of administrative
    direction, expert or professional opinion, technical standards or general
    standards of reasonableness.</p>
  <p>[31] This brings me to the second stage of the <em>Cooper/Anns </em>test.  Even
    if, on the facts pleaded, there was sufficient proximity to give rise to
    a <em>prima facie</em> duty of care under the first stage of the <em>Cooper/Anns</em> test,
    I would find under the second stage of the <em>Cooper/Anns </em>test that
    there are residual policy considerations outside the relationship of the
    parties that negative the imposition of a duty.  These residual policy concerns
    are explained in <em>Cooper</em>, <em>supra </em>at para. 37:</p>
  <p>These [residual policy concerns] are not concerned with the relationship
    between the parties, but with the effect of recognizing a duty of care on
    other legal obligations, the legal system and society more generally.  Does
    the law already provide a remedy?  Would recognition of the duty of care
    create the spectre of unlimited liability to an unlimited class?  Are there
    other reasons of broad policy that suggest that the duty of care should not
    be recognized?</p>
  <p>[32] Here, the law already provides a remedy that responds directly to the
    respondents’ complaint.  The allegation that the Minister acted improperly
    by terminating s. 30 agreements or by failing to provide adequate criteria
    or guidelines for their use can be addressed by way of declaratory action
    or an application for judicial review.  This is the proper remedy given the
    nature of the complaint: it relates to a statutory discretion and to duties
    owed to the public at large. </p>
  <p>[33] To recognize a private law duty of care would expose Ontario to claims
    for substantial damages by many families and individuals who believe that
    they have not received adequate services.  The respondents claim on behalf
    of the proposed class of some 30,000 individuals general damages of $500,000,000,
    special damages of $100,000,000, aggravated, exemplary and punitive damages
    of $50,000,000, and damages of $50,000,000 under the <em>Family Law Act</em>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3, s. 61.  In my view, to recognize a novel duty of care
    that would allow claims of this nature to proceed would be contrary to sound
    policy in this area of the law.  A private law duty of care would represent
    an unwarranted and undesirable intrusion that could interfere with the sound
    administration of the <em>CSFA</em>.  The Minister and the child welfare
    authorities have a difficult task to perform and limited resources at their
    disposal.  Their priorities should be based on the general public interest,
    not on the interests of particular individuals, however difficult and sympathetic
    their circumstances may be.  As in the case argued immediately before this
    one, <em>Eliopoulos v. Ontario (Minister of Health and Long-Term Care)</em>,
    [2006] O.J. No. 4400<em> </em>at para. 33 (C.A.), the “authorities should
    be left to decide where to focus their attention and resources without the
    fear or threat of lawsuits.”</p>
  <p><em>(2) Does the amended statement of claim disclose a cause of action for
      misfeasance in public office?</em></p>
  <p>[34] The original statement of claim did not plead the tort of misfeasance
    in public office.  The Divisional Court, on its own initiative, found that
    the respondents had pleaded the factual elements of the tort.  The respondents
    then amended the statement of claim to assert a claim for misfeasance in
    public office on the basis of the allegation that the appellant issued the
    directive not to enter s. 30 agreements and failed to exercise its discretion
    to enter s. 30 agreements when it knew or ought to have known that this was
    unlawful and likely to cause harm to the respondents and proposed class members.</p>
  <p>[35] The tort of misfeasance in public office is founded on the principle
    that those who hold public office and exercise public functions are subject
    to the law and must not abuse their powers to the detriment of ordinary citizens.  As
    Lord Steyn put it in <em>Three Rivers District Council v. Bank of England
    (No. 3)</em>,<em> </em>[2000] 2 W.L.R. 1220 at 1230:“The rationale of the
    tort is that in a legal system based on the rule of law executive or administrative
    power ‘may be exercised only for the public good’ and not for ulterior and
    improper purposes.” In <em>Odhavji Estate</em>, <em>supra</em> at
    para. 30, Iacobucci J. described the “underlying purpose” of the tort of
    misfeasance in public office as being “to protect each citizen’s reasonable
    expectation that a public officer will not intentionally injure a member
    of the public through deliberate and unlawful conduct in the exercise of
    public functions.”</p>
  <p>[36] In <em>Odhavji Estate</em>,<em> supra </em>at para. 23, Iacobucci J.
    described the elements of the tort: “First, the public officer must have
    engaged in deliberate and unlawful conduct in his or her capacity as a public
    officer.  Second, the public officer must have been aware both that his or
    her conduct was unlawful and that it was likely to harm the plaintiff.”  The
    ingredient of a deliberate unlawful act intended to inflict harm on the plaintiff
    is central to the tort: <em>Odhavji</em> <em>Estate </em>at para. 25.  Failure
    to discharge the functions of office because of budgetary constraints does
    not amount to a deliberate disregard of a public officer’s duties.  Rather,
    the tort is directed “at a public officer who <em>could</em> have discharged
    his or her public obligations, yet wilfully chose to do otherwise” [Emphasis
    in original.]: <em>Odhavji Estate </em>at para. 26.  Likewise, <em>Odhavji</em> <em>Estate </em>makes
    it clear, at para. 28, that public officials must retain the authority to
    make decisions adverse to the interests of particular individuals even with
    the knowledge that a course of action will cause harm: </p>
  <p>A public officer may in good faith make a decision that she or he knows
    to be adverse to interests of certain members of the public.  In order for
    the conduct to fall within the scope of the tort, the officer must deliberately
    engage in conduct that he or she knows to be inconsistent with the obligations
    of the office. </p>
  <p>[37] In my view, the amended statement of claim fails to plead facts sufficient
    to satisfy the requirements of the tort of misfeasance in public office.  The
    pleading makes bald allegations that recite the basic elements of the tort
    in very general terms but fails to provide material facts sufficient to demonstrate
    an intentional wrongdoing by a specific public officer aimed at the respondents.  The
    pleading does not allege that a specific public officer knowingly abused
    his or her statutory duties for the unlawful purpose of harming these respondents.  The
    pleading alleges only that Ontario adopted a general policy not to enter
    new s. 30 agreements that applied to all members of the public.  This lack
    of specificity is not merely a technical defect – it goes to the core of
    the respondents’ claim.  Stripped to its essentials, the misfeasance in public
    office claim consists of a general allegation that terminating s. 30 agreements
    was unlawful.  Although this allegation gives rise to a public law claim
    which may form the basis for an application for judicial review or an action
    for declaratory relief, it does not provide a foundation for a tort action
    for misfeasance in public office.  This case is readily distinguishable from <em>Roncarelli
    v. Duplessis</em>, [1959] S.C.R. 121.  Here, the respondents complain of
    a general policy decision not to fund special care needs by way of s. 30
    agreements that applied to all Ontario residents.  In <em>Roncarelli</em>,
    a provincial premier abused his statutory discretion to punish a specific
    individual for conduct unrelated to the statutory scheme. </p>
  <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
  <p>[38] For these reasons, I would allow the appeal and set aside the order
    certifying this action as a class proceeding on the ground that the statement
    of claim fails to disclose a cause of action as required by s. 5(1)(a) of
    the <em>CPA</em>.  The appellants do not seek costs and accordingly I would
    make no order in that regard. </p>
