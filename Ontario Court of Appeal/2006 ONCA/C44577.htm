style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>George
    Eliopoulos was bitten by a mosquito in Mississauga and became infected with
    West Nile Virus (“WNV”) in 2002.  He was treated in hospital and released
    but died in 2003 from complications following a fall.  His estate and family
    members (the “respondents”) sue Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Ontario
    (“Ontario”), as represented by the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care
    (the “Minister”), in negligence, alleging that Ontario could and should have
    prevented the outbreak of WNV in 2002.  This action, one of approximately
    forty similar actions brought by Ontario residents who contracted WNV in
    2002, has not progressed beyond the pleadings stage.  Ontario moved to strike
    the statement of claim on the ground that it discloses no cause of action.  The
    motions judge and the Divisional Court both rejected that contention.  Ontario
    appeals, with leave, to this court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    central issue is whether, on the facts that have been pleaded, Ontario owed
    Eliopoulos a private law duty of care to provide the necessary legal basis
    for a negligence action for damages.  The respondents submit that Ontario
    owed Eliopoulos a private law duty to take reasonable steps to prevent the
    spread of WNV, and that Ontario failed at the operational level to implement
    a plan it developed for the expected outbreak of WNV. Ontario submits that
    any duty it owed was to the public at large and that it owed no private law
    duty of care to specific individuals to prevent the spread of infectious
    diseases.  Ontario further submits that any liability for failure to implement
    measures to prevent WNV rests with local boards of health.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I conclude that it is plain and obvious on the facts
    that have been pleaded that Ontario does not owe a private law duty of care
    to individuals to prevent the spread of WNV and that the statement of claim
    should be struck. </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>

line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal arises from a motion to strike the statement of claim pursuant to
    rule 21.01(1)(b).  For the purposes of this appeal, the facts that are pleaded
    in the statement of claim must be taken as true.  The issue for this court
    is simply to decide whether the respondents could succeed in law if the facts
    they have pleaded are established at trial.  The central allegations in the
    amended statement of claim, identified as such in the respondents’ factum,
    are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Ontario
      is charged with the duty of promoting and protecting public health in the
    province;</span></li>
    <li><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Ontario
      has the duty, through the <i>Health Protection and Promotion Act, </i>R.S.O.
      1990, c. H.7 (“<i>HPPA</i>”), to prevent conditions which may put the health
      of Ontarians at risk and to provide early detection of health problems;</span></li>
    <li><span style='font-size:
13.0pt;font-family:Symbol'><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The
      primary vectors of WNV are mosquitoes, which feed mainly on birds from
      the corvid family of birds, including jays and crows.  As a result, a concentration
      of dead birds in a given area is often an important predictor of WNV;</span></li>
    <li><span style='font-size:
13.0pt;font-family:Symbol'><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Medical
      treatment for persons with WNV may include hospitalization, intravenous
      fluids, and respiratory support.  Persons with WNV may contract encephalitis,
      paralysis, meningitis, permanent neurological damage, or enter into a coma
      and die;</span></li>
    <li><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Since
      1999, WNV has spread throughout much of the United States and Canada.  It
      should have become apparent to Ontario in 1999 and, in any event, no later
      than 2000 that WNV was endemic and would eventually reach Ontario;</span></li>
    <li><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Surveillance
      information and/or local confirmatory testing for WNV in the dead bird
      population determined the level of risk of transmission of WNV to humans,
      which would, in turn, dictate the appropriate response from Ontario;</span></li>
    <li><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The
      recommendations of the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”)
      in Atlanta stressed the importance of local testing to make effective any
      plan for reducing the risk of transmission to humans;</span></li>
    <li><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Through</span> <span style='font-size:13.0pt;
'>the surveillance methods of the Laboratory Centre for Disease Control, a branch
      of Health Canada, WNV was identified in Canada in the corvid population
      as early as May 2000;</span></li>
    <li><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The
      Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (the “Ministry”) issued a
      document entitled <i>West Nile Virus: Surveillance and Prevention in Ontario,
      2001</i> (the “Plan”) on May 7, 2001 and decided to implement it;</span></li>
    <li><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The
      Plan focussed on detecting evidence of WNV in dead birds and in humans
      who presented with acute encephalitis or meningitis, both diseases being
      reportable in Ontario.  The Plan also emphasized public education as the
      key element for implementation and preventive actions;</span></li>
    <li><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The
      Plan was deficient in certain aspects, including the fact that it did not
      include provisions for adequate testing capacity;</span></li>
    <li><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Ontario’s
      efforts to prevent the spread of WNV into the human population were ineffective;</span></li>
    <li><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Since
      1999 it has been known that WNV was a threat in North America and that
      governments had a duty to develop and implement effective prevention plans
      to avoid a public health disaster;</span></li>
    <li><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Ontario’s
      failure to ensure timely and accurate testing meant that its Plan rested
      on an unstable foundation, which was made more acute when Ontario removed
      several key scientists from the WNV project;</span></li>
    <li><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Ontario
      could have proceeded with measures such as larviciding in the spring of
      2002 because of the presence of dead corvids in 2001;</span></li>
    <li><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Ontario’s
      Plan was not fully implemented in a reasonable and careful manner for reasons
      known only to Ontario and therefore, Ontarians were exposed to and contracted
      WNV;</span></li>
    <li><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Ontario
      breached its duty to ensure the implementation of the Plan in a non-negligent
      manner; and</span></li>
    <li><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Ontario’s
      negligence includes: </span>
      <ul>
        <li><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>its
          failure to take adequate steps to deal with WNV as an emergency in 2001
        and 2002;</span></li>
        <li><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>its
        failure to implement the entire Plan;</span></li>
        <li><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>its
        removal of key scientists from the project;</span></li>
        <li><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>its
          failure to take timely and effective measures to reduce the mosquito
        population in Ontario;</span></li>
        <li><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>its
          failure to coordinate efforts with the CDC, neighbouring provinces,
        and neighbouring states; and</span></li>
        <li><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>its

    there could be a duty of care arising from the alleged negligent implementation

    owed Eliopoulos a duty of care to act without negligence.  The motions judge

    the appeal:<i> Eliopoulos v. Ontario (Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care) </i>(2005),
    76 O.R. (3d) 36.  The Divisional Court agreed with the analysis of the motions
    judge and, at para. 17, added that it was unnecessary to determine whether
    a new duty of care should be recognized as the pleadings brought the case
    within a recognized category, namely, “circumstances that disclose reasonably
    foreseeable harm and proximity sufficient to establish a <i>prima facie</i> duty
    of care.” </p>

    is common ground that the test for striking a statement of claim at the pleadings
    stage is a stringent one with a difficult burden for defendants to meet.  The
    allegations of fact in the statement of claim, unless patently ridiculous
    or incapable of proof, must be accepted as proven.  In order to succeed,
    rule 21.01(1)(b) requires the moving party to show “that it is plain, obvious,
    and beyond doubt that the plaintiff could not succeed”.  Moreover, the claim “must
    be read generously with allowance for inadequacies due to drafting deficiencies” and
    should “not be dismissed simply because it is novel”: see <i>Hunt v. Carey
    Canada Inc.</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959 at 980.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is also common ground that to determine whether a public authority owes a
    private law duty of care to an individual or to a class, the court is to
    apply the two-part test first announced by the House of Lords in <i>Anns
    v. Merton London Borough Council</i>,<i> </i>[1978] A.C. 728 at 751-52 (H.L.),
    and refined by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Cooper v. Hobart</i>, [2001]
    3 S.C.R. 537 at paras. 30-31:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>At the first stage of the <i>Anns </i>test, two questions arise:&nbsp; (1)
    was the harm that occurred the reasonably foreseeable consequence of the
    defendant’s act? and (2) are there reasons, notwithstanding the proximity
    between the parties established in the first part of this test, that tort
    liability should not be recognized here?&nbsp; The proximity analysis involved
    at the first stage of the <i>Anns </i>test focuses on factors arising from
    the <u>relationship</u> between the plaintiff and the defendant.&nbsp; These
    factors include questions of policy, in the broad sense of that word.&nbsp; If
    foreseeability and proximity are established at the first stage, a <i>prima
    facie</i> duty of care arises.&nbsp; At the second stage of the <i>Anns</i> test,
    the question still remains whether there are residual policy considerations
    outside the relationship of the parties that may negative the imposition
    of a duty of care….</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>On the first
    branch of the <i>Anns</i> test, reasonable foreseeability of the harm must
    be supplemented by proximity.&nbsp; The question is what is meant by proximity.&nbsp; Two
    things may be said.&nbsp; The first is that “proximity” is generally used
    in the authorities to characterize the type of relationship in which a duty
    of care may arise.&nbsp; The second is that sufficiently proximate relationships
    are identified through the use of categories.&nbsp; The categories are not
    closed and new categories of negligence may be introduced.&nbsp; But generally,
    proximity is established by reference to these categories.&nbsp; This provides
    certainty to the law of negligence, while still permitting it to evolve to
    meet the needs of new circumstances.  [Emphasis in original.]</p>

    of harm by itself is not sufficient to establish a duty of care: “there must
    be reasonable foreseeability of the harm plus something more”, namely proximity,
    to establish a duty of care as described in <i>Cooper</i>, at paras. 29 and
    31.  Assuming for the purposes of this appeal that the spread of WNV was
    a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the acts alleged against Ontario,
    is it possible that there was a sufficient degree of proximity between Ontario

    representations, reliance, and the property or other interests involved” to
    “evaluate the closeness of the relationship between the plaintiff and the

    fit within or be analogous to a category having a degree of analytic precision
    comparable to the examples listed in <i>Cooper</i>, namely, an act that foreseeably
    causes physical harm to the plaintiff or the plaintiff’s property; nervous
    shock; a negligent misstatement; misfeasance in public office; breach of
    a recognized duty to warn; failure by a municipality to inspect housing developments
    without undue negligence; or failure to execute a policy of road maintenance
    in a non-negligent manner.  I agree with Ontario that the Divisional Court
    erred in finding that the facts pleaded bring this case within one of these
    established categories.  There is plainly no category of cases that supports
    the respondents’ assertion that Ontario owes a private law duty to protect
    all persons within its boundaries from contracting a disease and the respondents
    cannot succeed on the basis that their claim falls within or is analogous

    the source of the duty of care.  Accordingly, as in <i>Cooper</i>, in this

    my view, these important and extensive statutory provisions create discretionary
    powers that are not capable of creating a private law duty.  The discretionary
    powers created by the <i>HPPA</i> are to be exercised, if the Minister chooses
    to exercise them, in the general public interest.  They are not aimed at
    or geared to the protection of the private interests of specific individuals.  From
    the statement of purpose in s. 2 and by implication from the overall scheme
    of the <i>HPPA</i>, no doubt there is a general public law duty that requires
    the Minister to endeavour to promote, safeguard, and protect the health of
    Ontario residents and prevent the spread of infectious diseases.  However,
    a general public law duty of that nature does not give rise to a private
    law duty sufficient to ground an action in negligence.  I fail to see how
    it could be possible to convert any of the Minister’s public law discretionary
    powers, to be exercised in the general public interest, into private law
    duties owed to specific individuals.  Although <i>Mitchell (Litigation Administrator
    of) v. Ontario</i> (2004), 71 O.R. (3d) 571 (Div. Ct.), was concerned with
    a different statute, I agree with and adopt Swinton J.’s analysis at paras.

        framework gives the Minister the power to act in the public interest,
        and in exercising her powers, she must balance a myriad of competing
        interests.  The terms of the legislation make it clear that her duty

    of individuals who alleged that they had suffered loss as a result of the
    failure of a public authority to exercise its supervisory and investigatory
    powers.  <i>Cooper</i> involved a claim by investors who suffered losses
    at the hands of a mortgage broker.  The plaintiffs alleged that the British
    Columbia Registrar of Mortgage Brokers owed them a private law duty to suspend
    a mortgage broker’s licence or to notify investors if a mortgage broker was
    under investigation.  In <i>Edwards</i>, the plaintiffs suffered losses at
    the hands of a lawyer who allegedly used his trust account improperly.  The
    plaintiffs alleged that the Law Society of Upper Canada, which had knowledge
    of the manner in which the lawyer operated his trust account, owed them a
    private law duty to ensure that the lawyer’s trust account was operated according
    to the regulations or to warn the plaintiffs that it had abandoned its investigation.</p>

    both <i>Cooper</i> and <i>Edwards</i>, the statements of claim were struck
    because the public authority owed no private law duty of care to the plaintiffs.  In
    both cases, after reviewing the statutory powers and duties of the defendant,
    the Supreme Court concluded that any duty was owed to the public as a whole
    rather than to individual investors or clients who interacted with the brokers
    or lawyers regulated by the legislation.  In <i>Cooper</i>, the Supreme Court
    concluded, at para. 49: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Even though
    to some degree the provisions of the Act serve to protect the interests of

  <p align=left style='text-align:left'>Similarly in <i>Edwards</i>, the Supreme

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The <i>Law Society

      trust account.&nbsp; Decisions made by the Law Society require the exercise

    classes of individuals whose specific interests were vulnerable to the very
    agents the public authorities were mandated to supervise, yet no duty of
    care was found.  This case is concerned with a general risk faced by all
    members of the public and a public authority mandated to promote and protect
    the health of everyone located in its jurisdiction.  The risk of contracting
    a disease that might have been prevented by public health authorities is
    a risk that is faced by the public at large.  It is a much more generalized
    risk than the type faced by mortgage investors or clients of lawyers.  Moreover,
    the nexus or relationship between a member of the public who contracts WNV
    and the Minister is more attenuated than the nexus or relationship between
    a mortgage investor and the regulator of mortgage brokers or a client and
    the regulator of the legal profession.  It was held to be plain and obvious

    2 S.C.R. 1228; <i>Brown v. British Columbia (Minister of Transportation and

    J. notes:</p>

    difficult to read the Plan as a policy decision of the kind that would engage
    Ontario at the operational level.  Second, to the extent that the Plan amounted
    to a policy decision to act and created a duty of care, it is clear from
    the terms of the Plan itself and from relevant legislation to which I will
    refer that any operational duties created by the Plan resided with local
    authorities and local boards of health.  Third, although the respondents
    frame their arguments in terms of the alleged failure to execute operational
    duties in a non-negligent manner, their statement of claim essentially rests
    on the ground that Ontario failed to adopt adequate policies to prevent WNV,
    not on its failure to implement the Plan in a non-negligent manner.</p>

    turn to the issue of whether the Plan amounted to the adoption of a policy
    that engaged Ontario at the operational level.  The Plan was prepared by
    the Public Health Branch of the Ministry in cooperation with a number of
    non-governmental agencies.  Its purpose, as described at p. 5 of the Plan,
    was “to describe the Surveillance Plan for WNV in the Province of Ontario” and “the
    Prevention and Public Education measures aimed at reducing the risk of WNV
    disease for the population of Ontario”.  The Plan’s focus, as described on
    pp. 5-6, was on “surveillance systems to identify WNV in dead birds, mammals
    and mosquitoes”, on “passive surveillance systems for human cases” and on
    public education to encourage certain preventative measures, namely “(1) ‘source
    reduction’” (reducing or eliminating mosquito breeding sites), and (2)
    ‘personal protective measures’ against mosquitoes.  The key strategy for
    implementing these preventative actions is through public education.”  As
    I read it, the Plan represented an attempt by the Ministry to encourage and
    coordinate appropriate measures to reduce the risk of WNV by providing information
    to local authorities and the public.  The Ministry undertook to do very little,
    if anything at all, beyond providing information and encouraging coordination.  The
    implementation of specific measures was essentially left to the discretion
    of members of the public, local authorities, and local boards of health. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Plan explained the epidemiology of WNV and the level of risk of a WNV outbreak
    in Ontario in 2001.  Dead bird surveillance was described, at p. 10, as “a
    vital part of WNV surveillance activities”.  The public was asked to contact
    local boards of health to report findings of dead corvids and local boards
    of health were instructed to follow a protocol in order to determine whether
    to submit the carcass to the Canadian Cooperative Wildlife Health Centre
    in Guelph for testing, at pp. 11-12.  The only specific action identified
    for the Ministry in the Plan was to supply information, as specified on p.
    12, in the form of a “direct mailing” to specialty physicians and emergency
    departments in Ontario regarding diagnosis of WNV in humans.  It was left
    to local health departments, at p. 12, to “contact approximately sixty hospitals
    in southern Ontario to provide advice, protocols as required, and establish
    prompt diagnostic efforts and reporting of suspected cases to the local medical
    officer of health” as required. Testing of mosquito pools in the event that
    a bird, mammal, or human was confirmed to be infected with WNV was left to
    local authorities.  Local health units were asked to consider “enhanced surveillance” in
    areas of confirmed WNV activity and could notify local physicians accordingly,
    at p. 14.  Reporting, collecting, and testing was left to local authorities
    and the public.  Public education measures to reduce or eliminate mosquito-breeding
    sites were recommended, not mandated, and it was essentially left to the
    local authorities and members of the public at large to decide what measures
    were appropriate.  Similar recommendations were made regarding personal protective
    measures.  No direction was given as to the “use of chemical, as well as
    non-chemical, means of mosquito abatement/control”, besides noting that this
    matter was under review by the National Steering Committee for West Nile
    Virus, chaired by Health Canada from which a final response was “expected
    very shortly from Health Canada.” </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    summarize, the Plan provided information about WNV and encouraged members
    of the public and local authorities, in cooperation with various governmental
    and non-governmental agencies, to undertake surveillance and preventative
    measures.  The Ministry did not undertake to collect infected birds, conduct
    inspections, or take measures to reduce or eliminate the mosquito population,
    nor did it mandate such measures.  The Ministry merely provided others with
    information and recommendations.  In my view, the Plan falls well short of
    the sort of policy decision to do something about a particular risk that
    triggers a private law duty of care to implement such policy at the operational
    level in a non-negligent manner.  </p>

    turn to the second point and whether, to the extent the Plan may be read
    as creating operational duties, those duties reside with Ontario.  As I have
    already stated, the Plan does not identify operations that are to be performed
    by the Ministry beyond providing general information and coordination.  To
    the extent the Plan may be read as identifying specific operations to be
    performed, those tasks are left to local authorities and local boards of
    health.  In this regard, the Plan mirrors the scheme of the <i>HPPA</i>,
    ss. 4 and 5: responsibility for the implementation of health policy, including
    superintending and carrying out health promotion, health protection, disease
    prevention, community health protection, and control of infectious diseases
    and reportable diseases, rests with local boards of health, not the Ministry.  Local
    boards of health are subject to direction from the Minister (s. 83(1)), and
    in the event the local board of health fails to follow such direction, the
    Minister can act in its stead (s. 84(1)).  However, this serves only to emphasize
    that under the <i>HPPA</i>, local boards of health, constituted as independent
    non-share capital corporations, bear primary operational responsibility for
    the implementation of health promotion and disease prevention policies. </p>

    while the respondents argue that the Ministry’s policy decisions reflected
    in the Plan engage an operational duty, fairly read, the core allegations
    relate to what could only be regarded as policy decisions.  In <i>Brown</i>, at
    p. 441, the Supreme Court of Canada described the distinction between policy
    and operational decisions as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>True policy
    decisions involve social, political and economic factors.  In such decisions,
    the authority attempts to strike a balance between efficiency and thrift,
    in the context of planning and predetermining the boundaries of its undertakings
    and of their actual performance.  True policy decisions will usually be dictated
    by financial, economic, social and political factors or constraints.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The operational
    area is concerned with the practical implementation of the formulated policies;
    it mainly covers the performance or carrying out of a policy.  Operational
    decisions will usually be made on the basis of administrative direction,

    allegations of negligence in the respondents’ statement of claim essentially
    rest on a number of broad-ranging allegations that Ontario failed to adopt
    adequate policies and failed to devote adequate resources to prevent the
    spread of WNV.  It is alleged in the statement of claim, for example, that
    Ontario failed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>“to
    take steps to deal with WNV as an emergency in Ontario in 2001 and 2002”;</li>
    <li><span
style='font-family:Symbol'><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>“to
    give the safety and health of Ontario’s citizens the highest priority”;</li>
    <li> “to
      take reasonable, timely and effective measures to reduce the mosquito population
    in Ontario”;</li>
    <li> “to
      take reasonable, timely and effective measures to warn the citizens of
    Ontario about the potentially fatal threat of WNV”; and</li>
    <li> “to
      develop a test for WNV in a timely an effective manner”.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, these allegations relate to issues of public health policy, the
    establishment of governmental priorities, and the allocation of scarce health
    care resources, not the implementation of a specific health promotion or
    prevention policy at the operational level.  I see no similarity between
    allegations of this nature and the alleged failure to inspect and maintain
    public highways at issue in <i>Just</i> and <i>Brown</i>.  Developing an
    appropriate policy to control mosquitoes and the spread of an infectious
    disease across all of southern Ontario bears little similarity to implementing
    a specific policy for the maintenance and repair of public highways.  The
    Plan does not, therefore, amount to an operational plan, with commensurate
    duties, on which the respondents could base a claim in negligence.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    I am wrong that it is plain and obvious that on the facts pleaded there is
    no proximity sufficient to give rise to a <i>prima facie</i> duty of care
    under the first stage of the <i>Cooper/Anns</i> test, I would find under
    the second stage of the <i>Cooper/Anns </i>test that there are residual policy
    considerations outside the relationship of the parties that negative the
    imposition of a duty.  These residual policy concerns are explained in <i>Cooper</i>,
    at para. 37:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>These [residual policy concerns] are not concerned with the relationship between
    the parties, but with the effect of recognizing a duty of care on other legal
    obligations, the legal system and society more generally.  Does the law already
    provide a remedy?  Would recognition of the duty of care create the spectre
    of unlimited liability to an unlimited class?  Are there other reasons of
    broad policy that suggest that the duty of care should not be recognized?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    risk of contracting disease spread by mosquitoes is one to which all who
    live in Ontario are exposed.  It is not a risk that is created by the provincial
    government or that arises from the use of a public facility, such as a highway,
    provided by Ontario.  In deciding how to protect its citizens from risks
    of this kind that do not arise from Ontario’s actions and that pose an undifferentiated
    threat to the entire public, Ontario must weigh and balance the many competing
    claims for the scarce resources available to promote and protect the health
    of its citizens. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with Ontario’s submission that to impose a private law duty of care
    on the facts that have been pleaded here would create an unreasonable and
    undesirable burden on Ontario that would interfere with sound decision-making
    in the realm of public health.  Public health priorities should be based
    on the general public interest. Public health authorities should be left
    to decide where to focus their attention and resources without the fear or
    threat of lawsuits.</p>
