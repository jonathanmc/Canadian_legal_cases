      of Justice Michael H. Tulloch of the Superior Court of Justice, dated November

  <h2>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is an appeal from the decision of Tulloch J. affirming the assessment of
    the Minister of Finance, who assessed retail sales tax against the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant would be exempt from retail sales tax under the <i>Retail Sales
    Tax Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.  R. 31, s. 7(1) 61 if its boats, which are less
    than 1400 cubic metres, were operating for “commercial purposes.”  The definition
    of “commercial purposes” in R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 1012 includes “the use of a
    vessel for regularly scheduled public transportation services for profit
    or with a view to profit”.  The definition specifically excludes from the
    exemption “the operation of boats for tourists” and “the operation of boats
    for charter or tour services that may or may not make scheduled stops incidental
    to the service”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge defined the issue as “whether the use of the vessels is exclusively
    for the legislative purpose”; that is, for public transportation because,
    in his view, “the Act intends to exempt transportation services but not tourist
    services.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    concluding that the appellant was providing “a tourist opportunity” rather
    than a transportation service, the trial judge acknowledged that the boats
    transported the public on a regular, published schedule. Further, the trial
    judge recognized that the appellant would not be disentitled to the exemption
    simply because some passengers on board were also tourists.  However, although
    the boats occasionally transported passengers from Tobermory to Flower Pot
    Island for scientific purposes or for purposes related to the lighthouse,
    he concluded that the boats operated primarily for the purpose of providing
    scenic tours.  That conclusion was based on the trial judge’s factual findings,
    including that the principal boat was equipped with a glass bottom to permit
    passengers to view the 19<sup>th</sup> century shipwrecks en route to the
    uninhabited Flower Pot Island, which is a National Park. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly,
    to view the shipwrecks, that boat routinely took a scenic route through a
    restricted area, a route that was longer than would be necessary for the
    purposes of transportation. The trial judge also considered the appellant’s
    own brochures promoting the boats for the purpose of a “Flower Pot Island
    Cruise.”  Those brochures described the service as a glass bottom boat tour
    of shipwrecks, Cove Island Harbour and the lighthouse. They also advertised
    the option of a shorter tour that did not involve disembarkation. Finally,
    the trial judge noted that the boats’ owner is engaged generally in the tourist
    business in the area.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, the trial judge made a clear factual finding that the primary
    purpose of the boats was for tourist rather than transportation purposes.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    see no basis to interfere with the trial judge’s findings or the conclusion
    that follows that, even if the boats were used “exclusively”
    for regularly scheduled public transportation purposes, in pith and substance
    their purpose was for the “operation of boats for tourists.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, the appellant argues that the trial judge erred in failing to address
    its position that the expenses incurred in refitting the boats were not operating
    but capital costs and, for that reason, were exempt from retail sales tax.  This
    argument is based on the wording of the act that excludes from the retail
    sales tax exemption “the operation” of boats.  However, s. 2(1) of the Act
    levies the tax on “tangible personal property” purchased for use or consumption.  It
    is irrelevant that the purchase of the property is for capital purposes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is dismissed. As the issue raised is a novel one, there will be
    no order for costs.</p>
