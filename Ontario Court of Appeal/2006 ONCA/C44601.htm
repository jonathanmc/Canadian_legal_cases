  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment
      of Justice Michael R. Dambrot of the Superior Court of Justice dated November
      16, 2005, reported at (2005), 18 C.P.C. (6<sup>th</sup>) 324. </span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BY THE COURT:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      This appeal raises the issue of whether the Attorney General
      of Ontario (“AG”) is required, as a matter of constitutional law, to establish
      an independent commission to address remuneration for the Deputy Judges
      of the Ontario Small Claims Court, a branch of the Superior Court of Justice.
      Currently, Deputy Judges’ remuneration is established by regulation made
      by the Lieutenant Governor in Council, often referred to as an Order-in-Council.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      The application judge held that the Deputy Judges’ salaries
      have eroded to the extent that they now fall below the basic minimum acceptable
      remuneration required for their office.  He further held that the principle
      of judicial independence, particularly its financial security component,
      requires the government to establish an independent commission to make
      recommendations on the Deputy Judges’ remuneration. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>       The AG concedes that Deputy Judges are entitled to judicial
      independence. The AG appeals on the basis that the current Order-in-Council
      process complies with the financial security requirement in a manner appropriate
      to the Deputy Judges’ office. Accordingly, the AG argues, as a matter of
      constitutional law, an independent commission is not required. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>     With
      respect, we do not accept that the current Order-in-Council process passes
      constitutional muster. Like the application judge, we believe that an independent
      body is required to address the remuneration of Deputy Judges. The nature
      of that body, however, is a different matter. In that regard, there is
      room for flexibility. No single model is mandated; what is required is
      a process that is independent, effective and objective.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>     The Small Claims Court, a branch of the Superior Court of Justice,
      has jurisdiction over civil claims up to $10,000, although that jurisdiction
      increases to $20,000 where the case involves both a $10,000 claim and a
      $10,000 counterclaim.    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>     The judicial complement of the Small Claims Court is comprised
      of two full-time judges and four supernumerary judges of the former Provincial
      Court (Civil Division) as well as approximately 390 Deputy Judges. The
      full-time and supernumerary judges are appointed until retirement and may
      only be removed from office by order of the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario
      on the address of the Legislative Assembly.  As with all judges of the
      Provincial Court, the remuneration of the judges of the former Provincial
      Court (Civil Division) is established by regulation following delivery
      of a report from the Provincial Judges’ Remuneration Commission. Currently,
      supernumerary judges of the former Provincial Court (Civil Division) receive
      a <i>per diem</i> of $995.39 for a full sitting day in Small Claims Court. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      Deputy Judges, who are practising or retired lawyers, are appointed
      to the Small Claims Courts by a Regional Senior Judge (“RSJ”) of the Superior
      Court pursuant to s. 32 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
      c. C.&nbsp;43. Their initial appointments are made with the approval of
      the Attorney General for a three-year term. Subsequent renewals are made
      by the RSJ for one or more three-year terms. Deputy Judges may be removed
      from office by the RSJ where the RSJ determines that the Deputy Judge’s
      conduct warrants that sanction.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>     Fewer than a dozen of the Deputy Judges decide a significant
      percentage of Toronto cases; the court, and not the government, determines
      the resulting significant sitting schedules for those few judges. On average,
      however, Deputy Judges sit one day per month. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>     Pursuant to s. 53(1)(b.1) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>,
      the remuneration of Deputy Judges is set by regulation made by the Lieutenant
      Governor in Council. In the 11-year period between 1971 and 1982, the <i>per
      diem</i> compensation of Deputy Judges was increased on seven occasions,
      increasing from $50 per day to the current level of $232 per day. That
      rate has remained unchanged for the past 24 years, despite its erosion
      by inflation. At the same time, the Small Claims Court has experienced
      significant increases in both workload and jurisdiction. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Application Judge’s Decision</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      application judge concluded that an independent remuneration commission
      for Deputy Judges is required for two reasons. First, relying on <i>Reference
      re Remuneration of Judges of the Provincial Court of Prince Edward Island</i>,
      [1997] 3 S.C.R. 3 (“<i>PEI Reference</i>”), he held at para. 51 that the
      current rate of remuneration falls below a minimum acceptable standard:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he remuneration of Deputy Judges is so obviously
    inadequate and so disgracefully eroded that no great leap in logic is required
    to conclude, as I do, there is a danger, however speculative, that members
    of the judiciary could be tempted to adjudicate cases in a particular way
    in order to secure a higher salary from the executive or the legislature
    or to receive benefits from one of the litigants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
      he held at para. 55 that an independent commission is the mechanism required
      to protect the financial security of all judges, including Deputy Judges:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>While it cannot be doubted that the principle of
    judicial independence must be applied flexibly to different types of decision-makers,
    I see no warrant in the pronouncements of the Supreme Court for the idea
    that recourse to an independent commission to consider judicial remuneration
    is an exceptional, Cadillac protection applicable only to “important” judges.
    When the Supreme Court says that it is an essential component of judicial
    independence that any changes to or freezes in judicial remuneration require
    prior recourse to a special process, which is independent, effective and
    objective, I take it at its word.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While
      the application judge acknowledged that there can be flexibility in establishing
      the precise contours of the process for determining judicial remuneration,
      he did not accept that determining Deputy Judges’ judicial remuneration
      by way of Order-in-Council, without more, could be viewed as an independent,
      effective and objective process (at para. 56):</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>But I fail to see how determining Deputy Judges’ remuneration
    by way of Order-in-Council, without more, can conceivably be viewed as an
    independent, effective and objective process for determining judicial remuneration.
    It is obviously neither independent nor objective, and it is hard to imagine
    how it could conceivably be characterized as effective. In this case, it
    is no process at all. And given the absence of any increase in the remuneration
    of Deputy Judges since 1982, if it is a process, it is a moribund one.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Attorney General’s Submissions </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><strong><span
lang=EN-US style='color:black;font-weight:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></strong><span lang=EN-US>Although
      the AG concedes that the principle of judicial independence applies to
      the office of Deputy Judges, he </span><strong><span lang=EN-US style='color:black;
font-weight:normal'>argues that the requirements for ensuring judicial independence
      are flexible. According to the AG, the highest level of protection does
      not apply to every type of judge; there is a sliding scale or spectrum
      of protection and the Deputy Judges fall at the low end of this scale.</span></strong></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><strong><span
lang=EN-US style='color:black;font-weight:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></strong><strong><span lang=EN-US style='color:black;font-weight:normal'>To
        support this argument, the AG points to the limited jurisdiction of the
        Small Claims Court and its lack of criminal jurisdiction, including jurisdiction
        to hear cases engaging s. 11(d) of the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  The
        AG also contends that there is no basis for extending a high level of
        financial security, such as that provided by  a remuneration commission,
        to Deputy Judges who do not enjoy a high level of security of tenure.
        Further, argues the AG, there is no basis for requiring a high level
        of financial security for the purpose of protecting judicial independence.
        On this issue, the AG asserts that the part-time nature of the Deputy
        Judges’ work attenuates or eliminates the risk of economic manipulation
        of individual judges. For these reasons, the AG submits that the Order-in-Council
        process satisfies the financial security component of the principle of
        judicial independence and that the application judge erred in reaching
        a contrary conclusion. </span></strong></p>

        we have indicated, the AG concedes the application of the principle of
        judicial independence to these judges. As set out in the <i>PEI Reference</i>,
        judicial independence embodies the three core characteristics of financial
        security, security of tenure and administrative independence, as well
        as the two dimensions of individual and institutional independence:  see <i>PEI
        Reference</i> at paras. 115 and 118; <i>R. v. Valente</i>, [1985] 2.

        security is at issue in this case. As the Supreme Court said about financial
        security in <i>Valente</i> at para. 40:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><strong><span
style='color:black;font-weight:normal'>The essence of [financial] security is
        that the right to salary and pension should be established by law and
        not be subject to arbitrary interference by the Executive in a manner
        that could affect judicial independence.</span></strong></p>

        the individual and the institutional dimensions of judicial independence
        apply to financial security. The Supreme Court explained the nature of
        the two dimensions. Regarding the individual dimension, it was stated
        in <i>Valente</i> and reiterated in the <i>PEI Reference</i>, that judicial
        salaries must be established so that they do not “affect the independence
        of the individual judge”:  <i>Valente</i> at para. 43; <i>PEI Reference</i> at
        para. 121. Individual independence refers to the liberty of the individual
        judge to decide discrete cases free from external interference or influence: <i>Beauregard
        v. Canada</i>, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 56 at para. 21.  A concern arises about
        individual independence </span></strong><strong><span lang=EN-US

normal'>In this case, individual independence is not the primary issue, given
        that most Deputy Judges sit on a part-time basis. Their judicial remuneration

        The only requirement is that the proposed entity be independent, effective
        and objective. The body chosen would produce a report to the government.
        Its recommendations, while non-binding, would not be set aside lightly,

        the AG put forward the option of appointing an independent single remuneration
        consultant to make recommendations on the appropriate remuneration. Counsel
        for the Deputy Judges Association appeared receptive to this proposal.
        Another possible option would link judicial remuneration for Deputy Judges
        with the remuneration provided for an objectively-chosen comparator group.
        Moreover, we were advised that a law dean has been appointed to produce
        a report, which is to be released next month, that will include a consideration
