  <p><b>On appeal from the order of Justice </b><b>Randall S. Echlin of the Superior Court of
    Justice dated May 27, 2004.</b></p>
  <h2><span style='font-size:16.0pt;'>ENDORSEMENT</span></h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>  Following a jury trial, Echlin J. granted judgment to the
    respondent for $35,126 representing the balance owing on account of prepaid
    telephone cards sold to the appellant plus pre-judgment interest and costs.
    Although the judgment does not refer to the appellant's counterclaim, it is
    implicit that, in accordance with the verdict of the jury, the counterclaim was
    dismissed. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The appellant raised several issues on
    appeal. We called on the respondent only in relation to the issues raised
    concerning damages for slander. Dealing briefly with the other issues raised,
    in our view, the appellant has not met the threshold for establishing
    reasonable apprehension of bias. Further, viewed in context, we are not
    satisfied that the trial judge's erroneous comment to the jury concerning when
    the appellant acknowledged funds were owing to the respondent undermined the
    appellant’s position with the jury.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Even if it was not technically open to
    the trial judge to grant a motion for partial judgment prior to the conclusion
    of the trial, we see no prejudice arising from the procedure adopted by the
    trial judge. The appellant acknowledges that, subject to his counterclaim, the
    sum of $35,126 is owing to the respondent. The jury found that the respondent
    did not defraud the appellant and the appellant has not raised any issue on
    appeal concerning his counterclaim for inducing breach of contract. For reasons
    that we will explain, we propose to order a new trial in relation to the
    appellant's counterclaim for slander. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>When the jury reached its verdict they
    sent a note to the trial judge stating:</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-GB>We have come to a verdict and it will not be affected by the answer
    to our question. Can we add a recommendation to our verdict?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-GB>After consulting with the parties, the trial judge declined to
    receive the jury’s recommendation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In our view, while it would have been
    open to the trial judge to obtain and review the jury’s recommendation, because
    the jury stated specifically that the recommendation did not affect the
    verdict, the trial judge did not err by declining to do so.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Turning to the grounds of appeal
    relating to damages for slander, we note at the outset that the appellant was
    unrepresented in the court below and that, in his counterclaim, he pleaded
    slander only and provided no particulars. At trial, evidence was led without
    objection of both libel and slander. Although the trial judge explained the
    difference between libel and slander in his charge, he did not tell the jury
    what evidence was capable of constituting either libel or slander. Moreover, as
    we will explain, the trial judge’s instructions on damages were incomplete and
    the only questions put to the jury on the issue of defamation related to
    slander. In their verdict, the jury found that the appellant was slandered
    either by the respondent or its principal, but assessed damages at zero. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In our view, when dealing with the
    counterclaim for slander, it was incumbent on the trial judge to explain the
    concepts of general, special and nominal damages to the jury, and to also
    instruct the jury that, in an action for slander concerning the appellant's
    business trade or calling</span><a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt;'>[1]</span></span></a><span
lang=EN-GB>, proof of special damages is not essential. Further, in respect of
    general damages, the trial judge should have instructed the jury that such
    damages are at large and presumed. In this case, the plaintiff's claim was for
    the balance owing on a contract. In order to dispose of that claim, it was
    unnecessary that the jury understand the concept of damages. Particularly in
    these circumstances, we are unable to conclude that the jury's verdict in
    relation to damages on the counterclaim would necessarily have been the same
    had they been properly instructed.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>For these reasons, the appeal is
    allowed in part and the judgment is amended to dismiss the counterclaim. As Mr.
    Kang was not made a party to this appeal, that portion of the judgment
    dismissing the counterclaim for slander is set aside against Elim Tech Inc.
    only. Further, given that the counterclaim proceeded on the basis of both libel
    and slander, that the trial judge charged the jury in relation to both causes
    of action without objection, and at the request of the appellant, it is ordered
    that there be a new trial in relation to the appellant’s counterclaim for
    defamation. The appellant shall deliver an amended counterclaim, which may
    include claims for both libel and slander and which shall provide particulars
    of the appellant’s claim(s). The respondent may deliver an amended defence to
    counterclaim raising any applicable defences.</span></p>

    there shall be no order as to costs.</span></p>
