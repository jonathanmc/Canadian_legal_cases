style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant walked into a bank, gave a note to the teller demanding money,
    obtained $5,000.00 and left. The trial judge concluded that this was a robbery
    because the Crown had proven threats of violence. The appellant argues that
    he should only have been convicted of theft. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view the trial judge’s factual findings are dispositive of this issue.
    The appellant walked into the bank fully disguised. His head was completely
    wrapped in gauze bandages leaving only his eyes exposed. In addition he wore
    a baseball cap. He handed the teller a note demanding money. He deliberately
    refused to use his voice and responded to the teller’s questions only by
    nodding or shaking his head. In addition, the trial judge accepted the teller’s
    evidence that she “was very, very nervous and my fear was I just wanted to
    make sure that I did everything correctly so nobody would get hurt”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    threat of violence was implicit in the location of the crime and in the appellant’s
    conduct, including his disguise. The trial judge’s findings, which were amply
    supported by the evidence, support the appellant’s conviction for robbery. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also appeals his sentence of 15 months imposed following his conviction
    for robbery and disguise with intent. The appellant argues that the sentence
    imposed is overlong and ought to have been a conditional sentence to be served
    in the community. In his reasons for sentence the trial judge did not adequately
    address why a conditional sentence for this offender would not appropriately
    meet the requirements for denunciation and general deterrence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    robbery is always a serious offence, there are degrees of seriousness as
    is apparent from the broad range of sentences imposed by courts for this
    offence. The appellant had no criminal record at the time of this offence.
    The Pre-Sentence Report was most favourable and, indeed, said that the appellant
    was a suitable candidate for service in the community. Mr. Pilgrim, another
    individual who was also involved in this robbery with the appellant, received
    only a five-month sentence to be served conditionally. Mr. Pilgrim had a
    serious record, particularly when compared with that of the appellant, and
    was the subject of an especially negative Pre-Sentence Report. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the trial judge’s failure to consider a conditional sentence on
    the facts of this case was an error in principle: see <i>R. v. Proulx</i>,
    [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61. In the particular circumstances of this case, we are
    of the view that the appellant should have been granted a conditional sentence.
    We would not, however, interfere with the duration of the sentence as it
    is in the appropriate range albeit at the lower end for this offence and
    we note that the appellant has already served some two and one-half months
    in custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, the appeal against conviction is dismissed. Leave to appeal sentence
    is granted and the appeal is allowed to the extent that the appellant may
    serve his sentence conditionally.</p>
