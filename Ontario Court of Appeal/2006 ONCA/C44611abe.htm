lang=EN-US>Justice Thea P. Herman of the
    Superior Court of Justice dated November 29,&nbsp;2005</span><span lang=EN-US>.</span></h4>
  <h2>APPEAL&nbsp;BOOK ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During a motion for summary judgment, the appellants sought to
    amend their statement of claim to raise a new cause of action.  The motion judge denied leave in respect of
    the amendments in question on the basis that the proposed amendments disclosed
    no cause of action tenable at law.  She
    also viewed the proposed amendments as amounting to a fresh step and that to
    permit the amendments would be an abuse of process.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We share the motion judge’s view that the proposed amendments
    ought not to be allowed as they disclose no tenable cause of action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The letters at issue in this case were an exchange of
    correspondence between counsel whose respective clients were adverse in
    interest.  The general rule is that a
    lawyer owes no duty of care to the clients of opposing counsel in litigation or
    commercial matters.  A lawyer acting in
    his or her professional capacity owes a duty of care to his or her client, not
    to clients represented by opposing counsel.  As was noted by Lane&nbsp;J. in <i>Baypark Investments Inc. et al v.
    Royal Bank of Canada</i> (2002), 57 O.R. (3d) 528 (S.C.J.) at para.&nbsp;33,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>To hold otherwise would place solicitors in an
    untenable conflict between their duty to their client and their need to protect
    themselves against their client’s adversary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants’ reliance on <i>Windstar Equities Ltd. v.
    Sentinel Hills</i> [2005] O.J.&nbsp;No.&nbsp;1516 in this regard is
    misplaced.  As the motion judge
    correctly observed, in <i>Windstar</i>, the lawyer made direct representations
    to non&#8209;clients who were not represented by counsel and in circumstances
    in which the lawyer ought reasonably to have foreseen that the non&#8209;clients
    would rely on those representations.  In
    the case at bar, it would not be reasonably foreseeable that non&#8209;clients
    represented by their own lawyer would rely on representations (if any) made by
    the lawyer acting for a party adverse in interest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We accept, however, that to permit such amendments would not
    have constituted an abuse of process as any prejudice suffered by the
    respondents was compensable by costs and there was no suggestion that the
    amendments were sought for an improper purpose.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants sought to argue that s.&nbsp;1 of the <i>Negligence
    Act</i> could found the cause of action.  We fail to see how, as s.&nbsp;1 does not create a cause of action; it
    deals with contribution and indemnity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs to the
    respondents fixed at $6,000, all inclusive.</p>
