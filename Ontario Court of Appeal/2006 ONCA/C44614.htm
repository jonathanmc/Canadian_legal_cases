    appellant pleaded guilty to sexual exploitation, sexual assault and criminal
    harassment. After giving the accused seven and a half months credit for 112
    days of pre-trial custody, the trial judge sentenced him to four years imprisonment
    on each of the counts of sexual exploitation and sexual assault, to be served
    concurrently, and to 6 months imprisonment on the count of criminal harassment
    to be served consecutively.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    offences involved the appellant’s stepdaughter. The facts admitted on the
    sentencing hearing indicate that the appellant began sexually abusing his
    stepdaughter when she was between three and four years old. Save for a period
    when the complainant was between 8 and 10 years old, the conduct continued
    for fourteen years until the complainant moved away from home.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Initially,
    the abuse consisted primarily of fondling. Over time it progressed to fellatio,
    cunnilingus, digital penetration and simulated intercourse. During some periods,
    the abuse occurred on an almost daily basis. Although never physically coercive,
    the appellant manipulated and controlled the complainant through intimidation,
    both of her and of fellow family members.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the complainant left the family home, the appellant telephoned the complainant
    repeatedly both at her residence and her place of employment. He threatened
    her and on several occasions threatened to kill her dog if she did not talk
    to him or come back to visit him. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raises three issues on appeal. First the appellant claims that
    the trial judge erred in imposing a consecutive sentence on the criminal
    harassment offence. In particular, the appellant submits that because of
    the close factual nexus between all three offences, concurrent sentences
    should have been imposed. Put another way, the appellant says that the appellant
    should not have received a consecutive sentence for his coercive and harassing
    behaviour just because it became ineffective during the latter part of the
    total period of the offences. The appellant also relies on the trial judge’s
    failure to provide reasons for imposing a consecutive sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellant contends that the total effective sentence of 5 years 1½ months
    imprisonment is excessive, having regard to the appellant’s early guilty
    plea and demonstration of remorse and because the offences did not involve
    full intercourse. He suggests a total sentence of 3.5 years (4 years less
    pre-trial custody) would be appropriate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the appellant submits that the prohibition order made under s. 161 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> is overbroad and that portions of subparagraph 9(a) of that order
    should be deleted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;

    sexual assault and one count of sexual interference to be served concurrently.
    On the charge of criminal harassment the sentence was six months to be served
    consecutively.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R.

      for the majority stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            In
    my opinion, the decision to order concurrent or consecutive sentences should
    be treated with the same deference owed by appellate courts to sentencing
    judges concerning the length of sentences ordered. The rationale for deference
    with respect to the length of sentence, clearly stated in both <i>Shropshire</i> and <i>M.(C.A.)</i>,
    applies equally to the decision to order concurrent or consecutive sentences.
    In both setting the duration and type of sentence, the sentencing judge exercises
    his or her discretion based on his or her first-hand knowledge of the case;
    it is not for an appellate court to intervene absent an error in principle,
    unless the sentencing judge ignored factors or imposed a sentence which,
    considered in its entirety, is demonstrably unfit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    Sentencing, Sixth Edition<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a>,
    the authors note at paragraph 14:10:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A great deal
    of judicial time has been taken in assessing the rules as to whether sentences
    should be consecutive or concurrent in particular circumstances. The language
    used in <i>Paul</i> suggests that this task remains crucial. Logically, however,
    one cannot fault the use of concurrent sentences to reduce the aggregate
    sentence; that is quite different from the evil of an inflated “head”
    sentence.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>We have
    frequently noted that the <i>Code</i> seems to require consecutive sentences
    unless there is a reasonably close nexus between the offences in time and
    place as part of one continuing criminal operation or transaction: <i>R.
    v. Osachie</i>, (1973), 6 N.S.R. (2d) 524. This does not mean, however, that
    we should slavishly impose consecutive sentences merely because offences
    are, for example, committed on different days. It seems to me that we must
    use common sense in determining what is a “reasonably close” nexus and not
    fear to impose concurrent sentences if the offences have been committed as
    part of a continuing operation in a relatively short period of time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    authors conclude, after reviewing several examples at paragraph 14.13:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Ultimately,
    the tests are very flexible, and it becomes a fact-specific inquiry whether
    the connection between two offences is sufficiently or insufficiently close
    to merit either consecutive or concurrent sentences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the agreed statement of facts which was exhibit one on the appellant’s plea
    of guilty, it was stated that the last time the appellant sexually assaulted
    the complainant was on July 1, 2000. Thereafter the complainant moved to
    Barrie Ontario. In September, 2000 while the complainant was living with
    friends, the appellant phoned so much that the complainant had the number
    blocked. The statement went on:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            The
    accused would then use other people’s phones to get through to W.F. The accused
    called and repeatedly threatened W.F. and on several occasions threatened
    to kill her dog if she didn’t talk to him or come back … for a visit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    calls stopped in December, 2000 when the complainant moved in with her boyfriend.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge gave no reasons specifically for ordering that the sentence on
    the charge of criminal harassment was to run consecutively to the sentence
    imposed for the other changes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, however, it was open to the trial judge on the facts of this case
    to order a consecutive sentence. In her reasons for sentence, the trial judge
    referred to the criminal harassment being “an ill-fated attempt on the part
    of the accused to try to continue his sphere of influence over the complainant
    in the nastiest manner.”  This conduct occurred after the complainant had
    moved away from the appellant’s home; in some respects, it was of a different
    nature than the intimidating and manipulating conduct to which the appellant
    subjected her while they lived in the same house. Particularly in light of
    those factors, it was open to the trial judge to find that a consecutive
    sentence was, in all of the circumstances, appropriate. In effect, there
    was not the close factual nexus that would make a consecutive sentence inappropriate.
    Nor, as I will explain did it make the total sentence imposed unfit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'><b>2.         Total Sentence of 5 Years 1½  Months is Excessive</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant spent some 112 days in pre-trial custody. The trial judge credited
    him with 7½ months pre-sentence custody which is about a 2:1 ratio. She then
    sentenced him to an additional four and one half years imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s main submission is that because the appellant’s conduct fell
    short of full sexual intercourse his sentence should be reduced. It is argued
    that in breach of trust situations, a sentence of five years or more is reserved
    for offences where there was sexual intercourse and a lack of remorse. The
    appellant suggests a sentence of 3½ years is more appropriate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the Crown noted in her factum, this court in <i>R. v. Stuckless</i> (1998),
    127 C.C.C. (3d) 225 at paragraph 42 noted:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The absence
    of penetration does not automatically relegate the sexual abuse of children
    to the
    “lower range” of sexual offences. There is no question that “additional force”,
    “collateral crimes”, and penetration are aggravating factors. But their absence
    does not thereby transform them into mitigating circumstances, nor neutralize
    the other aggravating factors found in this case: the abuse of trust, the
    number of victims, the frequency of the assaults and their devastating impact
    on the lives of their victims. These offences were individually and collectively,
    unconscionable. Any characterization which purports to diminish their magnitude,
    is unacceptable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apposite
    too are the words of Moldaver J.A. in <i>R. v. D.(D.)</i>, [2002] O.J. No.
    1061 at paragraph 44:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>To summarize,
    I am of the view that as a general rule, when adult offenders, in a position
    of trust, sexually abuse innocent young children on a regular and persistent
    basis over substantial periods of time, they can expect to receive mid to
    upper single digit penitentiary terms.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the sentence imposed is at the high end of the range, I would not interfere.
    There were a number of aggravating factors here noted by the trial judge
    which made these offences particularly reprehensible. The appellant began
    to abuse the complainant his step-daughter when she was between only three
    and four years of age. The abuse continued, but for a two-year period, from
    then until she moved out of the house following her high school graduation.
    At times the abuse was a daily routine and involved a variety of sexual conduct
    falling only just short of full sexual intercourse. This was a particularly
    egregious breach of trust. </p>

line-height:normal'>[21]<span

    Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) dated July 5, 2005. She was not prepared
    on the basis of that report to find that the accused was a pedophile. Despite
    that finding the trial judge made an order under s. 161 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> prohibiting the appellant for life from:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            (a)  attending

    the accused to be a pedophile and appreciated that to a certain extent, his
    offence was committed in circumstances found to be situational. Nevertheless
    she found that a prohibition was required. It was a matter for her discretion
