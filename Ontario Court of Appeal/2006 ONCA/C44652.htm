  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the convictions entered
    by Justice Thomas J. Lally of the Superior Court of Justice on November 9, 2005
    and the sentences imposed on December 8, 2005.</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>MACPHERSON and CRONK JJ.A.:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted on November 9, 2005 of one count
    each of criminal harassment and making harassing telephone calls in relation to
    his ex-wife and two counts of breaching the terms of his probation, namely, the
    requirements that he not communicate, directly or indirectly, with his former
    wife and that he keep the peace and be of good behaviour.  He was sentenced to four months
    imprisonment, in addition to time served, to be followed by three years
    probation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his convictions.  Originally, he also appealed against
    sentence.  However, as he has served his
    sentence, he now seeks a reduction of the term of probation imposed should he
    be successful on his convictions appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is one issue.  The appellant argues that the trial judge was biased and pre-judged the
    merits of the offences charged, with the result that trial fairness was
    compromised.  We disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant relies principally on an exchange between the
    trial judge and the complainant, which occurred during the examination-in-chief
    of the complainant, when the trial judge inquired of the complainant what she
    wanted the courts to do, given the obsessive behaviour of the appellant towards
    the complainant over several years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, although the timing of this exchange and certain
    of the language employed by the trial judge was unfortunate, the impugned
    exchange does not rise to the high threshold required to establish actual bias,
    as asserted by the appellant.  We say
    this for several reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, this was a judge alone trial.  When the exchange is viewed in the context of the evidence that
    preceded it, the trial judge’s remarks may be understood as an inquiry of the
    complainant concerning the outcome she expected from the criminal justice
    system if her evidence was accepted and the crimes charged against the
    appellant were proven.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That this was the import of the trial judge’s comments and the
    manner in which they were likely understood by the parties at the time is
    evident from the fact that no objection to the exchange was taken by defence
    counsel.  Nor, on the record before this
    court, does it appear that a mistrial was sought.  It is also telling that defence counsel did not cross-examine the
    complainant on the exchange.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, this was an isolated exchange during the trial.  The remainder of the trial proceedings, as
    reflected in the transcript available to this court, does not suggest that the
    trial judge’s mind was closed to the presumption of innocence.  Indeed, the transcript discloses a number of
    comments by the trial judge that suggest sympathy to the appellant and the
    defence position.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, and importantly, the trial judge’s references to the
    appellant’s “obsession” with the complainant appear to have been based on the
    evidence of the appellant’s prior convictions, in each of 2002, 2004 and 2005,
    for similar conduct in respect of the complainant.  This evidence was admitted as part of the narrative of the
    relationship between the appellant and his ex-wife, and to assist the trier of
    fact in assessing the complainant’s claim that she lived in fear of the
    appellant.  No challenge to the
    admissibility of this evidence is made on this appeal.  This evidence, by itself, demonstrated a
    pattern of past obsessive conduct by the appellant towards the complainant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, for the reasons given, the appeal from conviction
    is dismissed.  It follows that it is
    unnecessary to deal with the sentence appeal, which, effectively, was abandoned
    by the appellant.</p>

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ARMSTRONG J.A. (Dissenting):</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have read the reasons of my colleagues, MacPherson and Cronk
    JJ.A., and, with respect, I disagree with their conclusion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As my colleagues point out, the exchange between the trial
    judge and the complainant occurred during her examination-in-chief and
    obviously before she was cross-examined.  The complainant was the main witness for the Crown.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge asked the complainant on four separate
    occasions what it was that should be done with the accused.  In one of the exchanges the trial judge told
    the complainant that putting the accused in jail “accomplishes nothing” and
    asked her “what do you want the courts to do?”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view the language of the trial judge clearly indicates
    that he had concluded not only was the accused guilty of harassment on prior
    occasions but that he was similarly guilty of the charges he was then facing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view the trial judge had made up his mind of the guilt
    of the accused before the completion of the examination-in-chief of the
    complainant.  I would therefore set
    aside his convictions and order a new trial.</p>
