      appeal concerns the </span>zero tolerance/mandatory revocation<span lang=EN-US> regime
      that applies to health care professionals in Ontario who engage in sexual
      relations with their patients.  The appellant is a physician who, commencing
      in 1992, engaged in a sexual relationship with a woman who had been his
      patient since 1988 (“the patient”).  By September 1993, the appellant and
      the patient were living together and planning to marry, although the appellant
      was already married to another woman.  Despite their sexual relationship,
      the appellant continued to treat the patient on a regular basis as her
      physician. </span></p>

    introduced a new zero tolerance/mandatory revocation regime for sexual abuse
    of patients by health care professionals, effective January 1, 1994.  The
    appellant continued a sexual relationship with the patient and also continued
    to treat her medically on a regular basis after January 1, 1994.  By early
    1997, the appellant and his patient had ceased living together.  In March
    1998, after an altercation, the appellant and the patient ceased both their
    sexual and professional relationships and she began to be treated by another
    physician. </p>

    the Discipline Committee of The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario
    (the “Discipline Committee” and the “College”, respectively) concluded that
    the zero tolerance/mandatory revocation regime applied, found the appellant
    guilty of sexual abuse, and revoked his certificate of registration.  His
    appeal to the Divisional Court was dismissed.  He appeals, with leave, to
    this court, arguing that by January 1, 1994, his relationship with the patient
    had become “spousal” in nature and that the zero tolerance/ mandatory revocation
    regime should, therefore, not apply to his conduct. </p>

    1988, when she and her children became his patients.  He acted as the patient’s
    primary care physician from 1988 until 1998 and treated her regularly and
    frequently throughout that entire period.  The appellant commenced a sexual
    relationship with the patient in 1992, which continued until 1998. </p>

    the course of treating the patient, before they began their relationship,
    the appellant frequently provided her with personal counselling.  During
    a medical appointment in 1990, the patient raised with the appellant the
    issue of her husband’s erectile dysfunction, and the appellant referred her
    husband to a specialist for assessment and treatment.  In 1991, the patient
    was having difficulty dealing with the death of her father, caring for her
    mother who was afflicted with Parkinson’s disease, and resolving difficulties
    with her marriage.  She brought these problems to the appellant and he treated
    her with psychotherapy and with a sleeping-aid drug requiring a prescription.</p>

    early 1992, while the appellant was living alone, the patient continued experiencing
    personal problems.  She told him that she was seeing a psychologist but that
    she would be interested in seeing him socially.  He invited her to his apartment
    where they had coffee, some cake, and a kiss on her departure.  A sexual
    relationship quickly developed.  The patient regularly stayed overnight at
    the appellant’s apartment.  Their apartments were in the same building and
    in late 1993 they moved into the same unit.  In July 1992, the patient started
    working at the appellant’s office.  They shared financial resources and in
    October 1992, the patient purchased the assets of the appellant’s practice
    from his trustee in bankruptcy. </p>

    the appellant was married, in approximately September 1993 he and the patient
    decided to marry once he obtained a divorce.  Shortly thereafter, they travelled
    to England to celebrate their engagement with the appellant’s family.  They
    continued to live as a couple and hold themselves out as engaged to be married.  They
    travelled together, attended social and family functions, and the patient
    adopted the appellant’s orthodox religious practices.  In October 1995, the

    patient.  Although they made numerous attempts to reconcile, the relationship

    rejected the “spousal exemption” argument:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>The legislation leaves no opportunity for discipline panels
    to “interpret” the intent of the legislators.  Sex with a patient is sexual
    abuse, regardless of whether the sexual relationship has a positive or negative
    outcome.  Dr. Rosenberg knew, or ought to have known that sex with his patient
    prior to 1994 was unacceptable.  By January 1, 1994 he knew, or ought to
    have known that such misconduct was now sexual abuse and that the public
    and the profession had adopted a zero tolerance to such behaviour.  Notwithstanding
    this knowledge, he made no effort to disengage himself from LC either personally
    or professionally. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The Committee
    also accepted the advice given by its independent legal counsel that laws
    do change from time to time requiring that changes in behaviour are necessary
    to ensure compliance with the law.  This is particularly applicable to this
    case.  Regardless of the inappropriateness of the sexual relationship in
    the first place, there is simply no justification for Dr. Rosenberg not to
    have transferred LC’s care to another physician once he was so clearly in
    breach of the accepted behaviour of his profession.  In the Committee’s opinion,
    his failure to do so is perhaps the most egregious aspect of his misconduct.</p>

      in such conduct by physicians;</span></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE><span lang=EN-US>e)            the serious, long-term

      review by the Task Force of sanctioning decisions by the College’s Discipline

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[22] The Task
    Force recommended that the penalty for “sexual violation” of a patient – i.e.,
    any physical sexual conduct – be mandatory revocation of licence for five
    years. It acknowledged this was severe, but stated the sanction was justified
    based on the foregoing considerations and the members’ conclusion that doctors
    should be held to the highest standard of conduct and accountability in this

    extensive consultation and discussion in the medical profession, the recommendations

    care professionals.  The legislation, like the Task Force recommendations,
    is clear and unambiguous: when it comes to sexual relations between a doctor
    and a patient, there is a black letter, bright line prohibition with a drastic
    sanction and no exceptions or exemptions.  The zero tolerance policy precludes
    inquiry into any explanation or excuse for the sexual activity.  A patient’s

    as they arise. The appellant submits that the legislation must be given a
    reasonable interpretation and that it would be unreasonable to apply the
    zero tolerance/mandatory revocation regime in this case given the nature
    of his relationship with the patient.  He submits that his conduct in continuing
    to treat the patient after January 1, 1994, would be more appropriately considered
    as unprofessional conduct contrary to the Canadian Medical Association <i>Code

    review of the pragmatic and functional factors in <i>Dr. Q. </i>led to the
    Supreme Court finding, at para. 39, that the appropriate standard of review
    was reasonableness <i>simpliciter</i>.  I&nbsp;reach the same conclusion
    here and note that my finding accords with a consistent line of cases regarding
    the decisions of the Discipline Committee: see e.g. <i>Devgan</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>Seidman
    v. College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario</i>,<i> </i>[2003] O.J.

    [2006] O.J. No. 948 (Div. Ct.).  I will review and apply the four pragmatic
    and functional factors described in <i>Dr. Q. </i>to explain why the Divisional

    appropriate standard of reasonableness <i>simpliciter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first factor is the statutory mechanism for review and the presence or absence
    of a privative clause.  As described in <i>Dr. Q</i>, at para. 27, “[a] statute
    may afford a broad right of appeal to a superior court or provide for a certified
    question to be posed to the reviewing court.”  Here, since the legislation
    broadly permits statutory appeals on questions of both fact and law, “a more
    searching standard of review”, as noted in <i>Dr. Q.</i>,<i> </i>at para.
    27, is required, not the highly deferential standard of patent unreasonableness.  However,
    the remaining three factors all point towards applying a deferential standard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second factor is the expertise of the tribunal relative to that of the reviewing
    court on the issue.  If the tribunal has greater expertise than the court,
    then a standard more deferential than correctness is required.  In <i>Law
    Society of New Brunswick v. Ryan</i>, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 247 at paras. 30-33,
    the Supreme Court found that despite the fact that judges would be knowledgeable
    about the standards of ethical practice for lawyers, the expertise of the
    Discipline Committee of a provincial law society favoured deference by a
    court.  Iacobucci J. explained, at para. 31, that practicing members of the
    profession “may be more intimately acquainted with” how standards of professional
    conduct “play out in the everyday practice of law” and that practicing lawyers “are
    uniquely positioned to identify professional misconduct and to appreciate
    its severity.”  Iacobucci J. also cited the professional tribunal’s “relative
    expertise generated by repeated application of the objectives of professional
    regulation set out in the Act to specific cases in which misconduct is alleged.”  Interpretation
    of the statute and its objectives in specific factual contexts “will tend
    to generate a relatively superior capacity to draw inferences from facts
    related to professional practice and also to assess the frequency and level
    of threat to the public and to the legal profession posed by certain forms
    of behaviour.”  </p>

line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Iacobucci
    J.’s reasoning is directly applicable here.  At issue are the ethical and
    professional standards of the medical profession; the Discipline Committee
    plainly has greater familiarity with those standards and their interpretation
    and application to specific fact situations than does the court, a factor
    that suggests that the court should apply a deferential standard of review
    to the Discipline Committee’s decisions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third factor is the purpose of the legislation and the provision in particular.  In <i>Ryan</i>,<i> supra </i>at
    paras. 39-40, Iacobucci J. applied the reasoning in <i>Dr. Q.</i>,<i> supra</i>,
    in terms that are directly applicable here:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In the case
    of <i>Dr. Q</i>, at para. 31, the Chief Justice confirms earlier jurisprudence
    holding that “[a] statutory purpose that requires a tribunal to select from
    a range of remedial choices or administrative responses, is concerned with
    the protection of the public, engages policy issues, or involves the balancing
    of multiple sets of interests or considerations will demand greater deference
    from a reviewing court”.  Sections 5 and 60(1) of the Act set out above clearly
    direct the Law Society to undertake a balancing exercise and require the
    Discipline Committee to choose among a range of remedial choices.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Taken as a whole,
    the legislative purpose of the Act suggests a higher degree of deference
    to decisions of the Discipline Committee.  This deference gives effect to
    the legislature's intention to protect the public interest by allowing the
    legal profession to be self-regulating.  The Law Society is clearly intended
    to be the primary body that articulates and enforces professional standards
    among its members.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Like
    the legal profession, the medical profession is also self-governing and the
    College’s Discipline Committee is called upon to decide whether or not its
    zero tolerance/mandatory revocation regime should apply in particular circumstances.  As
    in <i>Ryan</i>, <i>supra</i>, the legislature intended the Discipline Committee
    to be the primary body to articulate and enforce the ethical standards of
    the medical profession.  This factor also suggests the court owes deference
    to the Disciplinary Committee’s decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fourth factor involves the nature of the question to be decided – law, fact,
    or mixed law and fact.  In my view, the present case poses questions of both
    law and fact. There is a legal issue, namely, the proper interpretation of
    the <i>RHPA </i>zero tolerance/mandatory revocation provisions.  However,
    as that interpretive question necessarily involves a significant measure
    of professional ethical judgment, it is an issue on which curial deference
    is appropriate.  The interpretive legal issue is also bound up with the significant
    factual issue of the nature of the appellant’s relationship with his patient
    and how that relationship impacts upon the propriety of him treating her
    as his patient.  On that issue also, curial deference to the professional
    expertise of the Discipline Committee is appropriate.</p>

    central difficulty with this argument is that the term
    “spouse” has no clear definition in law that can be applied universally to
    all situations.  “Spouse” or “spousal relationship” means one thing in one
    context and something quite different in another.  There is no clear definition
    of “spouse” at common law, nor is there one single definition under the statutes
    of this province as indicated by the appendix to these reasons charting a
    variety of definitions of “spouse” used in the statutes and regulations of
    Ontario. </p>

    of January 1, 1994, the appellant lived with the patient and they planned
    to marry.  However, the appellant was still married to another woman, and
    he and the patient had only been living together for a matter of a few months
    as of January 1, 1994.  Given its short duration, the relationship between
    the appellant and the patient clearly did not meet the definition set out
    in the <i>Family Law Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3, s. 29 which is the definition
    most commonly used in other Ontario statutes with respect to the rights and
    benefits pertaining to spousal relationships:  </p>
  <p class=definition-e><span lang=EN> “spouse”
    means a spouse as defined in subsection 1 (1) [married or having in good
        faith entered into a void or voidable marriage], and in addition includes

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>It may be arguable that the appellant meets the more expansive definition set
    out in the <i>Human Rights Code</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.19, s. 10(1), since
    this definition contains no specific temporal requirement for the duration
    of the relationship: “‘spouse” <span lang=EN>means the person to whom a person
    is married or with whom the person is living in a conjugal relationship outside
    marriage.”</span> However, given the relatively short duration of the live-in
    relationship, it is a not certain that they had formed a “conjugal relationship” as
    required by the definition of
    “spouse” in the <i>Human Rights Code</i>. </p>

    Discipline Committee was plainly wary of an argument that had the potential
    to open a significant hole in the zero tolerance/ mandatory revocation provisions.  If
    a committed live-in relationship of a few months would exempt a physician,
    would one that had lasted only a few weeks or a few days?  As the respondent
    points out, accepting the submission that there is a
    “spousal exemption” would risk changing Discipline Committee sexual abuse
    hearings into inquiries about whether a “spousal relationship” existed and
    when the relationship became “spousal”, and divert attention from the central
    question posed by the legislation, namely, was there a concurrent sexual
    and physician-patient relationship.  When combined with the nature and duration
    of his relationship with the patient, the lack of definition inherent in
    the term “spouse” makes the exemption claimed by the appellant an uneasy
    fit with the clear cut, bright line approach of the <i>RHPA</i>’s zero tolerance/mandatory
    revocation regime.  </p>

    Discipline Committee may well have overly simplified its task when it stated, “[t]he
    legislation leaves no opportunity for discipline panels to ‘interpret’ the
    intent of the legislators.”  The <i>RHPA</i>, like all legislation, must
    be interpreted before it can be applied.  However, given its clear language
    and the nature of its underlying purpose, the <i>RHPA</i> leaves little room
    for interpretation when it comes to sexual relations between a physician
    and a patient.  In my view, it was not unreasonable on the facts of this
    case for the Discipline Committee to decide that the legislation simply could
    not be interpreted in a manner that would exempt the appellant from its reach. </p>

    tolerance/mandatory revocation regime does not apply to certain relationships,
    that is a matter that necessarily involves professional ethical standards – a
    matter that lies squarely within the expertise of the Discipline Committee.  Given
    the relatively short duration of the appellant’s live-in relationship with the
    patient, the extensive medical treatment he gave her following January 1,
    1994, the absence of a clear legal definition of “spouse”, and the very clear
    and unambiguous language of the <i>RHPA</i>’s zero tolerance/mandatory revocation
    provisions, it is my opinion that the Discipline Committee’s decision stands
    up to the somewhat probing examination mandated by the reasonableness <i>simpliciter</i> standard

    the <i>RHPA</i> zero tolerance/mandatory revocation provisions were unsuccessfully
    challenged as violating the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  The
    physician who challenged the legislation argued that it would be absurd to
    apply the zero tolerance/mandatory revocation policy to the hypothetical
    case of a physician who treated his spouse.  Because the legislation as worded
    contains no exemption for spouses, the physician argued that the law should
    be struck down on the ground that it was overly broad.  Both the Divisional
    Court and this court rejected that submission. </p>

    appellant relies on the judgment of the Divisional Court where Then J. stated,
    at paras. 152-54: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>The first proposed hypothetical is the situation where a physician treats
    his or her spouse.  “Patient” is not defined in the RHPA.  This means that
    Discipline Committees and the courts must interpret the meaning of “patient” in
    the context of determining whether sexual activity occurred in the professional-patient
    relationship.  It seems highly unlikely that tribunals or courts would interpret
    this term as including a physician’s spouse.  Neither the appellant nor the
    OMA provided a single disciplinary case in which the term
    “patient” was interpreted to include a physician’s spouse.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>Interpreting “patient” for the purposes of s. 51(5)2 of the Code as including
    a spouse would be an unreasonable interpretation of the legislation.  The
    sanction in s. 51(5)2 is ordered if “a panel finds a member has committed
    an act of professional misconduct by sexually abusing a patient.”  <i>It
    is far-fetched to characterize the intimate relationship between spouses
    as
    “sexual abuse” simply because a physician may have treated his or her spouse.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…The “zero tolerance” regime
    was adopted because of the power imbalance and relationship of trust between
    physician and patient.  It was recognized that in these circumstances patient
    consent to such relationships was suspect and could seriously harm vulnerable
    patients.  Prohibitions exist because of concern about the consequences for
    the mental and physical health of a patient who enters into an intimate relationship
    when vulnerable.  These concerns are not present in the case of spouses.

    this court’s judgment in <i>Mussani</i>, at para. 102, Blair J.A. agreed
    with the result suggested by Then J. but analyzed the problem in different
    terms, suggesting that the application of the zero tolerance/mandatory revocation
    provisions to physicians who treat their spouses does not rest on any exclusion
    or exemption but on whether there was a physician-patient relationship:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>While the spousal
    hypotheticals appear troubling at first blush, I agree with the conclusion
    of Then J.: “It is far fetched to characterize the intimate relationship

    physician may provide incidental medical care to his or her spouse is unlikely,

    passage quoted from the decision of the Divisional Court in <i>Mussani</i> tends
    to support the appellant’s contention that there is a
    “spousal exemption”.  However, I find it impossible to read the reasons of
    this court in <i>Mussani</i>, and in particular the italicized sentence in
    the passage I have quoted, at para. 46, as holding there to be a “spousal
    exemption”.  This court recognized that it is “unlikely” that a physician
    could be guilty of sexual abuse of a spouse.  The word “unlikely” is simply
    inconsistent with an exemption of the kind claimed by the appellant.  In
    my view, the decision of this court in <i>Mussani </i>indicates that the
    question is not to be approached on the basis of any categorical exclusion
    of spouses, but on the basis of whether or not a physician-patient relationship
    has been established, recognizing that it is unlikely that a physician-patient
    relationship will be established between a physician and his or her spouse.  The
    Discipline Committee in the present case followed that approach.  There was
    ample evidence of a physician-patient relationship: indeed, the appellant
    conceded that fact before the Discipline Committee. As the physician-patient
    relationship coincided with a sexual relationship, the Discipline Committee
    found the appellant guilty of “sexual abuse” as that offence is described
    in the <i>RHPA</i>. </p>

    at para. 72, this court recognized that there are “admitted problems with
    zero tolerance/mandatory penalty regimes” as they are “rigid” and “can lead
    to results in individual cases that are harsh, extreme, and even arguably
    unjust” when applied to “situations where there may be genuine consent to
    a relationship between mature adults, and no power imbalance or exploitation
    on the part of the health professional.”  Despite the fact that the regime
    may catch what Blair J.A. described, at para. 82, as “the relatively rare
    case of a genuinely consensual relationship” and “eliminate the defence of
    genuine consent for the purposes of the penalty imposed”, this court upheld
    the regime in recognition of the fact that it was, as noted in para. 73, “enacted
    in response to a recognized and growing problem of sexual abuse in the medical
    profession …
    to rectify a situation where discretionary sanctioning on the part of professional
    disciplinary committees and the courts had been found to be wanting.” </p>

    application of the regime to the appellant may well be harsh since his relationship
    with the patient appears to have been consensual but, as both the Discipline
    Committee and the Divisional Court noted, the appellant could have avoided
    the problem by terminating his treatment relationship with the patient.  This
    too is entirely in accord with what this court stated in <i>Mussani</i> at
    para. 79: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The fact that
    an intimate sexual relationship which began during treatment may blossom
    into a truly loving one but still lead to revocation of a health professional’s
    certificate of registration, does not necessarily make the Mandatory Revocation
    Provisions unconstitutionally broad, in the sense that they overshoot the
    legislative objectives.  <i>The health professional need only terminate the

    and regulations, but rises to prominence in significantly less than that.  <span lang=EN-US>This
    chart details how twenty-six Ontario statutes and regulations define the
    word “spouse”.  There are four general categories of definition.  The first
    category mimics the definition found in the <i>Family Law Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. F.3<i> </i>(“<i>FLA</i>”).  The second category uses the definition
    found in the </span><i>Human Rights Code</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.19 (“<i>HRC</i>”).  The
    third possibility is for the definition to be different than either the <i>FLA </i>or <i>HRC</i>.  The
    fourth possibility is for the definition to be a modified version of the
    language found in the <i>FLA</i>.  </p>
