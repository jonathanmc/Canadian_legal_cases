style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the sentencing judge did not err in imposing a total sentence of
    43 months imprisonment in addition to pre-sentence custody in relation to
    the two sets of offences for which the appellant was sentenced. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to other offences, each of the two sets of offences for which the
    appellant was sentenced included a conviction for impaired driving and a
    conviction for driving while disqualified. At the time of sentencing the
    appellant was 44 years of age. He had a lengthy record that included eight
    prior convictions for drinking and driving offences and three prior convictions
    for driving while disqualified. When this factor is coupled with the circumstances
    of these offences, the total sentence imposed is neither outside the range
    nor manifestly unfit. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    even if the sentencing judge erred by failing to recognize the existence
    of a step principle in sentencing, in our view, the fact that the appellant
    may have been shown substantial leniency on prior occasions was not a basis
    for declining to impose a fit sentence on this occasion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the Crown requested a global sentence of 44 months imprisonment less five
    months credit for time served, the sentencing judge was not bound by this
    position nor was he required to give specific reasons addressing the interests
    of the administration of justice before departing from it. On the record
    before us there is nothing to indicate that this was a negotiated plea nor
    that the appellant was specifically induced to enter pleas of guilty based
    on the sentencing position taken by the Crown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    on our review of the record, the trial judge erred in depriving the appellant
    of the usual two-for-one credit for pre-sentence custody on the basis that
    it was the appellant who requested an adjournment of the original sentencing
    day. On the original date set for sentencing the trial judge advised counsel
    of a number of authorities he proposed to rely on in relation to sentencing
    that were not referred to by counsel. In these circumstances, appellant’s
    counsel was justified in seeking an adjournment. Accordingly, we would adjust
    the sentence to reflect full two-for-one credit for pre-sentence custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on the foregoing reasons, leave to appeal sentence is granted and the sentence
    imposed is varied by reducing the sentence on the second impaired driving
    charge (i.e. the impaired driving charge contained on Information 2602) from
    eleven months imprisonment to nine and one-half months imprisonment. The
    balance of the sentence imposed shall remain in full force and effect, including
    the provision specifying that the sentence on the second impaired driving
    charge is to be served consecutively.</p>
