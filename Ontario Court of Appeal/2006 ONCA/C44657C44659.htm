  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this proceeding the Royal Bank of Canada (“RBC”) has
    sued a number of parties for damages of approximately $100 million arising out
    of a protracted fraud committed by Loren Koval and her husband, Roman Koval,
    acting through a company controlled by them, BACC Capital Corporation (“BACC”).
    The fraud involved equipment leasing transactions in respect of which no
    equipment was acquired or leased, and all of the supporting documents were
    allegedly forged.  A large part of the
    proceeds of the fraudulent transaction were expended on the Kovals’ failed medical
    facility in downtown
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto,
    Kings Health Centre, that is now bankrupt.</p>

    defendants are Société Générale (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    )
    (“SoGen”), CitiCapital Limited (“CitiCap”) and the Bank of Montreal
    (“BMO”).  Subsequently, I will review the
    allegations against these defendants on which RBC relies in support of its
    claims.  For now it is sufficient to
    indicate in broad terms the claims made by RBC against these defendants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Against SoGen, RBC claims damages for negligence,
    conversion, unjust enrichment and money had and received.  It also seeks a declaration that SoGen did
    not have the right to reverse clear a number of bank drafts and cheques through
    the Canadian Payments Association (“CPA”) on the ground that under s.&nbsp;48(1)
    of the <i>Bills of Exchange Act</i>, R.S.C.
    1985, c.&nbsp;B-4 (“<i>BEA</i>”) it was
    precluded from doing so as a result of its own negligence.  This was referred to at trial as the
    “preclusion claim”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Against CitiCap and BMO, RBC claims damages for
    conversion and money had and received.  In a “preclusion claim” similar to the one against SoGen, RBC alleges
    that BMO was precluded from reverse clearing a number of cheques because of its
    own negligence.  It also claims damages
    for negligence against CitiCap.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>SoGen, CitiCap and BMO each moved for summary judgment
    under Rule&nbsp;20 of the <i>Rules of Civil
    Procedure</i> for the dismissal of all of RBC’s claims.  With respect to some of the claims, the
    defendants alleged that there was no genuine issue for trial.  With respect to other claims, the defendants’
    position was, as the only genuine issue was a question of law, that it could be
    determined on a Rule&nbsp;20 motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following an eight day hearing, the motion judge, in
    reasons reported in (2005), 13 B.L.R. (4th) 130, dismissed some of RBC’s claims
    and permitted the remaining claims to proceed to trial.  The chart below outlines the results of the

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>RBC appeals the dismissal of its claims against SoGen
    and CitiCap for negligence, unjust enrichment and money had and received.  It also appeals the dismissal of its claims
    against BMO based on unjust enrichment, money had and received and
    preclusion.  It asks that the judgment
    below be set aside with respect to its claims that were dismissed and asks that
    these claims be sent to trial together with its claims that were not
    dismissed.  RBC also seeks leave to
    appeal the disposition on costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>SoGen and CitiCap cross&#8209;appeal from the dismissal
    of their motions to dismiss RBC’s claims for conversion and preclusion.  CitiCap also seeks leave to appeal the
    disposition of costs of its summary judgment motion.  BMO cross&#8209;appeals from the dismissal of
    its motion to dismiss RBC’s claim for conversion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would allow RBC’s appeal
    and dismiss the cross&#8209;appeals.  The
    grounds for doing so are that the motion judge committed two principal errors
    that tainted the proper determination of a Rule&nbsp;20 motion.  He reversed the onus that applies to the
    genuine issue for trial analysis and he decided the motions on the basis of a
    critical fact that he assumed to be true for the purpose of the motion.  In addition, the motion judge erred in
    dismissing RBC’s claims for negligence, unjust enrichment and money had and
    received at the pleading stage of this proceeding.  The factual matrix of the relationship between
    the parties and the Kovals spans several years, and gives rise to complex and
    difficult issues of fact and law.  In my
    view, as all of RBC’s claims are interrelated, in fairness to all of the
    parties it is inappropriate that some of the claims be decided at the pleading
    stage and that others be decided at trial on the basis of <i>viva voce</i> testimony and a complete evidentiary record.  To not interfere with the decision of the
    motion judge would result in a substantial risk of inconsistent findings.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To provide context for the issues raised both in RBC’s
    claims and on this appeal, it is necessary to provide a description of the
    lengthy and complex factual background leading up to this proceeding.  However, because there is to be a trial, I
    will limit the facts to those necessary to decide this appeal.  </p>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'>III</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the heart of RBC’s action is a massive fraud carried
    out between 1994 and 2000 during which over $100 million was removed from the
    banking system.  Part of the money has
    been restored, but most of it is lost.  The fraud was carried out by Loren Koval, aided by her husband,
    Roman.  The vehicle used to commit the
    fraud was the equipment&#8209;leasing brokerage firm that they owned,
    BACC.  The Kovals’ flight from
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    in 2000
    triggered the discovery of their fraud by SoGen, CitiCap and BMO.  Following the Kovals’ return to
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    a few
    months later, they surrendered to authorities, pleaded guilty to the fraud
    charges brought against them and received substantial prison sentences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>RBC and BMO are Schedule I banks under the <i>Bank Act</i>, S.C. 1991, ch.&nbsp;46.  SoGen is a Schedule II bank under the
    Act.  RBC, BMO and SoGen were member
    banks of the Canadian Payment Association (“CPA”).  CitiCap is the successor to Associates
    Capital Limited (“Associates Capital”) and is licensed to carry on business as
    a lender and financier.  It was not a
    member of the CPA.  At all material
    times, BACC maintained a bank account with RBC.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Loren Koval’s scheme involved using SoGen and CitiCap
    to finance fictitious transactions.  Each
    transaction purported to be a lease of high&#8209;end medical or other
    equipment by a supplier to an end&#8209;user.  Ms.&nbsp;Koval persuaded SoGen to make available credit facilities in
    the names of actual suppliers of medical equipment that she selected to
    facilitate her fraud.  SoGen issued forty&#8209;nine
    bank drafts to the purported supplies, all drawn on itself, becoming a drawer
    of each instrument within the meaning of the <i>BEA</i>.  Thus, on each occasion,
    as drawer SoGen issued a bank draft under the mistaken belief, induced by
    Ms.&nbsp;Koval’s deceit, that the face amount thereof represented the price of
    equipment being delivered to clients of BACC as end&#8209;users, which
    equipment was to secure SoGen’s advances until they were repaid by the end&#8209;users.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In reality, no such equipment was delivered to the
    represented end&#8209;users, or at all, and SoGen, as drawer, obtained no
    security interest in it.  On each
    occasion, SoGen handed the bank draft to Ms.&nbsp;Koval without ever having
    received the named payee’s authority to do so.  All of the leases, security documents and related documents were
    fabricated by Ms.&nbsp;Koval, and the signatures on the documents were
    allegedly forged by her.  SoGen was
    unaware that it was the victim of Ms.&nbsp;Koval’s fraud because, throughout
    the six years, it never made any inquiries of any “supplier” or “end&#8209;user”
    that would have unmasked the deception.  In all her dealings with SoGen, Ms.&nbsp;Koval dealt with the same
    employee, Bert Coish.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Koval perpetuated a similar fraud against
    CitiCap.  As drawer, CitiCap prepared and
    issued five cheques, drawn on its banker, BMO, as drawee, each payable to the
    same payee, Picker International Canada Inc. (“Picker”), and handed each cheque
    to Ms.&nbsp;Koval, whom it knew was not a representative of that payee, without
    Picker’s authority to do so.  Again,
    Ms.&nbsp;Koval’s deception induced CitiCap to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Upon receiving the instruments from SoGen and CitiCap,
    Ms.&nbsp;Koval placed markings on the back of each instrument.  These markings were not uniform.  The threshold factual issue in this case is
    whether the markings amounted to a forged endorsement on each instrument.  Although this issue was disputed and, as
    moving parties on the Rule&nbsp;20 motions, the defendants, as drawers, had the
    onus of establishing that each instrument bore a forged or unauthorized
    endorsement, the motion judge relieved them of this onus by assuming that each
    endorsement was forged.  RBC contends
    that the motion judge erred in making this assumption and that this error
    tainted the dismissal of the claims from which it appeals.  A closely related issue is whether the
    markings on the instruments constituted “endorsements” within the meaning of
    the <i>BEA</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each of these instruments was tendered for deposit into
    BACC’s business chequing account at the Waterdown,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State

    Ontario, branch of RBC.  Ms.&nbsp;Koval deposited a number of
    instruments together, mixing in one of the instruments at issue with legitimate
    cheques payable to BACC, and listing them on the deposit slips that she
    completed.  As the collecting bank, RBC
    accepted each of the bank drafts and cheques for deposit.  It sent each deposited instrument through the
    clearing system (“the Clearing”) maintained by the CPA to obtain the face
    amount from the drawee, and credited BACC’s account with that face amount.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On all forty&#8209;nine occasions, the drawee SoGen
    accepted the bank draft, debited its own account as drawer, and credited
    RBC.  Similarly, the drawee BMO honoured
    each of the five cheques, debited CitiCap’s account for their face amounts, and
    credited RBC.  The cancelled instruments
    were then returned to the drawers, along with account statements.  Neither SoGen nor CitiCap inspected the
    markings and endorsements on these instruments upon receiving them back through
    the Clearing.  If they had, they would
    have realized that each instrument had not been deposited to the account of the
    payee, but to the account of BACC that was controlled by the person to whom
    they had given the instrument, Ms.&nbsp;Koval.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Kovals fled
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    in October,&nbsp;2000.  When news of their disappearance reached
    SoGen and CitiCap, they investigated their dealing with them and discovered not
    only that they been victimized, but that their losses were substantial.  SoGen petitioned BACC into bankruptcy.  Unable to recover their losses from BACC, from
    the absent Kovals, from “end&#8209;users” that had not in fact executed any
    equipment leases, or from “suppliers” who knew nothing of the negotiable
    instruments that had been issued, SoGen and CitiCap looked elsewhere for a
    means to transfer their losses.  They
    found the means to do so in the rules and by&#8209;laws of the CPA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 19, 2001, SoGen returned, or caused to be
    returned, to RBC 35 bank drafts in the total face amount of $80,658,064.36,
    thereby recovering that amount from RBC.  It did so relying on s.&nbsp;49(1) of the <i>BEA</i> and the Rules of the CPA.  Section&nbsp;49(1) gives a person on whose behalf a bill is paid containing
    “a forged or an unauthorized endorsement” the “right to recover” the amount
    paid from the person to whom it was paid, in this case the Kovals or BACC, or
    from any endorser who has endorsed the bill subsequent to the forged or
    unauthorized endorsement, in this case, RBC.  Thus, an endorsement must be “forged” or “unauthorized” as a necessary
    precondition to a drawer (“the person … on whose behalf the payment is made”)
    having a right to recover the amount of the bill from a collecting bank (“any
    endorser who has endorsed the bill subsequent to the forged or unauthorized
    endorsement”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The CPA Rules facilitate the loss allocation provisions
    of the <i>BEA</i>.  They enable a drawer to cause its own bank
    (the drawee) to reverse&#8209;clear negotiated instruments to the collecting
    back and recover the face value thereof automatically, as both SoGen and
    CitiCap did.  SoGen was able to
    immediately obtain $80,658,064.36 through the clearing system which amount was
    debited to RBC’s account with the Bank of Canada.  It is the recovery of this amount that is
    central to RBC’s claims against SoGen.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In October and December 2000, CitiCap similarly caused
    BMO to reverse&#8209;clear to RBC four of the five cheques, thereby recovering
    their full face amounts of $8,723,442.50 and causing RBC’s account with the
    Bank of Canada to be debited in the same amount.  RBC seeks to recover this amount from CitiCap
    and BMO.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is RBC’s position that the “right to recover”
    available under s.&nbsp;49(1) of the <i>BEA</i> is subject to any defence that may be available to a collecting bank.  It states that it has the right to challenge,
    or resist, the drawers’ asserted right to recover by invoking s.&nbsp;48(1) of
    the <i>BEA</i>, which provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:black'>48.</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'> (1) Subject to this Act, where a signature on a bill is forged, or placed
    thereon without the authority of the person whose signature it purports to be,
    the forged or unauthorized signature is wholly inoperative, and no right to
    retain the bill or to give a discharge therefor or to enforce payment thereof
    against any party thereto can be acquired through or under that signature, <i>unless
    the party against whom it is sought to retain or enforce payment of the bill is
    precluded from setting up the forgery or want of authority</i>. [Emphasis
    added.]</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>This is the basis of RBC’s
    “preclusion claim” to which I referred earlier.  In broad terms, RBC claims that SoGen and CitiCap are precluded from
    relying on the forged or unauthroized endorsements on the instruments by their
    own negligence in issuing the instruments without engaging in the required due
    diligence.  Consequently, they could not
    rely on s.&nbsp;49(1) of the <i>BEA</i> to reverse&#8209;clear the instruments.  The facts on which the preclusion claim are
    made are virtually the same as those on which RBC bases its claim in negligence
    against SoGen and CitiCap.  As I earlier
    indicated, although the motion judge dismissed RBC’s claims based on negligence
    on the ground that there was no genuine issue for trial, he permitted its
    preclusion claims to proceed to trial because he considered that it was a novel
    claim that should not be decided at the pleading stage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>RBC alleges that SoGen and CitiCap failed to carry out
    any due diligence in respect of the Koval transactions to protect their own
    interests by detecting and preventing fraud and, consequently, were
    negligent.  It cites as examples of the
    absence of due diligence the following: giving the instruments to
    Ms.&nbsp;Koval rather than to the payees and failing to make inquiries to
    ensure that the payees received their funds; providing credit on the strength
    of lending transactions without verifying the transactions by confirming them
    with the suppliers and end&#8209;users; failing to inspect the leased equipment
    that was the security for the advances; and failing to examine the cleared
    instruments, which would have disclosed that they were deposited to the account
    of BACC and not to the accounts of the suppliers.  Thus, SoGen and CitiCap were precluded by
    their negligence from reverse&#8209;clearing the instruments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In efforts to prevent detection of the frauds being
    perpetrated on SoGen and CitiCap, and to continue extracting money from these
    financial institutions, Ms.&nbsp;Koval caused regular payments to be made by
    BACC to SoGen and CitiCap in accordance with the “repayment schedules”
    incorporated in the fabricated loan documents that she had prepared.  SoGen and CitiCap applied these repayments to
    pay down the loans that they had made, thus getting back part of the money of
    which they had been defrauded by Ms.&nbsp;Koval.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the thirty&#8209;five bank drafts that
    SoGen reverse&#8209;cleared having a face value of $80,658,064.36, SoGen had
    previously recovered payments of $18,205,861.02 from BACC as loan
    repayments.  Similarly, with respect to
    the four cheques it had reverse&#8209;cleared in the face amount of
    $8,723,442.50, CitiCap had recovered $1,062,600.00 in loan repayments from
    BACC.  It is RBC’s position that when
    SoGen and CitiCap reverse&#8209;cleared the instruments, they each effectively
    recovered amounts that exceeded their actual losses because each had received
    significant amounts in loan repayments from BACC.  Thus, SoGen obtained a double recovery of
    $18,205,861.02, and CitiCap, of $1,062,600.00.  RBC states that the double recoveries came at its expense and that SoGen
    and CitiCap were unjustly enriched in these amounts.  In other words, by reverse&#8209;clearing the
    instruments for their full face amounts, SoGen and CitiCap recovered more money
    than they had lost as a result of Ms.&nbsp;Koval’s fraud.  The motion judge dismissed RBC’s claims based
    on unjust enrichment, suggesting that the forged loan documents served as a
    juristic reason for the receipt of the impugned funds by SoGen and
    CitiCap.  However, he permitted its
    closely related claims based on conversion to proceed to trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have stated, the issue of whether the instruments
    bear forged or unauthorized endorsements is central to this action.  If one or more of the reverse&#8209;cleared
    instruments did not bear a forged or unauthorized endorsement, or an
    endorsement within the meaning of the <i>BEA</i>,
    the drawer had no “right of recovery” under s.&nbsp;49(1) of the <i>BEA</i> and, it follows, no right to have
    the instruments returned through the clearing under the CPA Rules.  On the other hand, if the instruments bear
    forged or unauthorized endorsements, RBC’s insurers may be liable to indemnify
    it for its losses on the basis of <br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>

    to establish that the endorsements were forged or unauthorized, they did not
    rely on any affidavit evidence before the motion judge.  They relied on the examinations for discovery
    of RBC’s witness, Allan&nbsp;McGale, and Ms.&nbsp;Koval.  They did not put before the court any of the
    unsworn documents and declarations consonant with the CPA’s mandated form that
    they submitted to the CPA for the purpose of reverse&#8209;clearing the
    instruments.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior to the return of their motions for summary
    judgment, SoGen and CitiCap moved before the motion judge for an order
    precluding the insurers from participating in the summary judgment motions, or,
    in the alternative, limiting their position to the issues raised and positions
    taken by RBC in responding to the Rule&nbsp;20 motions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge found, as the insurers are persons who
    will be affected by the result of the summary judgment motions, that they were
    entitled to file responding materials and facta and to participate in the
    hearing of the motions.  In reasons
    reported at [2005] O.J. No.&nbsp;2036, at paras.&nbsp;5 and 6 the motion judge
    limited the extent of their participation.  He said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>That participation must, however, be strictly
    limited to the issues arising on the Defendant Banks’ summary judgment motions
    which are <i>issues related strictly to whether the claims made by RBC in its
    Amended Statement of Claim establish genuine issues for trial as against the
    Defendant Banks</i>.  Other claims made
    by the Insurers against the Defendant Banks in their cross claims are not
    issues arising on the summary judgment motions and are not issues which may be
    raised by the Insurers in responding to the summary judgment motions or to
    which the Defendant Banks need reply on the summary judgment motions.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Accordingly, an order will issue that the Insurers
    may file responding materials and facta on the summary judgment motions but may
    not in their responding materials or affidavits in support thereof adduce any
    facts which are not strictly relevant to the claims asserted by RBC in its
    Amended Statement of Claim and may not advance in their facta or in their
    submissions on the hearing of the summary judgment motions any legal arguments
    that are not strictly relevant to the claims asserted by RBC in its Amended
    Statement of Claim. In particular, in view of the fact that the claims of RBC
    and the cross claims of the Insurers are diametrically opposed on the question
    of forged endorsements on the instruments that are the subject matter of this
    action.  [<i>sic</i>] For the purposes of
    the summary judgment motions, RBC has asserted that the endorsements were
    forged and the Defendant Banks have accepted this assertion even though RBC in
    one paragraph of its Amended Statement of Claim makes an alternative claim
    based on the endorsements not being forged.  <i>Accordingly, the Insurers may not, in their responding motion records
    or affidavits in support or in their facta or submissions at the hearing,
    adduce any facts or advance any legal arguments to support the proposition that
    the endorsements on the instruments were not forged</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'>V</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is RBC’s position, which is supported by its
    insurers, that the motion judge made two fundamental errors each of which is sufficient
    for this court to allow its appeal, dismiss the cross&#8209;appeals and send
    its action to trial for disposition on a full factual record.  If these errors did not taint the hearing of
    the Rule&nbsp;20 motions, RBC contends that the motion judge erred in dismissing
    its claims in negligence, unjust enrichment and money had and received.  It submits that we should reverse the motion
    judge’s dismissal of these claims and permit them to go to trial together with
    its claims in preclusion (other than as against BMO) and conversion which the
    motion judge did not dismiss.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the motion judge’s first error, RBC contends, in
    stating that on a Rule&nbsp;20 motion the responding party must lead evidence
    to show that there is a genuine issue for trial, that the motion judge erred in
    reversing the onus and thereby committed an error in law.  The second error in law made by the motion
    judge was in deciding the summary judgment motions on the assumption that the
    endorsements were forged on the thirty&#8209;five instruments that SoGen caused
    to be reverse&#8209;cleared.  In my view,
    RBC is correct in asserting that the motion judge made these errors.  As the errors went to the core of the hearing
    of a Rule&nbsp;20 motion, they are determinative of RBC’s appeal and the
    lenders’ cross&#8209;appeals.  As well,
    although it is unnecessary to do so for the purpose of deciding the appeal, I
    agree with RBC’s submission that the motion judge erred in dismissing its
    claims in negligence, unjust enrichment and money had and received.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On three occasions in his reasons for judgment the
    motion judge erred in reversing the onus.  In discussing the role of a motion judge on a Rule&nbsp;20 motion, at
    para.&nbsp;19 the motion judge stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It has often been said that the onus is on the
    moving party to establish no genuine issue for trial or that the only genuine
    issue is a question of law.  The
    responding party must, however, “put its best foot forward” and <i>lead
    evidence to show that there is a genuine issue for trial</i> or that the issue
    is not strictly a question of law.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Elsewhere in his reasons for judgment the motion judge
    made the same error.  In dismissing RBC’s
    claim for unjust enrichment, at para.&nbsp;27 he stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Accordingly, in my view, <i>RBC is unable to
    establish</i> either a corresponding deprivation or the absence of any juristic
    reason for SoGen and CitiCap to receive the payments and I find no genuine
    issue for trial with respect to the claims of RBC for unjust enrichment as
    against SoGen and CitiCapital.  [Emphasis

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Summarizing his findings in para.&nbsp;91 and dealing
    with RBC’s claims for unjust enrichment and money had and received, the motion
    judge wrote that he found no genuine issue for trial with respect to these
    claims as RBC had failed to establish the requisite elements.  In addition, in para.&nbsp;5 of his reasons
    deciding the earlier motion to preclude the insurers’ participation in the
    Rule&nbsp;20 motions, which I have reproduced in para.&nbsp;29, the motion
    judge also erroneously identified the responding party’s onus on a Rule&nbsp;20
    motion when he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[The insurer’s] participation must … be strictly
    limited to the issues arising on the Defendant Banks’ summary judgment motions

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The law is settled that on a Rule&nbsp;20 motion the
    onus is always on the moving party to satisfy the court that there is no
    genuine issue for trial with respect to a claim or a defence: <i>Aguonie v. Galion Solid Waste Material Inc.</i> (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 161 (C.A.); <i>Dawson

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Summary judgment, valuable as it is for striking

    the motion judge erred in holding that on a Rule&nbsp;20 motion there is an
    onus on the responding party to establish that there is a genuine issue for
    trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moving to RBC’s second fundamental ground for appeal,
    it was argued that the motion judge erred in deciding the motion on the basis
    of assumed facts.  He assumed that the
    endorsements on the instruments issued by the lenders were forged.  The origin of this assumption is found in the
    passage from the motion judge’s reasons in the motion brought by SoGen and
    CitiCap to prelude the participation of the insurers in their Rule&nbsp;20
    motions, which I have quoted in para.&nbsp;29.  In para.&nbsp;13 of his reasons in this appeal, the motion judge made
    reference to his ruling on the earlier motion.  He referred to it again in para.&nbsp;30:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>As stated above, my ruling was that these
    motions would proceed on the basis that all of the subject bank drafts and
    cheques bore forged endorsements</i>.  RBC has, in effect, pleaded in the alternative that if the endorsements
    on certain of the instruments were authorized and accordingly, there was no
    forgery, SoGen and BMO could be liable in conversion as a result of the reverse
    clearing of such instruments.  In that
    respect, there is, in my view, clearly a genuine issue for trial as to the
    circumstances surrounding the Picker Authorization [in respect to the CitiCap
    instruments] or any other purported authorization given to BACC to execute
    endorsements on the instruments.  In the
    submissions made to this court it is clear that there is conflicting evidence
    with respect to the Picker Authorization including its interpretation, purpose
    and delivery and so as to whether it was any way relied upon and with respect
    to the issue of whether certain of the subject instruments bore authorized
    endorsements by BACC.  <i>These motions
    are, however, proceeding on the assumption that all of the subject instruments
    bore forged endorsements</i>.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I earlier stated, the issue of whether the
    instruments bear forged or unauthorized endorsements is central to the
    resolution of this action.  If one or
    more of the returned instruments bore no forged payee endorsement, or a payee
    endorsement that was authorized, the drawer had no “right to recovery” under
    s.&nbsp;49(1) of the <i>BEA</i> and, thus,
    no right to cause those particular instruments to be reverse&#8209;cleared to
    RBC through the Clearing under the CPA Rules.  Conversely, if the instruments do bear forged or unauthorized
    endorsements, then RBC’s insurers may be liable to indemnify it under their
    insurance contracts.  In allowing the
    motion to be argued on the assumption that all the endorsements were forged,
    the motion judge made an additional error with respect to the issue of which party
    bears the onus on a Rule&nbsp;20 motion.  He failed to recognize that the onus of establishing that an instrument
    bears a forged endorsement lies on the person asserting it – the drawers, SoGen
    and CitiCap.  If this onus had been
    applied, as it should have been, they would have borne the burden of
    establishing that assertion on an instrument&#8209;by&#8209;instrument basis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By proceeding on the assumption that the endorsements
    were forged and dismissing RBC’s claims in negligence, unjust enrichment and
    money had and received, the motion judge prevented RBC from advancing its core
    defences before a trial judge on the basis of a full evidentiary record.  The motion judge’s assumption that the
    endorsements were forged precluded both RBC and its insurers from presenting
    evidence capable of demonstrating that there was a genuine issue for trial
    concerning the  authenticity of the endorsements.  Moreover, they were also precluded from
    presenting evidence relevant to their alternative position that some or all of
    the endorsements were not an endorsement within the meaning of ss.&nbsp;55&#8209;57,
    59(3), 61(1), 62 and 130 of the <i>BEA</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the last point, I would add that the
    interpretation of “endorsement” under the <i>BEA</i> and the CPA Rules has yet to be the subject of considered and authorative
    judicial pronouncement.  As a legal issue
    of first impression, it should be determined in the light of facts established
    at a trial:  <i>Spasic Estate v. Imperial Tobacco Ltd</i>. (2000), 49 O.R. (3d) 699
    (C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2000] S.C.C.A. No. 547; <i>Bendix Foreign Exchange Corp v. Integrated

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Deciding a Rule&nbsp;20 motion on assumed facts is
    contrary to this court’s direction that on a Rule&nbsp;20 motion all of the
    evidence that could be led at trial should be before the court.  As this court stated in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    <i>Dawson</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para.&nbsp;17: “At the
    summary judgment stage, the court wants to see what evidence the parties have
    to put before the trial judge, or a jury, if a trial is held.”  However, the motion judge prevented RBC, as
    well as its insurers, from presenting the evidence they would present at
    trial.  In my view, it is unfair to
    dismiss a litigant’s claim and to deprive the litigant of its right to a trial
    on the basis of an artificially curtailed record.  Moreover, by artificially restricting the
    record on the summary judgment motions, the trial judge created a real risk of
    conflicting decisions on the same factual and legal issues within the same
    action were this court not to interfere.  This is because the facts and legal issues with respect to RBC’s various
    claims are so intertwined that it is logically impossible to confine the facts
    and legal issues to the several discrete claims that together constitute RBC’s
    lawsuit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two decisions of this court explain why it is a
    reversible error for a motion judge to decide a Rule&nbsp;20 motion on the
    basis of assumed facts: <i>Chitel v. Bank of
    Montreal</i>, [1999] O.J. No. 3988 (C.A.); <i>Law
    Society of Upper Canada v. Ernst &amp; Young</i> (2003), 65 O.R. (3d) 577
    (C.A.); leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2003] S.C.C.A. No. 358.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Ernst &amp;
    Young</i>, the defendants Ernst &amp; Young moved under Rules&nbsp;20 and 21
    for a determination of whether the plaintiffs’ claims for damages, as a matter
    of law, were a recoverable loss.  The
    parties agreed that the motion judge should decide the issue on the basis of
    facts that were assumed to be true for the purposes of the motion.  These facts, as pleaded in the statement of
    claim, were that the defendants were negligent and in breach of their contracts
    to the plaintiffs, and had negligently misrepresented certain facts.  The motion judge agreed to do so and
    dismissed Ernst &amp; Young’s Rule&nbsp;21 motion.  Under Rule&nbsp;20, however, success was
    divided and both sides appealed.  On the
    appeal this court set aside the judgment below in its entirety, and ordered
    that the entire action should proceed to trial.  In so holding, this court held that the motion judge had erred in
    acceding to the parties’ request that the motions be decided on the basis of
    assumed facts.  What this court said in
    paras.&nbsp;21&#8209;23 is particularly relevant to this appeal:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The defendants moved under rule 20.04(4) and,
    alternatively, under rule 21.01(1)(a), to obtain an order either dismissing the
    plaintiffs’ action or striking out their statement of claim on one, or both, of
    two legal grounds.  It was their position
    that the plaintiffs did not sustain legally recoverable damages; however, if
    they did, the plaintiffs were precluded from recovering the damages because the
    LSUC passed on the damages to its members through supplemental and increased
    annual levies.  Doctrinally, unless there
    were no facts in dispute, the defendants could not rely on rule 20.04(4), which
    permits the court to determine a question of law where it is the only genuine
    issue for trial: <i>Dawson v. Rexcraft Storage and Warehouse Inc. </i>(1998),
    164 D.L.R. (4th) 257 (Ont. C.A.).  <i>However,
    as the motion judge noted at p. 216, the parties had conceded there were
    material facts in dispute and a genuine issue for trial concerning the
    defendants’ liability.  Consequently, to
    permit the questions of law to be decided the defendants conceded that the
    plaintiffs could prove their alleged breach of contract, negligence and
    negligent misrepresentation.  However,
    they did so only for the purpose of their motions.</i>  Similarly, it would not have been appropriate
    for the motion judge to decide as a question of law under rule 21.01(1)(a) that
    the passing on defence precluded the plaintiffs from recovering the damages
    that they claimed if there was a factual issue whether the plaintiffs had
    sustained damages based on the defendants’ alleged wrongful conduct: <i>cf.
    Lennon v. Ontario (Premier) </i>(1999), 45 O.R. (3d) 84 (S.C.J.). </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>It
    follows that because there were facts in dispute concerning the defendants’
    alleged wrongful conduct, which facts the defendants were prepared to assume in
    the plaintiffs’ favour but only for the purpose of their motions, <i>the motion
    judge was put in the position of being asked to decide two hypothetical
    questions.</i>  Of course, had the
    defendants been prepared to admit for all purposes that they had breached their
    contracts with the plaintiffs or had performed their services negligently, that
    would have removed the hypothetical nature of the questions of law raised by
    their motions.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Moreover, it appears from the reasons of the motion
    judge, as well as from the factums of the parties and the oral submissions of
    counsel that many underlying facts are in dispute.  <i>This reinforces the importance of deciding
    significant substantive issues on a full factual background that forms the
    complete picture.  Such factual
    background can best be developed at trial, rather than on an interlocutory
    motion.</i>  I refer, for example, to the
    dispute among the parties as to the nature of the Insurance Plan, the role of
    the LSUC and LPIC in respect to the Insurance Plan and, in particular, their
    responsibility for liabilities and expenses they incurred in connection with
    the Insurance Plan.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After reviewing a number of authorities, the court
    continued at para.&nbsp;46:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>To succeed in this action, the plaintiffs must
    prove that one or both of the defendants were either in breach of contract or
    negligent, or both, and that as a result the plaintiffs sustained legally
    recoverable damages.  Should the
    plaintiffs prove the alleged wrongful conduct, for the defendants to avoid
    paying damages they must persuade the court that their breach of contract or
    negligence did not cause the plaintiffs to sustain damages, or if their
    wrongful conduct caused damages to the plaintiffs, that they are precluded from
    recovering them because the damages were passed on to the members of the
    LSUC.  Central to any recovery by the
    plaintiffs is whether they can prove that the defendants were in breach of
    contract or negligent, which allegations are denied by the defendants in their
    statements of defence.  Although the
    defendants did not specify the particulars of their breach of contract or their
    negligence, they asked the motion judge to assume for the purpose of the motion
    only that they were in breach of contract or negligent.  However, the defendants’ concession of their
    liability for the purpose of the motion necessarily contains a concession that
    they committed the underlying acts, which the plaintiffs allege in their
    statement of claim.  <i>As the above
    cases illustrate, because the motion judge’s legal analysis was informed by the
    defendants’ concession of their alleged wrongful conduct, it is not possible to
    say that any of the legal results that flow from the motion judge’s order will
    survive a revision of the facts at the trial that is to be held consequent to
    the motion judge’s order.  As the
    defendants’ motion was dismissed, there must be a trial at which the facts as
    found by the trial judge may differ from the facts assumed for the purpose of
    the motions.  This possible revision of
    the facts on the basis of a complete trial record graphically demonstrates the
    hypothetical nature of the </i><i><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:TimesNewRoman;'>questions of law that
    the motion judge was asked to decide. </span></i><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:TimesNewRoman;'> It is not the purpose of rule
    21.01(1)(a) to enable a party to obtain the advisory opinion of the court as to
    the validity of its cause of action or defence where the facts that constitute
    the substratum thereof are in dispute.  [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What this court said in <i>Chitel</i> is also instructive.  In that case the motion for summary judgment was decided on the basis of
    facts admitted only for the purpose of the motion.  This court said that the problem of deciding
    a motion on the basis of facts admitted for the purpose of a motion could place
    the trial judge in a difficult position if he or she were to make a different
    finding of fact based on the evidence.  This is a definite possibility in this case if we do not interfere with
    the decision reached by the motion judge on the assumption that the
    endorsements were forged because in the two claims which the motion judge
    ordered should go to trial – preclusion and conversion – it will be necessary
    for the trial judge to make findings with respect to each endorsement.  Clearly, there is bound to be a conflict.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In allowing the appeal from the order granting summary
    judgment, the <i>Chitel</i> court stated at
    paras.&nbsp;10 and 11:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Besides this problem, it is unclear from the record
    and the reasons, what facts were found not to be in dispute in order to form
    the basis for the legal conclusions reached by the motions judge.  <i>Rather, it appears that many important
    facts, as well as inferences from the facts, are very much in dispute in this
    case and that they are part of a complete story which must be told in its
    entirety at the trial.  Furthermore,
    because the entire legal analysis was based on, and flowed from, at least one
    of the facts conceded for the motion only, it is not possible to say that any
    of the legal results would survive a revision of the facts.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This is not a case for partial summary judgment
    eliminating any of the claims.  <i>Both
    the facts and the legal issues are complex and require a trial where they can
    be considered as a whole by one judge who will apply the law to the facts as
    ultimately found.</i>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both <i>Ernest &amp;
    Young</i> and <i>Chitel</i> clearly
    illustrate why the motion judge should not have decided the financial
    institutions’ motions for summary judgment on the assumption that the
    endorsements were forged.  From the
    perspective of all of the parties, including the insurers, the authenticity of
    each endorsement was in dispute, as well as the threshold issue of whether the
    markings on the instruments were endorsements within the meaning of the <i>BEA</i>.  It is important to recognize that this proceeding is not solely between
    RBC and SoGen, CitiCap and BMO.  It also
    includes RBC’s claims against its insurers, who in turn, have issued cross&#8209;claims
    against the lenders.  Rather, the facts
    in this complex case, in which RBC’s claims are interrelated, must be found in
    the usual way by a trial judge who will decide the issues raised in this appeal
    on a full evidentiary record.  Each claim
    is to be decided on the basis of the governing legal principles applied to the
    factual findings.  Accordingly, I would
    give effect to this ground of appeal.  As
    in <i>Ernest &amp; Young</i>, the judgment
    below must be set aside in its entirety and the entire action should proceed to
    trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would allow RBC’s appeal, dismiss the
    cross&#8209;appeals of SoGen, CitiCap and BMO, set aside the judgment of the
    motion judge and order that the entire action proceed to trial.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'>VI</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although I have decided the appeal and the cross&#8209;appeals
    for the above reasons, because considerable argument was directed to the motion
    judge’s dismissal of RBC’s claims based on negligence, unjust enrichment and
    money had and received, I feel that it is appropriate to comment briefly on the
    motion judge’s summary dismissal of these claims.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his analysis of RBC’s negligence claims against
    SoGen and CitiCap, the motion judge was dealing with a novel claim.  There has been no judicial consideration of
    the duty of care owed by the drawer of an instrument to a collecting back.  He rejected RBC’s submission that he should
    follow the position of this court, as articulated in such cases as <i>Spasic Estate</i>,<i> supra</i> and <i>Bendix Foreign
    Exchange Corp.</i>, <i>supra</i>, that
    matters of law which are not settled, or have not had the benefit of
    contemporary judicial consideration, should not be determined at the
    interlocutory stage but should be sent to trial to be determined on a full
    factual record.  See, also, <i>R. D. Belanger &amp; Associates Ltd. v.
    Stadium Corporation of Ontario Ltd.</i> (1991), 5 O.R. (3d) 778 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ); <i>Romano
    v. D’Onofrio</i> (2005), 77 O.R. (3d) 583 (

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  Ultimately, the motion judge granted the
    respondents’ motions for summary judgment on the ground that no duty of care
    was owed due to a lack of proximity between the banks on which the instruments
    were drawn and RBC as the collecting bank.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge granted the respondents’ motion to
    dismiss RBC’s claim in unjust enrichment based on the windfall obtained by
    SoGen and CitiCap pursuant to the “lease payments” they received from
    Ms.&nbsp;Koval in her attempt to mask her fraud.  In my opinion, the motion judge erred in his
    view that the fictitious leases created by Ms.&nbsp;Koval constituted a
    juristic reason for SoGen and CitiCap to have received these funds and to deny
    RBC recovery: <i>Garland v. Consumers’ Gas
    Co.</i>, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 629.  Moreover,
    the broader issue arising from RBC’s unjust enrichment claim, of whether excess
    funds obtained through resort to the procedures of the CPA Rules are subject to
    restoration under restitutionary principles, like the duty of care issue, is a
    novel issue that has not had the benefit of contemporary judicial scrutiny and
    which remains unsettled.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the motion judge erred in failing to apply
    the decisions of this court when he dismissed RBC’s novel claims in negligence
    and unjust enrichment at the interlocutory stage rather than sending them to
    trial.  As RBC’s claim for money had and
    received closely parallels its claim for unjust enrichment it too should not
    have been dismissed.  The motion judge
    should have permitted it to go to trial with the other claims.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge was aware of the principle that novel
    claims should not be determined at the interlocutory stage.  He sought to distinguish <i>Bendix</i> by suggesting that recent unnamed Supreme Court of Canada
    decisions had “expanded” the role of a judge hearing a Rule&nbsp;20 motion
    “where the only genuine issue is a question of law” that involves applying
    “established” legal principles to new fact situations.  However, indicative of an inconsistency in
    his application of the principle that novel claims should be determined at
    trial, he applied it when he dismissed SoGen and CitiCap’s motions to dismiss
    RBC’s conversion claim, stating at para.&nbsp;41:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, the claim in conversion against the
    Defendant Banks as a result of the reverse clearing of the subject bank drafts
    and cheques through the CPA clearing system raises novel issues on which there
    is no definitive authority and are questions of law which should go to trial on
    a full record and accordingly constitute genuine issues for trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although in the final analysis the motion judge sent
    RBC’s preclusion claims to trial because they raised evidentiary and legal
    issues that could not be decided on a summary judgment motion, in my view, from
    reading his analysis of this issue, he was also concerned about apparent novel
    aspects of the preclusion claims.  I find
    what the motion judge said in para.&nbsp;87 about the state of the record on
    the preclusion claim to be instructive:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>I am of the view that
    there is not a full factual record before this court as to the manner in which
    the bank accounts of SoGen and CitiCapital were operated, the manner in which
    the subject bank drafts and cheques were drawn, issued and delivered to BACC
    and the lack of due diligence on the part of SoGen and CitiCapital with respect
    to the lease transactions.  There would
    have to be further evidence before this court in this regard.  There would also have to be additional expert
    evidence to determine whether such conduct constituted negligence on the part
    of SoGen and CitiCapital and to determine whether such conduct was “in the
    transaction itself” and whether it was the proximate cause of RBC’s loss.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>In my view, what the motion judge stated
    with respect to the deficiencies in the record relating to the preclusion
    claims must necessarily apply to the record with respect to RBC’s negligence
    claims, which are essentially based on the same facts, and constitute further
    reasons why the negligence claims should have been sent to trial.  </p>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'>VII</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For all of the above reasons, I would allow RBC’s
    appeal and dismiss the cross&#8209;appeals of SoGen, CitiCap and BMO, set aside
    the judgment of the motion judge, substitute a judgment dismissing all of the
    motions for summary judgment and order that RBC’s entire action proceed to
    trial.  I would award RBC its costs of
    the motions.  Failing agreement by the
    parties on the amount of costs, I would order that they be assessed.  RBC is to have its costs of the appeal on a
    partial indemnity basis fixed in the amount of $85,000, inclusive of
    disbursements and GST.</p>
