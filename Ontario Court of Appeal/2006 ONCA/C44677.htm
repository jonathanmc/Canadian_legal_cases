style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are two central issues raised by these appeals from an order made by Forget&nbsp;J.
    in connection with proceedings under the <i>Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal
    Matters Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 30 (4th Supp.).  In the first appeal, Robert
    Foster et al. [the “collectors”] argue that Forget J. had no jurisdiction
    to make an evidence-gathering order under s. 18 of the Act when the effect
    of that order was a search and seizure of their collection of Rodin plasters,
    then under the control of the MacLaren Art Centre in Barrie, Ontario.  In
    the second appeal, the Attorney General of Canada argues that Forget J. had
    no jurisdiction to attach certain conditions to the sending order that he
    made under s. 20 of the Act. The impugned conditions relate to an obligation
    to pay for the storage of the plasters and related costs as well as an obligation
    to indemnify the collectors for damage caused during the carrying out of
    the order. The Attorney General of Canada also argues that the application
    judge erred in awarding costs of the application to the collectors and the
    MacLaren.  The Attorney General of Ontario intervenes in support of the positions
    taken by the Attorney General of Canada.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the following reasons, I would dismiss the collectors’
    appeal and allow the appeal by the Attorney General of Canada.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>I.          THE

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    appeals concern works by the renowned French sculptor, Auguste Rodin.  The
    process followed by Rodin was to create a mold for a sculpture in plaster.  The
    sculpture in plaster would then be cast in bronze at a foundry.  While a
    single plaster could create several bronzes, eventually the founding process
    would wear upon a plaster and a new plaster would have to be produced.  The
    new plaster was created by casting a mold from a plaster that was still in
    good condition.  In the result, there can be a number of plasters and bronzes
    of the same statue.  Both plasters and bronzes are displayed in museums throughout
    the world.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
    1902 until 1952, the Rudier foundry was the exclusive founder of Rodin’s
    work.  After 1952, the Rudier shared rights with other foundries.  The Musée
    Rodin is an organ of the French state, established to perpetuate Rodin’s
    works and to hold the intellectual property rights relating to them.  When
    Rodin died, he gifted his remaining unsold works to the French state.  The
    Musée has a <i>de facto</i> monopoly over the creation of high quality bronze
    reproductions of Rodin’s works from the plasters in its possession.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(2)       The
      Collection</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    collection in issue consists of twenty-eight Rodin plasters, which the collectors
    purchased in 2000 and 2001.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a>  The
    collectors assert that there is no dispute about the provenance of the collection.  They
    say that the plasters came from the Rudier foundry and that previously the
    Musée has confirmed the provenance of the collection.  The collection has
    been exhibited at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto and at the </p>
  <br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>MacLaren.  The collectors originally intended to donate the collection to the
    MacLaren but that transaction has never been completed.  The collection remains
    at the MacLaren or in storage facilities under its control.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(3)       The
      Dispute</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    the collectors purchased the collection, it was exhibited in Italy in 1999
    and 2000.  It appears that at this time the Musée began to take an interest
    in the collection, although it did nothing to block its subsequent sale to
    the collectors or the export of the collection to Canada.  When, however,
    the collection was exhibited at the ROM, the Musée, in the words of the collectors, “decided
    to stir up a controversy”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    collectors assert that this controversy is nothing more than an attempt by
    the Musée to protect its economic interests in reproducing bronze castings
    of Rodin works.  France asserts that the Musée has legal rights over all
    original plasters and sculptures and that it needs the plasters to pursue
    an investigation of a corporate entity and an individual that it suspects
    of various offences in relation to Rodin plasters and bronzes.  France alleges
    that the collection was sold by this corporate entity to the collectors.  As
    I understand it, the allegation is, in part, that the collection is not composed
    of “originals” but
    “reproductions” and may have been sold under false pretences.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2001, France requested Canada’s assistance in pursuing its investigation
    and initially wanted the Canadian police to seize the collection so that
    it could be examined and authenticated by a recognized Rodin expert.  France
    also wanted to interview various witnesses including officials from the ROM
    and the MacLaren.  The federal Department of Justice suggested a consensual
    process and contacted the MacLaren to attempt to agree on an expert to examine
    the collection.  The MacLaren suggested two recognized Rodin experts.  For
    reasons that are not germane to this appeal, little progress was made on
    the file until June 2004 when the collectors wrote directly to counsel with
    the Department of Justice indicating that they would consent to an inspection
    of the collection by an expert “subject to presentation to us of the name
    and CV of the proposed expert”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    October 4, 2004, France sent to the Department of Justice the name and CV
    of Gilles Perrault as its proposed expert.  Almost two weeks later the Department
    sent this material to the collectors.  A short time later, the collectors
    learned that the Department intended to go ahead with an inspection of the
    collection in early November, apparently without the consent of the collectors.  On
    November 4, 2004, the collectors’ counsel wrote to the counsel in the Department
    who was handling this file and told her that they would not consent to an
    examination by M. Perrault because, in their view, he was not qualified.  Their
    view was that M. Perrault, although perhaps an expert in restoration of medieval
    ecclesiastical sculpture in wood, had no expertise in nineteenth century
    French sculpture, such as the works by Rodin.  The collectors’ counsel also
    noted a previous indication that the Department might proceed by way of an
    application for an evidence-gathering order under the Act.  He set out various
    objections to that procedure and claimed that there was no jurisdiction to
    obtain an evidence-gathering order.</p>

    November 16, 2004, counsel for the Attorney General of Canada (not Ms.&nbsp;Henchey)
    obtained an <i>ex parte</i> evidence-gathering order under s. 18 of the Act<i> </i>from
    Forget J. (the application judge).  The application was supported by an affidavit
    of Constable Bédard of the RCMP.  The affidavit did not disclose that the
    collectors objected to the proposed expert or that they disputed the court’s
    jurisdiction to make the evidence-gathering order.  The tenor of the affidavit
    suggested that the procedure was consensual, at least on the part of the
    MacLaren.  Copies of the order were provided to the MacLaren and to the persons
    in charge of the other facilities where the collection was being stored the
    day the order was made.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 30, 2004, counsel for the collectors wrote counsel for the Department.  It
    is apparent that the collectors’ counsel had become aware of a court order.  He
    was, however, uncertain which court had made the order and in his letter
    stated that he believed the order was issued by the Quebec Superior Court.  He
    also recounted a telephone conversation in which counsel for the Department
    (not Ms. Henchey) would neither confirm nor deny the existence of any order
    because the collectors were no longer co-operating.  Counsel for the Department
    did not respond to this letter.</p>

    December 3, 2004, counsel for the Attorney General of Canada again appeared
    before the application judge and obtained an amended order that corrected
    the address of the MacLaren.  On December 17, 2004, new counsel for the collectors
    wrote to the Regional Senior Judge to ask her to intervene to ensure that
    the Attorney General of Canada did not take further steps without notice
    to the collectors.  At this point, counsel for the Attorney General resumed
    communication with the collectors’ counsel.  The record is silent as to whether
    the MacLaren provided copies of the order and amended order to the collectors.</p>

    available to M. Perrault so that he could examine them, including take micro-samples
    and conduct micro-tests, “in order to prepare a report on the authenticity,
    origin and ownership of the bronzes [<i>sic</i>] and plasters”.</p>

    under s. 18(2)(c) of the Act to receive from M. Perrault all things, documents,
    notes and other media relating to the information that he collected during
    his examination.  The documents and things were to remain sealed and were
    to be brought before a judge at the application for a sending order.  M.
    Perrault was to destroy any other notes, photos, or other information gathered
    during the examination of the plasters.</p>

    Perrault examined the plasters for several days in November and December,
    2004. Constable Bédard was present during the examination, as were employees
    of the MacLaren.  During the examination some small pieces came off the plasters.  The
    parties cannot agree on whether the examination damaged the plasters.  The
    Attorney General of Canada says that they were not damaged.  The collectors
    say they were damaged.  They also assert that the examination conducted by
    M. Perrault was misconceived and inappropriate.  For example, he took micro-samples
    and swabbed the plasters.  An expert retained by the collectors says that
    these procedures could not yield any useful information.</p>

    the application judge stated that during the examination by M. Perrault “certain

    of the sending order that the applicant indemnify the owners for any damage
    to the plasters, including the expense of repairs occasioned by M. Perrault’s
    inspection.  The application judge did not give any express reasons for the
    term of the sending order that the applicant pay reasonable costs of storage
    and insurance while the plasters were subject to the impounding order.  However,
    he said the following in relation to the costs of the application:</p>

    Respondents herein.  I am of the view that an adequate amount for costs should

    single issue of whether there was jurisdiction to make the evidence-gathering
    order under s. 18 of the Act when, in effect, the Attorney General of Canada
    sought a search and seizure.  They do not challenge the evidentiary basis
    for making the evidence-gathering order.  The collectors say that the evidence-gathering
    order had all the attributes of a search and seizure:  the plasters were
    impounded, the owners were denied access to them, and the plasters were subjected
    to a damaging inspection.  They submit that impounding and inspection are
    not authorized by s. 18.  The collectors say that, accordingly, the Attorney
    General of Canada should have been required to comply with the more rigorous
    standards for obtaining a search warrant under s. 12 of the Act.  They also
    say that they were denied the safeguards normally attending an evidence-gathering
    order because of the nature of inspection that took place.  Finally, as I
    understand it, the collectors submit that they were denied the protection
    of having a Canadian police officer execute the search warrant.  </p>

    the following reasons, it is my view that the application judge did have
    jurisdiction to make the evidence-gathering order under s. 18 of the Act.  I
    am also of the view that, while there are several defects in that order,
    the judge did not err in making the sending order under s. 20 of the Act.
    For ease of reference I have attached ss. 18 and 20 of the Act in an Appendix.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    collectors say that the combined effect of the terms of the evidence-gathering
    order in this case is, in substance, to authorize a search and seizure.  The
    terms about which they are concerned are that the sculptures were to be produced
    to M. Perrault, that they could have no access to their property, and that
    M. Perrault could perform potentially destructive tests. They submit that
    by using the evidence-gathering order, the Attorney General of Canada was
    able to avoid the usual safeguards that attend the obtaining and execution
    of a search warrant.  Similarly, the nature of the order obtained in this
    case was such as to deprive the owners of the usual safeguards that are available
    in an evidence-gathering order.  They thus argue that the judge had no jurisdiction
    to make this particular evidence-gathering order.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    collectors submit that s. 18 does not grant jurisdiction to detain or impound
    property or to permit any form of physical interference with property. In
    my view, however, the plain wording of s. 18 contemplates production of things
    such as the plasters in this case for examination.  Section 18(2)(<i>a</i>)
    provides for an order for the examination under oath of a person and includes
    the power to order that person to bring “any record or thing in his possession
    or control”
    in order to produce them to the person conducting the examination.  Section
    18(2)(<i>b</i>) of the Act gives the court the power to order a person named
    in the order “to produce any record or thing in his possession or control” to
    a designated person.  Section 18(2)(<i>c</i>) provides that the order may
    designate a person before whom the examination under para. (2)(<i>a</i>)
    is to take place or to whom things mentioned in para. (2)(<i>b</i>) are to
    be produced.  The power to order production as an incident of the examination
    under para. (2)(<i>a</i>) is distinct from the power to order production
    under para. (2)(<i>b</i>).  There would be no need for para. (2)(<i>b</i>)
    if the production power depended upon an examination under para. (2)(<i>a</i>);
    para. (2)(<i>b</i>) would be wholly redundant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    collectors submit that they were deprived of the ability to object before
    being required to produce the plasters, the usual safeguard for an evidence-gathering
    order. As this court said in <i>Canada (Commissioner of Competition) v. Falconbridge
    Ltd.</i> (2003), 173 C.C.C. (3d) 466 at para. 19:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>There are a
    number of safeguards inherent in the procedure and explicitly provided in
    the legislation that protect the target of the order. First, as indicated,
    the authorities do not seize the material sought. <i>The person against whom
    the order is made must produce them. This gives the person an opportunity
    to challenge the validity and scope of the order before a court.</i> Second,
    the judge who made the order or any other judge may vary its terms and conditions
    pursuant to s. 18(6). Third, s. 18(7) provides that the person may refuse
    to produce a record or thing if producing the record or thing would disclose
    information that is protected by Canadian laws relating to privilege or non-disclosure
    of information.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is not unusual for an evidence-gathering order to be made against someone
    other than the owner of the record or things.  Paragraph 18(2)(<i>b</i>)
    expressly contemplates such a situation.  An order to produce requires persons
    to produce things in their “possession or control”, terms that are not synonymous
    with ownership.  Owners are dependent upon the persons to whom they have
    entrusted their records or things to either object to production or to notify
    them so that they may apply for standing and object to the production.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    it is difficult to understand how the collectors would have been in a better
    position if the Attorney General of Canada had applied for a search warrant,
    the procedure they say should have been followed.  The applications for both
    of these investigative aids are made <i>ex parte</i> and both a warrant and
    an order are served on the person in control of the things sought to be seized
    or produced, as the case may be.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    orders in this case were served on the MacLaren and the other custodians
    of the plasters.  The MacLaren had the opportunity to object to producing
    the plasters or could have notified the owners that the order had been made
    so that they could object to production.  I think that the application judge
    could have included a term requiring that the owners be served with the order,
    but his failure to do so was not a jurisdictional error.  The judge could
    reasonably take the view that the MacLaren would know who owned the plasters
    and would notify them accordingly.  If the Attorney General of Canada had
    proceeded by way of search warrant rather than order, the collectors would
    have been in no better position; they still would have depended upon the
    MacLaren to notify them of the warrant’s existence.</p>

    any event, the owners did eventually learn of the order.  I agree with the
    collectors that counsel for the Attorney General of Canada should have sent
    a copy of the order to counsel for the collectors when she was asked to do
    so.  The collectors were innocent third parties with proprietary interests
    in valuable works of art. They were entitled to a copy of the order upon
    request.  The possible intervention of the Regional Senior Judge should not
    have been necessary.  However, the collectors do not allege any prejudice
    flowed from the initial refusal of the Attorney General of Canada to provide
    them with a copy of the order. Thus, in this case, failure to immediately
    provide the collectors with a copy of the order does not invalidate it and
    is not a basis for setting aside the sending order. </p>

    conclude on this aspect of the appeal, the plasters fall within the meaning

    collectors further submit that there was no jurisdiction to make the impounding
    order, which was, in effect, a seizure. They argue that the authorities should
    have proceeded by way of search warrant.  In my view, this submission misconceives
    the nature of an evidence-gathering order.  There are important differences
    between an evidence-gathering order and a search warrant but they are similar
    in the sense that the person in possession of the things seized under the
    warrant, or produced under the order, loses control of those things.  The
    evidence-gathering order is less intrusive only in the sense that, rather
    than the authorities entering the premises and seizing the things in what
    can be a highly disruptive process, the person named in the order is given
    the opportunity to produce the things sought. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Section
    18(5) provides that the order may include “any terms or conditions that the
    judge considers desirable, including those relating to the protection of
    the interests of the person named therein and of third parties”.  This broad
    discretion at least gives the judge jurisdiction to include a term that the
    judge considers necessary to effect the evidence gathering. It seems to me
    that, in this case, the application judge had at least two ways to make the
    order effective.  He could have required that the MacLaren produce the plasters
    by physically moving them to a place under RCMP control.  Alternatively,
    he could, as here, have required that the MacLaren simply make the plasters
    available to Constable Ménard (or her designate) for examination by her expert
    and prohibited anyone, including the owners, from removing the plasters until
    the examination was complete.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    may be that the order is broader than was absolutely required.  There was
    probably no need to deprive the owners of access to their plasters “until
    a final decision is rendered concerning the disposal of those plasters”.  That
    term went beyond what was necessary to permit the examination.  On the other
    hand, the order expressly permitted persons to deal with the plasters if
    they obtained authorization from a judge.  It was open to the MacLaren or
    the owners to seek that authorization and the owners eventually did so in
    May 2005.  This defect was not sufficiently serious to require setting aside
    the sending order.</p>

    collectors also submit that the evidence-gathering provisions of the Act
    do not authorize the kind of destructive testing that was performed by M.
    Perrault.  They suggest that such testing would not even be permissible under
    a search warrant.  As to the latter point, I think the collectors are simply
    wrong.  Once things have been seized under a warrant, it is not uncommon
    that destructive testing takes place.  For example, holes will be cut in
    an article of clothing to allow for DNA testing of any biological residue
    and documents may be subjected to chemical fingerprinting processes that
    can result in permanent harm to the document.  As far as the risk of damage,
    the collectors were in no worse position because the Attorney General of
    Canada proceeded by way of an evidence-gathering order rather than a warrant.  Production
    of a record or thing contemplates that they will be examined and, depending
    on the nature of the thing produced, some testing performed.  It is within
    the power of the judge to attach suitable conditions to protect the things
    from destructive testing, but I cannot read s. 18 as precluding the possibility
    that the thing produced may be damaged.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the collectors’ real complaint is that the order did not contain
    sufficient terms to safeguard these valuable works of art.  I am not convinced
    that is so.  The order was quite specific.  First, it identified M. Perrault
    as the person to conduct the examination.  Whatever may be said about his
    qualifications as an expert in Rodin, he was said to be an expert in restoration
    of works of art.  Second, he was permitted only to “examine them (notably:
    take photos and measurements, take micro-samples, conduct micro-tests on
    the patina, examine the surfaces and markings)”.  The application judge could
    reasonably conclude that this kind of examination would safeguard the plasters
    while permitting the gathering of the necessary evidence.  A judge might
    include a similar term in any search warrant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the order also included the term authorizing the employees of the MacLaren “to
    handle the plasters so as to make them accessible to Mr. Perrault and to
    repack them once the examination is completed”.  This too provided a safeguard
    to protect the plasters.  If the MacLaren was concerned that these valuable
    works of art in its control were going to be damaged by the examination,
    they could have applied to the court to vary the order before producing them.  I
    realize that there is a dispute as to whether the plasters were damaged and
    that the application judge made a finding that there was some damage, but
    it hardly seems likely that there would have been less damage if the examination
    had been conducted pursuant to a search warrant rather than an evidence-gathering
    order.  In my view, the application judge did not exceed his jurisdiction
    by allowing for the kind of examination that took place in this case.</p>

    French expert Gilles Perrault so that he can examine them”.  M. Perrault
    is then to turn over the fruits of his examination to Constable Ménard or
    her designate and to destroy all of his working documents in the presence
    of the constable or her designate.  The actual wording of that term is as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span

      Police (Claudine Ménard .... or another person designated by her) under

    my view, the s. 18 order should not have directed the custodians to make
    the plasters available to M. Perrault for examination.  Section 18 requires
    that the records or things be produced to the designated person.  I have
    concluded, however, that directing that the plasters be turned over to M.
    Perrault is not a substantive defect.  I have reached this conclusion notwithstanding
    a body of authority that suggests that foreign officials should have only
    minimal involvement in the execution of a search warrant issued under the
    Act.  See <i>United States of America v. Schneider</i>, [2002] B.C.J. No.
    1561 (S.C.) at paras. 47 to 51; <i>Germany (Federal Republic) v. Ebke</i> (2001),
    158 C.C.C. (3d) 253 (N.W.T.S.C.) at paras. 83-91; <i>United States of America

    should not be taken as questioning the correctness of those authorities.  The
    fact remains that s. 18 is worded differently than the search warrant provision
    and both it and the Treaty involved in this case (namely, <i>Treaty between
    the Government of Canada and the Government of the Republic of France on
    Mutual Assistance in Penal Matters</i>, 15 December, 1989, Can. T.S. 1991
    No. 34)<i> </i>specifically contemplate the involvement of foreign authorities
    in the gathering of evidence.  Article 5(3) of the Treaty provides that authorities
    of the requesting state can be present at any hearing of witnesses and can
    conduct examinations of the witnesses.  This is consistent with other parts
    of s. 18, which contemplate that the examinations may be conducted before
    a judge of a foreign court.  See for example s. 18(8)(<i>a</i>), which provides
    that if the person designated under s. (2)(<i>c</i>) is a judge of a foreign
    court, the judge may make immediate rulings.  The examination conducted by
    M. Perrault was not an evidentiary hearing in that sense and therefore is
    not expressly within the terms of the Treaty.  However, given these provisions
    of the Treaty and the Act, having an agent<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[4]</span></a> of
    the requesting state present at and conducting the kind of examination that
    was carried out by M. Perrault is not inconsistent with the Treaty or the
    Act, so long as suitable safeguards are put in place to ensure that the evidence
    is not sent to the requesting state without judicial authorization.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    were suitable safeguards in this case. Under the order, M. Perrault was required
    to turn over all of the evidence to Constable Ménard (or her designate) and
    to destroy his working papers in her presence.  The evidence also shows that
    Constable Bédard, apparently Constable Ménard’s designate, was present throughout
    the examination by M. Perrault.  Thus, an attempt was made to comply with
    the Act by requiring that all evidence gathered by the expert be retained
    by the Canadian designee until the sending order was made. </p>

    make one last comment about the procedure followed in this case.  After the
    inspection orders had been executed, the collectors moved to set aside the
    terms of the orders impounding the collection.  At the request of counsel
    for the Attorney General of Canada, the collectors agreed to make their submissions
    concerning the impounding order at the pending sending order hearing.  As
    it turned out, for reasons that are not now material, the hearing was delayed
    and the collectors’
    application became much broader than simply setting aside one term of the
    orders.  In my view, in the future, where persons, like the collectors, with
    standing to challenge s. 18 orders seek to set aside the orders or vary their
    terms under s. 18(6), they should move promptly.  I say this especially because,
    as I explain below, they will rarely be entitled to compensation for the
    costs of complying with the orders.</p>

    ensure that all terms and conditions of this Order have been fully satisfied”.  I
    have considerable doubt that this was a proper order.  Section 21 of the
    Act provides: “No record or thing that has been ordered under section 20
    to be sent to the state … shall be so sent until the Minister is satisfied
    that the state or entity has agreed to comply with any terms or conditions
    imposed in respect of the sending abroad of the record or thing.”  In <i>Russian
    Federation v. Pokidyshev</i> (1999), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (Ont. C.A.) at para.
    40, Doherty J.A. held that “a judge under s. 20 is not concerned with the
    advisability of assisting the foreign jurisdiction or whether the foreign
    jurisdiction will comply with any order the judge might make. Those matters
    must be addressed by the Minister of Justice.”  Accordingly, it seems to
    me that the application judge, having made his sending order, should have
    left it to the Minister to ensure compliance with its terms. </p>

    objectives of the Act are paramount.  The Act fulfills Canada’s international
    obligations to co-operate in the investigation of international crime and
    to provide legal assistance in criminal matters to other states.  Second,
    by offering assistance to other states, Canada ensures that those states
    will in turn provide it with assistance when necessary to investigate crimes

    addition, since this is criminal legislation, it should be interpreted in
    a manner that is consistent with the principles that govern the interpretation
    and application of criminal legislation.  In considering a costs order, the
    paramount principle to bear in mind is that in criminal matters costs are
    ordinarily not recoverable from, nor paid to, the Crown, the accused or third
    parties, even where there is a statutory basis for awarding costs.  For reasons
    that I will set out below, I consider this principle applicable to the kind
    of compensation terms imposed by the application judge in this case.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    as Fish J.A. said in <i>United States of America v. Ross</i> (1995), 100
    C.C.C. (3d) 320 (Que. C.A.) at 324:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Courts must

line-height:normal'>[59]<span

    indemnification and storage costs conditions represent an attempt to compensate
    the collectors and the MacLaren for damage caused to their property and costs
    they incurred in the execution of the evidence-gathering order.  Absent an
    express statutory basis, as for example can be found in the victim compensation
    and restitution provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, a court dealing with
    criminal matters is not ordinarily concerned with compensation for losses
    incurred in the course of criminal proceedings.  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;

title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[6]</span></a>  The most recent consideration
    of the issue is in <i>Canada (Attorney General) v. Pacific International
    Securities Inc.</i> (2006), 209 C.C.C. (3d) 390 (B.C.C.A.), which also concerned

    closest analogy for making a compensation order in criminal cases can be
    found in the statutory and common law power to award costs of proceedings
    against the Crown.  The cases that have considered this question offer a
    helpful benchmark against which to gauge the propriety of the kind of compensation
    orders made in this case.  I will therefore briefly discuss those cases,
    set out what I say should be the general principles animating orders compensating
    persons required to comply with orders made in criminal cases, and then turn
    to the particular context of the <i>Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters

    of the statutory power of sentencing courts to make compensation orders against
    offenders in favour of victims of crime has not affected this principle as
    it applies to other participants in the criminal justice system.  For example,
    in <i>R. v. Veri</i> (2000), 71 C.R.R. (2d) 196 at para. 7, this court held
    that costs will be awarded under s. 809 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>in summary
    conviction proceedings only where there is “oppressive or improper conduct” on
    the part of the Crown or other special circumstances exist.  Also see <i>R.
    v. “Glenshiel” (The)</i> (2001), 157 C.C.C. (3d) 335 (B.C.C.A.).  </p>

    in <i>R. v. Garcia</i> (2005), 194 C.C.C. (3d) 361 at para. 11, this court
    held that while a summary conviction appeal court has a “broad discretion” to
    award costs under s. 826 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, the award of costs
    is the exception not the rule.  Speaking for the court at para. 13, Doherty
    J.A. held that in addition to cases of misconduct by the Crown, costs will
    be awarded against the Crown where “other exceptional circumstances exist
    such that fairness requires that the individual litigant not carry the financial
    burden flowing from his or her involvement in the litigation”.  The mere
    fact that the appeal “raises a legal issue of general importance whose resolution
    will affect other cases cannot suffice to make the appeal an
    ‘exceptional’ case warranting a costs order against the Crown” (para. 22).
    He also referred with approval at para. 12 to the “strong policy reasons” against
    granting costs for or against the Crown set out in <i>R. v. Robinson</i> (1999),
    142 C.C.C. (3d) 303 (Alta. C.A.) at 315-16.  In <i>Robinson</i> at para.
    29, McFadyen&nbsp;J.A. described those policy reasons in these terms:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The reasons
    for limiting costs are that the Crown is not an ordinary litigant, does not
    win or lose criminal cases, and conducts prosecutions and makes decisions
    respecting prosecutions in the public interest. In the absence of proof of
    misconduct, an award of costs against the Crown would be a harsh penalty
    for a Crown officer carrying out such public duties.</p>

      J. succinctly summarized the general rule and placed it in the broader
      context of compensation generally:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Traditionally,
    the primary focus of criminal proceedings has been determination of the guilt
    or innocence of accused persons and in the event of conviction, the penalty.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Compensation
    for losses incurred in the course of those proceedings is ordinarily left
    to civil proceedings and has been limited on public policy grounds.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;For
    example, an innocent person who has incurred expenses to defend him or herself
    cannot recover those costs in the criminal proceedings and may have a civil
    remedy only in the event of malicious prosecution.&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither jurors
    nor witnesses are fully compensated for income lost because of attendances
    at court. The public interest in unconstrained determination of guilt or
    innocence sometimes results in losses for persons not at fault.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The
    fact that the Applicant has suffered losses for which she is not responsible

    general rule that witnesses and other innocent third parties (like the innocent
    accused) are not compensated for losses and expenses occasioned by the criminal
    process exists despite the fact that these costs can be onerous. A witness,
    for example, may be jailed as a material witness.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span

    have not attempted to exhaustively define the scope of exceptional circumstances,
    outside Crown misconduct, that will justify an award of costs in a criminal
    matter.  The language used in the cases, however, captures the unusual nature
    of such an order.  For example, in <i>R. v. M. (C.A.) </i>(1996), 105 C.C.C.
    (3d) 327 (S.C.C.) at 377, the court referred to the “prevailing convention
    of criminal practice” that, absent oppressive or improper conduct by the
    Crown, a criminal defendant is generally not entitled to costs unless the
    circumstances are “remarkable”.  To a similar effect is <i>R. v. Leblanc</i>,
    [1999] N.S.J. No. 179 (C.A.) at para. 15.  In <i>R. v. King</i> (1986), 26
    C.C.C. (3d) 349 (B.C.C.A.) at 351, the court suggested that while the classes
    of cases for awarding costs beyond improper Crown conduct or a test case
    were not closed there would have to be “some special category”.  In <i>R.
    v. Curragh Inc.</i> (1997), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.) at para. 13 the
    circumstances were described as “unique” and justified an order for costs </p>

    in <i>R. v. Ciarniello</i>, [2006] O.J. No. 3444, this court considered the
    circumstances in which a costs order may be made against the Crown as a remedy
    under s. 24(1) in favour of an innocent third party.  Speaking for the court,
    Sharpe J.A. noted that absent a <i>Charter</i> violation, the circumstances
    in which a costs order will be made against the Crown are narrow.  As he
    said at para. 32:  “Routine costs awards in favour of the winning party are
    a feature of civil, not criminal proceedings.”  However, as he said at para.
    35, “[b]ecause of their constitutional status, <i>Charter</i> rights have
    a higher claim to judicial protection than non-<i>Charter</i> rights and
    s. 24(1) entitles the victim of a <i>Charter</i> breach to an appropriate

    my view, a principle that will assist in identifying the exceptional circumstances
    where costs or any kind of compensation may be awarded (outside the broad
    remedial powers given a court by s. 24(1) of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights
    and Freedoms</i>) lies in the court’s inherent power to protect against abuse
    of process.  This principle is illustrated by reference to the generally
    accepted statement of when costs are payable in criminal matters, absent
    express statutory authority, by L'Heureux-Dubé J.A. in <i>Attorney-General
    of Quebec et al. v. Cronier</i> (1981), 63 C.C.C. (2d) 437 (Que. C.A.) at

    18(5) is admittedly broadly worded to allow a judge to include any terms
    or conditions that the judge considers desirable.  The section does not,
    however, give an explicit grant of power to order that one party indemnify
    another for costs of compliance, except in the narrow circumstances set out
    in s. 18(10).  That subsection recognizes that a person required to comply
    with an evidence-gathering order is similarly situated to a witness in a
    criminal proceeding and is therefore entitled to similar compensation.  It
    provides as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A person named
    in an order made under subsection (1) is entitled to be paid the travel and
    living expenses to which the person would be entitled if the person were

    there is no support in the Treaty for this kind of compensation order.   The
    first article of the Treaty indicates that it is related to mutual assistance
    in the investigation and prosecution of “penal offences”.  Article 10 deals
    with fees and expenses of witnesses and experts and appears to contemplate
    that those fees and expenses are paid by the requesting state.  However,
    the expenses are limited to an allowance, including an allowance for “subsistence” and
    travelling expenses.  Under article 16, subject to negotiation between Canada
    and France with respect to “extraordinary expenses”, any other expenses are
    borne by the requested state, in this case, Canada.</p>

    said, in my view, if compliance with the order would be oppressive, the judge
    considering an application under s. 18 would be justified in special cases
    in putting the requesting state to the choice of paying all or some of the
    costs or foregoing the order.  A term requiring compensation could be imposed
    either under s. 18(5) or as an incident of the power to protect the court’s
    process from abuse. Or, as it was put by Mr. Schwartz, counsel for the Intervener,
    if compliance would be unreasonable, the innocent party may be entitled to
    compensation.  He suggested that compliance would be unreasonable if the
    costs of compliance would present an undue hardship.  I agree that this is
    an apt description of one circumstance where a compensation order may be
    appropriate.</p>

    if compliance with an evidence-gathering order would entail undue financial
    hardship to the innocent object of the order so that it could be said that
    requiring the person to comply would be contrary to the interests of justice,
    the application judge could make an exceptional order relating to payment

    considering the types of terms or conditions that may properly be attached
    to a sending order, it is necessary to bear in mind the context in which
    the order is made.  Subject to the question of refusals, which are dealt
    with in ss. 20(3) and (4), a sending order is made where the evidence-gathering
    order has been executed and a judge has decided that it is appropriate to
    send the material to the requesting state.  In considering what, if any,
    terms or conditions to impose, the judge, in my view, is principally concerned
    with the treatment of the materials to be sent.  This is borne out by two
    of the particularized bases for terms or conditions specified in s. 20(2),
    namely terms or conditions (a) necessary to give effect to the request from
    the foreign state and (b) respecting the preservation and return to Canada
    of the things to be sent.  The third particularized basis for imposing terms
    or conditions, para. (<i>c</i>), is somewhat broader and would seem to involve
    not only third party interests in the treatment of the things sent, but also
    the use of those materials.  Two of the terms imposed by the application
    judge in this case fall within the scope of these three particularized bases,
    namely, (a) a condition that the Minister obtain assurances from France that
    a copy of the final report by M.&nbsp;Perrault would be provided to the MacLaren
    and the collectors, and (b) a condition that the use of the report be limited
    to the purpose for which it was requested, namely the ongoing criminal investigation.</p>

    I would not want to foreclose the exceptional possibility that a judge, in
    considering a sending order application under s. 20 of the Act, could impose
    a condition or term respecting payment of costs of compliance to remedy an
    abuse of process.  This court has held that in considering whether to make
    a sending order under s. 15, a judge may take into account the conduct of
    the Crown in gathering the evidence.<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="">[12]</a></span>  I
    can see no principled basis for a different interpretation of s. 20. Further,
    in <i>Pokidyshev</i> at para. 39, Doherty J.A. held that a judge at a s.
    20 hearing may consider evidence that “is relevant to the basis upon which
    the gathering order was obtained”.  I tend to think, however, that properly
    speaking such an order should be made as a variation to the original evidence-gathering
    order pursuant to s. 18(6).  </p>

line-height:normal'>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the collectors offered no evidence to show that the costs of compliance
    with the order entailed exceptional financial hardship that would have justified
    the storage costs term as part of the evidence-gathering order, let alone
    required such a term as a condition for sending the material to France.  The
    manner in which the materials were gathered was not abusive of the Canadian
    court process or so oppressive that the application judge was justified in
    imposing a term relating to payment of costs of compliance.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the indemnification term, in my view, similar considerations apply.  The
    collectors offered no evidence to show that the execution of the order envisaged
    the kind of exceptional loss to the collectors that would trigger the court’s
    inherent jurisdiction to protect its processes from abuse.</p>

    collectors argue that mutual legal assistance is not an ordinary criminal
    proceeding and that it is open to the courts to adopt a different approach
    to costs than is the case with criminal proceedings.  Admittedly, mutual
    legal assistance is different from domestic prosecution in the sense that
    the immediate beneficiary of the fruits of the investigation is a foreign
    state rather than the Canadian public.  But, like domestic criminal proceedings,
    mutual legal assistance proceedings are taken in the public interest.  Mutual
    legal assistance provides a means by which members of the Canadian public
    can have their rights vindicated when it happens that evidence needed for
    a domestic prosecution exists in another jurisdiction.  It is part of the
    fabric of our system of criminal law; it is not a civil proceeding.  As was
    said by the majority of the court in <i>R. v. Malmo-Levine; R. v. Caine</i> (2003),
    179 C.C.C. (3d) 417 (S.C.C.) at para. 174:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In any system
    of criminal law there will be prosecutions that turn out to be unfounded,
    publicity that is unfairly adverse, costs associated with a successful defence,
    lingering and perhaps unfair consequences attached to a conviction for a
    relatively minor offence by other jurisdictions, and so on. These effects
    are serious but they are part of the social and individual costs of having
    a criminal justice system. Whenever Parliament exercises its criminal law
    power, such costs will arise.</p>

    not be justified under s. 20(2).  Dealing specifically with s. 20(2)(<i>c</i>),
    he noted that this paragraph uses the phrase
    “interests of third parties” and that the party producing the records, the
    security dealer, was not a third party.  He also held more broadly at para.
    18 that the use of the phrase “who produced any record of thing” in s. 20(2)
    signalled that “Parliament intended this discretion to be exercised in respect
    of matters arising during and after the transmission to the foreign state
    of evidence already obtained pursuant to s. 18(1).”  Smith J.A. also invoked
    the <i>ejusdem generis</i> principle of interpretation to support this conclusion
    holding that “the apparently general discretion in s. 20(2) to include any
    term or condition considered desirable by the judge is limited by the enumerated
    examples to matters of the same nature, that is, to matters arising during

    Smith then considered whether the order could have been made under s.&nbsp;18.  In
    this respect, his opinion does not represent the view of the majority.  He
    held that, unlike s. 20(2), s. 18(5) confers a broad discretion on the judge
    to impose a condition for reimbursement of expenses.  He rejected the argument
    that the specific reference in s. 18(10) to entitlement to travel and living
    expenses limited the discretion to order reimbursement of other expenses
    in s. 18(5).  He held that the phrase in s. 18(5) permitting the judge to
    include terms or conditions that the judge considers desirable “including
    those relating to the protection of the interests of the person named therein
    and of third parties” was broad enough to include a term to protect the financial
    interests of the person named in the order.  Accordingly, Smith J.A. would
    have dismissed the appeal except to order that the term requiring reimbursement
    of expenses be deemed to have been a variation of the terms or conditions

    J.A., writing for herself and Saunders J.A., disagreed with Smith J.A. concerning
    the interpretation of s. 18.  She held that the Act is a complete code with
    respect to expenses and that s. 18(5) could not be read to provide a broad
    power to include an order for reimbursement of compliance expenses.  At para.
    59, she reasoned:  “Given that subsection (10) deals with expenses, subsection

    J.A. particularly relied upon <i>Gladstone v. Canada (Attorney General)</i>,

    R.S.C. 1985, c. F-14 concerning return of proceeds of sale of fish seized
    under that act.  In <i>Gladstone</i>, the court held that the Act created
    a complete code dealing with the disposition and return of seized property.  Ryan
    J.A. similarly held that s. 18 creates a complete code relating to payment
    of expenses of compliance and that the only provision for payment of expenses
    to witnesses is in s. 18(10).  She also relied upon the longstanding practice
    that neither costs nor expenses are recoverable in criminal proceedings.

    decided in a particular context where the statute expressly contemplated
    payment of interest on amounts owed to the Crown, but made no similar provision
    in respect of amounts owed by the Crown.  There was as well no general provision,

    under s. 20(2)(<i>c</i>) in accordance with Smith J.A.’s reasons.  They dispute,
    however, the reasoning that the matters enumerated in paras. (<i>a</i>) to
    (<i>c</i>) were intended as an exhaustive list of what a judge may order
    under s. 20(2).  In my view, this is not a correct interpretation of the
    reasons of Smith J.A.  He did not hold that paras. (<i>a</i>) to (<i>c</i>)
    constitute an exhaustive list; such an interpretation would be inconsistent
    with the wording of s. 20(2).  Rather, he held that the inclusion of these
    examples, as well as the wording of the whole subsection, indicates that
    the terms or conditions must relate to matters arising during and after transmission
    to the foreign state.  I agree with that interpretation subject to the caveat,
    for the reasons expressed above, that the sending judge also has the jurisdiction

    of this status the judge could “see no reason why their costs of these particular

    as a matter of course in proceedings under the Act whenever innocent third
    parties are involved.  In my view, that is not the correct approach. The
    persons named in s. 18 orders are frequently innocent third parties such
    as financial institutions, other record keepers, or witnesses.  To award
    costs in proceedings under the Act, virtually as a matter of course, would

      Inc</i>., the trial judge had improperly contacted senior officials in
      the prosecutor’s office in an attempt to have a prosecuting counsel removed.  The
      trial judge refused to recuse himself and then later ordered a stay of
      proceedings.  The Supreme Court of Canada held that the judge’s actions
      gave rise to an apprehension of bias, that he should have recused himself
      and had no jurisdiction to stay the proceedings and ordered a new trial.  Speaking
      for the majority, La Forest and Cory JJ. noted at para. 13 that while the
      accused had suffered considerable financial burden of legal costs: “Ordinarily
      this is something which must be accepted by those charged with criminal
      offences.”  The Supreme Court held that the delays and much of the legal
      costs incurred “arise from systemic problems that were beyond the control
      of the appellants” and to a large extent by the improper conduct of the
      trial judge.  Accordingly, in those
    “unique circumstances” the accused should be able to recover their reasonable
    legal costs.</p>
