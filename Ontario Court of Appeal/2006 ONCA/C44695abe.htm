  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants seek to set aside the summary judgment granted
    by Wilton-Siegel J. dismissing their action and allowing the respondent’s
    counterclaim on a promissory note.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties were shareholders in Drums Inc.  When the respondent resigned as an employee
    of the company he was obliged, under an Employee Shareholder Agreement, to sell
    his shares to the others at fair market value (“FMV”).  He did not so immediately, but did so on
    June 30, 2000 – on the eve of and in the heat of the closing of another
    transaction in which the shares of Drums Inc. were being sold to a third party.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the Share Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) reflecting the
    respondent’s sale to the appellants, the parties agreed the FMV of his shares
    was U.S.$24,170.  At the same time as
    the SPS was executed, the parties also executed a Release and a Confidentiality
    Agreement.  The respondent was paid the
    U.S.$24,170 plus an additional $75,000, and he received as well a $50,000
    promissory note.  The promissory note is
    the subject of the counterclaim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the action, the appellants attack the agreements on grounds
    of unconscionability, economic duress and oppression.  They assert in the counterclaim that the equities entitle them to
    decline payment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the respondent’s motion for summary judgment was based
    on the ground that the Release was a bar to the action, the motions judge did
    not decide it on that basis.  Instead,
    he analysed whether, on the record, there was a basis for the claims of duress,
    unconscionability and oppression.  He
    concluded there was not – principally because he inferred that there was no
    evidence to support the appellants’ belief that the FMV of the shares was
    $24,170.  As this fact is a crucial
    first premise in establishing the appellant’s claims, they therefore failed, in
    his view.  He also examined the evidence
    to determine whether the various criteria for economic duress were met, and
    concluded they were not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respectfully, he erred in law in taking this approach on the
    motion for summary judgment.  Apart from
    the fact that this was not the basis upon which the motion was put to him and
    upon which the record had been created, the motion judge was wrong in saying
    there was no evidence to support the FMV of $24,170.  There was, in the SPA.  He
    simply inferred from the other evidence that there might be another value and
    refused to accept the $24,170 value.  On
    a motion for summary judgment, however, it is not open for the judge to decide
    which competing inferences should be preferred from primary facts in evidence:
    see <i>Riviera Farms Ltd. v. Paegus Financial Corp.</i>  (1988), 29 CPC (2d) 217 (Ont. H.C.); <i>Folland
    v. Reardon</i> (2005), 74 O.R. (3d) 688 (C.A.).  In our view, the motion judge made this error throughout in his
    analysis of the various claims. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are genuine issues of material fact that require a trial
    for determination in this case.  These
    include, but are not limited to (a) whether the transaction is to be considered
    as a whole or as a separate sale and release transaction, and (b) whether the
    respondent received an inordinately high consideration for the sale of his
    shares leading to inferences supporting unconscionability and duress.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In these circumstances there must be a trial.  The appeal is therefore allowed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants are entitled to their costs of the motion,
    fixed at $9,000 all-inclusive, and of the appeal, fixed at $5,000
    all-inclusive.</p>
