      parties were married on August 12, 1973, and separated in December of 1997.  They
      have four children, all of whom have reached the age of majority.  The
      marriage ended by the divorce judgment of Sachs&nbsp;J. on May 2, 2004,
      pursuant to a petition for divorce.  Corollary relief proceedings were
      commenced by a statement of claim in a separate court action.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

      almost six years of difficult litigation, settlement negotiations between
      the parties resulted in a separation agreement dated November 21,&nbsp;2003
      (the
    “Agreement”).  The Agreement contemplated a number of corporate, trust and
    real estate transactions that were to be affected simultaneously on closing.  Among
    other things, the Agreement provides that: Mr. Linett will transfer to Ms.
    Linett his interest in the matrimonial home and a Florida condominium in
    exchange for consideration from Ms. Linett; Ms. Linett will pay Mr. Linett
    an equalization payment; $250,000 will be maintained in the Linett Family
    Trust for the benefit of the adult children; and $600,000 will be distributed
    from the trust in accordance with agreed terms.  Although each party is entitled
    to receive $300,000 from the trust, the Agreement provides that Ms. Linett’s
    share is to be transferred to Mr. Linett in partial satisfaction of the money
    that she owes him.  </span></p>

      March of 2005, Mr. Linett brought a motion to compel Ms. Linett to comply
      with the terms of the Agreement.  Ms. Linett brought a cross-motion in
      which she requested relief in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.  She
      did not, and has not, disputed the validity of the Agreement.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

      order dated June 15, 2005, Harvison Young J., the motion judge, granted
      Mr.&nbsp;Linett’s motion.  The motion judge found that neither party was
      prepared to close in the spring of 2004 but that “since the summer of 2004,
      Ms. Linett has not cooperated in the closings pursuant to the Agreement”.  She
      further found that Ms. Linett had had second thoughts about the Agreement,
      had taken no steps to set aside the Agreement and that nothing had been
      put before the court to suggest that the Agreement might not be valid.</span></p>

      motion judge ordered Ms. Linett to pay the amounts owing under the Agreement
      within four weeks of the date of the order.  Those sums were to be held
      in escrow pending the completion of the related transactions.  The order
      also requires Ms.&nbsp;Linett to: sign any documentation necessary to facilitate
      the closing, transfers and transactions set out in the Agreement; pay interest
      on the full amount owing from July&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2004; repay $12,000 that
      she removed from the trust; attend to accept the Ghet; and, facilitate
      Mr.&nbsp;Linett’s attendance at the matrimonial home and condominium to
      review their contents.  In a cost order dated September 23, 2005, Ms. Linett
      was ordered to pay Mr. Linett costs of the motion.   </span></p>

      Linett raises two issues on appeal.  First, she says that the motion judge
      lacked jurisdiction to hear Mr. Linett’s motion because enforcement of
      a separation agreement can be done only by way of application, not motion.  As
      the orders were made without jurisdiction, she contends they are nullities
      and the parties’ consent could not have conferred jurisdiction. Second,
      she argues that as the Agreement was silent as to interest, the motion
      judge erred in awarding interest to Mr.&nbsp;Linett.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>JURISDICTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The <i>Family
        Law Rules</i> have applied to family law cases in the Toronto area, including
        cases involving the enforcement of separation agreements, since July
        1, 2004.  See rule 1(2)(b) of the <i>Family Law Rules</i>, O. Reg. 114/99.  There
        is no disagreement between the parties that the Superior Court of Justice
        has the jurisdiction to enforce the Agreement.  However, based largely
        on rules 8, 14 and 15 of the <i>Family Law Rules</i>, the appellant says
        that the court below had no jurisdiction to enforce the Agreement except
        by way of application.    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Rule
      8(1) provides that to start a case, a person must file an application.  Rule
      8(1) reads as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>To start a case, a person shall
      file an application (Form 8, 8A, 8B, 8C, 8D or 8D.1) and, if required,
      a summary of court cases (Form 8E).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant contends that the respondent had to start a case to enforce the
      Agreement as the Agreement put to an end the action commenced for corollary
      relief.  Thus, she says, the respondent had to bring an application in
      order to enforce the Agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      disagree.  The action in which corollary relief was pursued has not been
      dismissed or otherwise ended.  As the action continues and the court file
      remains open, the respondent was entitled to take steps within that action
      and to rely on the materials in the existing court file including orders,
      previous affidavits and the history of proceedings.  Rule 8(1) does not
      require the respondent to begin afresh, by way of application.  </span>It
      would be time consuming, costly and inefficient to require the respondent
      to start a new proceeding for the enforcement of the Agreement when there
      is an existing action in respect of the same subject matter.<span lang=EN-US>     </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Next,
      the appellant says that Rule 15(0.1) of the <i>Family Law Rules</i> provides
      that a party seeking to vary a support provision in an agreement may do
      so by way of motion but that all other matters regarding the interpretation
      or enforcement of a domestic contract must be commenced by application.  The
      appellant points to rule 14(1) saying that it limits motions to the three
      matters listed therein.    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Rules
      14(1) and 15(0.1) read as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>14.(1) A person
      who wants any of the following may make a motion:</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>1.   A temporary order for a claim made in
    an application.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>2.   Directions on how to carry on the case.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>3.   A change in a temporary order.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>15(0.1) This rules applies,</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span

      35 of the <i>Family Law Act</i>;</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span lang=EN-US>(b) to motions to change a
      final order, except a final order in a child protection case that is reviewable
      under section 64 of the <i>Child and Family Services Act</i>.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      agree that rule 15(0.1) contemplates that changes to an agreement for support
      may be brought by way of motion and that the respondent, through his motion,
      sought not to vary the Agreement but to enforce it.  I do not agree, however,
      that rule 14(1) or some combination of rules 14(1) and 15(0.1) is intended
      to be exhaustive of the matters that can be brought by way of motion.  By
      their wording, both rule 14(1) and rule 15(0.1) simply list matters that
      can be brought by way of motion.  They do not purport to suggest that no
      other matters relating to separation agreements can be brought by way of
      motion.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>I
      am unable to locate any provision in the <i>Family Law Rules </i>that addresses
      proceedings for the enforcement of separation agreements.  Consequently,
      in accordance with rule 1(7) of the <i>Family Law Rules</i>,<i> </i>the
      court may decide the practice by reference to the <i>Courts of Justice
      Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43<i> </i>or the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>,
      R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194.  Rule 1(7) reads as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>1(7)  If these rules do not cover
      a matter adequately, the court may give directions, and the practice shall
      be decided by analogy to these rules, by reference to the <i>Courts of
      Justice Act</i>, and the Act governing the case and, if the court considers
      appropriate, by reference to the Rules of Civil Procedure.      </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
      courts have </span>relied on rule&nbsp;49.09 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> to
      enforce settlement or separation agreements, matters generally brought
      by way of motion.  For example, in <i>Bogue v. Bogue</i> (1999), 46 O.R.
      (3d) 1, this court upheld the decision of a motion judge in which he granted
      judgment in a matrimonial action in accordance with the terms of settlement
      that he found the parties had agreed upon.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, had I concluded that the respondent was in error in bringing the
    proceeding by way of motion, I would not have interfered with the order below.  Rule
    1(8) of the <i>Family Law Rules</i> provides that where the Rules have not
    been followed properly, the court may deal with that failure by making any
    order it considers necessary for a just determination of the matter.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>1(8)     The court
      may deal with a failure to follow these rules, or a failure to obey an
      order in the case or a related case, by making any order that it considers
      necessary for a just determination of the matter, on any conditions that
      the court considers appropriate, including,</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a)       an order for costs;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b)       an order dismissing a claim made
    by a party who has wilfully failed to follow the rules or obey the order.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the wording of rule 1(8) makes it clear that a failure to comply
    with the <i>Family Law Rules</i> is an irregularity and does not render a
    proceeding or step or order taken in a proceeding, a nullity.  As an irregularity,
    the court may deal with the failure by making any order it considers necessary.  In
    the circumstances, I do not consider an order to be necessary.  By bringing
    a cross-motion for the enforcement of the Agreement and responding to Mr.&nbsp;Linett’s
    motion, Ms. Linett consented to the matter proceeding by way of motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    a related argument, the appellant also claims that by virtue of proceeding
    by way of motion (as opposed to application) she was denied the right to
    effectively challenge the respondent’s assertion that it was she who was
    responsible for the delay in completing the Agreement.  Assuming that the
    appellant is correct in her assertion that an application affords a party
    greater procedural rights than does a motion, I would not give effect to
    this ground of appeal.  The appellant brought a cross-motion in which she
    sought the same type of relief, namely, enforcement of the Agreement.  The
    appellant never sought to cross-examine the respondent on his affidavit.  She
    did not ask to be allowed to lead oral evidence nor did she request that
    the motion judge direct the trial of an issue.  In the circumstances, she
    cannot now claim prejudice by virtue of not having been afforded such rights.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>INTEREST</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant contends that because the Agreement was silent on the matter
      of interest, it was “inappropriate” for the motion judge to award interest.  She
      relies on <i>Bell v. Bell </i>(1998) Carswell BC 2195 (S.C.) as support
      for this position.  In <i>Bell v. Bell</i>, the application judge declined
      to award interest, saying at para. 41 that it was inappropriate because
      there was no provision in the minutes of settlement for the respondent
      to receive interest on his cash portion of the settlement.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      see no error in the motion judge’s order in respect of interest.  She had
      the power to award interest pursuant to s. 128 of the <i>Courts of Justice
      Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C. 43.    In addition to the fact that <i>Bell
      v. Bell </i>is not binding on the courts of this province, there are two
      distinctions that render the reasoning in that case inapplicable to the
      case at bar.  First, the application judge in <i>Bell v. Bell</i> made
      no reference to statutory authority.  Here, as previously mentioned, the
      motion judge’s authority to award interest flows from provincial legislation.  Second,
      the circumstances of this case are very different from those in <i>Bell
      v. Bell</i>.  In the latter case, the decision not to award interest was
      made in the context of an application to decide a number of contentious
      items that remained unresolved by the parties.  In the case at bar, there
      were no unresolved matters.  The closing date under the terms of the Agreement
      had come and gone.  The motion judge found that the delay in transfer of
      assets was attributable to the appellant.  The motion judge awarded interest
      as a means of addressing Mr. Linett’s claims regarding the cost of the
      delays.  Ms. Linett had enjoyed the benefit of the Agreement in that she
      had sole and exclusive use of the matrimonial home and the Florida condominium
      and she alone reaped the benefit of the significant increase in value of
