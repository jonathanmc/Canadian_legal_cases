  <p class=MsoBodyText>On appeal from the order of Justice James M. Spence of
    the Superior Court of Justice dated December 13, 2005, with reasons reported

    appellants appeal the order of Spence J. dated December 13, 2005, granting
    summary judgment to the respondent financial institutions and dismissing
    the appellants’ claims as against the financial institutions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, we would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellants bought mutual funds based on the advice of their financial advisors.  They
      obtained loans from the various respondent financial institutions and used
      the proceeds of the loans to purchase the mutual funds.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      order to obtain the loans, with the assistance of their financial advisors
      the appellants completed loan applications.  The advisors then submitted
      the loan applications to the various financial institutions for consideration.  When
      a financial institution accepted an application, it would authorize the
      loan and advance the funds to the financial advisor.  The financial advisor
      would then invest the borrowed money in mutual funds in accordance with
      the instructions of the client.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      loans all had margin requirements.  </span>The margin call feature is a
      term of the loan which provides that if the value of the investment made
      with the loan falls below a certain prescribed percentage of the amount
      of the loan (the “margin”), the borrower may be called upon to pay down
      the loan in an amount sufficient to bring the loan back “into margin”,
      that is, to a level at which the outstanding amount of the loan does not
      exceed the margin.&nbsp; If the borrower fails to meet the margin call
      from the lender, the lender may call the loan.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the present action, the appellants seek compensation from the financial advisors,
    investment dealers alleged to have been involved in the transactions, and
    the respondent financial institutions.  The appellants allege they have suffered
    damage because the investments failed to perform as promised and, when that
    occurred, they faced margin calls that resulted in losses or debts they say
    they would not have incurred had they not borrowed the funds and invested
    them in mutual funds.  While the appellants acknowledge that they obtained
    their loans and purchased the mutual fund investments relying solely on the
    advice and recommendations of their financial advisors, they contend that
    the respondent financial institutions owed them a duty to ensure that they
    had been advised of, and understood, the margin mechanism and the risks associated
    with their loans.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent financial institutions successfully moved for summary judgment
    on the basis that there was no cause of action against them.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants ask this court to set aside the summary judgment order.  They
    say the motion judge erred in dismissing their claims in negligence, as against
    the respondent financial institutions, and in failing to recognize that the
    appellants’
    relationships with the respondent financial institutions created fiduciary
    duties that gave rise to genuine issues of fact for trial as to whether those
    duties had been breached.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the motion judge’s determinations in this matter and for the reasons
    that he gave, reasons which are a model of excellence.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge considered the loan documentation of each of the respondent
    financial institutions.  Those documents contained various provisions by
    which the borrowers acknowledge responsibility for the borrowing and investment
    decisions, and disclaim any responsibility on the part of the lender.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying
    on settled law, the motion judge rejected the appellants’ argument that they
    were not bound by such provisions because they had not read the documents.  As
    he noted at paras. 47 and 51 of the reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There was nothing to suggest to the financial institutions
    that they ought to infer that, contrary to what the signed documents said,
    the plaintiffs had not read the documents.  On the face of the documents
    and in view of the fact that they came from the financial advisors, the financial
    institutions were entitled to rely on them and they did so in making the
    loans which they approved based on those documents.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The plaintiffs acknowledge that they knew the loans
    had to be repaid.&nbsp; The record does not show what beliefs, if any, they
    had about what the terms of the loans provided as to repayment.&nbsp; They
    all say they did not read the terms in the loan documents.&nbsp; So they
    had no basis for any particular supposition as to when the lenders could
    require repayment.&nbsp; The subsequent occurrence of the margin calls on
    the discovery of the margin terms may have come to them as a very bad surprise
    but the lenders had done nothing to contribute to any such reaction on the
    part of the plaintiffs, since the terms were fully set out in the loan documents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is settled law also that, barring a special relationship or exceptional circumstances,
    the relationship between a bank and its customer is that of debtor and creditor.  The
    motion judge set out the applicable law at para.&nbsp;78 of the reasons,
    as recently summarized by this court in <i>Pierce v. Canada Trustco Mortgage
    Co. </i>(2005), 254 D.L.R. (4<span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>th</span>) 79 at para.
    27:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Generally speaking, the relationship between a
    financial institution lender and its customer borrower is a purely commercial
    relationship of creditor and debtor.&nbsp; Absent any special relationship
    or exceptional circumstances such as would give rise to a fiduciary duty
    (which is not pleaded by Mrs. Pierce), the courts have consistently held
    that the lender owes no duty to the borrower in connection with the making
    of the loan.&nbsp;
    In particular, the bank owes no duty to its customer to advise the customer
    not to undertake the loan:&nbsp; see <i>Bertolo </i>v. <i>Bank of Montreal</i>,
    (1986), 57 O.R. (2d) 577, 33 D.L.R. (4<span style='font-family:&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>th</span>) 610 (C.A.), and <i>Bank of Montreal </i>v. <i>Duguid</i> (2000),
    47 O.R. (3d) 737, 185 D.L.R. (4<span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New Roman"'>th</span>) 458 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the motion judge that there were no genuine issues of material
    fact with respect to the relationship between the appellants and their respective
    financial institutions.  We adopt the reasons of the motion judge in paras.
    81 to 84 and 87 to 88, as to why there is no evidence of a special relationship
    or exceptional circumstance such that a duty of care to advise was owed by
    the respondent financial institutions to the appellants. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is undeniable that if a person cannot borrow
    money, that person cannot incur a risk of being unable to repay it and that
    person cannot incur a risk of agreeing to borrow without adequately understanding
    and assessing the advisability of the risk.&nbsp; But if the mere fact of
    lending made a lender liable in respect of such risks, it would seem to follow
    that in virtually all circumstances a lender would have a duty to advise
    a borrower about such risks.&nbsp; That position is the exact contrary of
    the position set out in the <i>Pierce</i> decision and the cases referred
    to in that decision.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is understandable that the courts have taken
    the position set out in <i>Pierce</i> and not the contrary position outlined
    above.&nbsp; The simplest kind of case of negligence such as the faulty inspection
    case in <i>Anns</i> does not involve any deliberate action on the part of
    the complainant taken under an agreement with the alleged tortfeasor in which
    all the terms of the agreement that give rise to the special risk have been
    duly disclosed, as is the case here.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>With these additional factors of agreement and
    disclosure, the situation between the parties as regards the proximity of
    the alleged tortfeasor to the prospective risk of harm is materially altered.&nbsp;
    It remains true that the harm could not occur without the making of the loan.&nbsp; But
    the making of the loan requires the consent of two parties, the lender and
    the borrower.&nbsp; And the lender cannot impose the loan on the borrower. &nbsp;So
    where, as here, the borrower has received disclosure of the terms of the
    loan and has been placed in a position to make an assessment of the risk
    (and is in a better position than the lender to do so, because the borrower
    has knowledge of the proposed investment program which the borrower received
    from his or her financial advisor) the analysis of proximity must take these
    relative positions into account.&nbsp; “Proximity” has to do with closeness
    (and its opposite, lack of closeness or “remoteness”) with respect to the
    cause of the harm.&nbsp; The foreseeable harm here would seem to be the loss
    incurred by the occurrence of a margin call (or, perhaps, the unrealized
    but prospective loss where a loan goes out of margin).&nbsp; But the person
    who is closest to the causing of that harm is the person who decided to borrow
    funds to make the investments that could result in that loss.&nbsp; That
    person is the borrower.&nbsp; In the terminology of <i>Anns</i>, the borrower
    has proximity to the cause of the loss.&nbsp; Next in proximity would be
    the financial advisor.&nbsp; Compared to the borrower and the financial advisor,
    the lender does not have proximity.&nbsp; Its loan is necessary but not sufficient
    for the harm.&nbsp;&nbsp;The borrower’s action is necessary and sufficient
    for the harm.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The fact that a loan transaction is made by way
    of an agreement between the parties strongly affects the two critical elements
    of duty of care that are identified in <i>Anns</i>:&nbsp; the nature of the
    relationship between the parties and the degree of proximity between them.&nbsp; Where
    the relationship between the parties is only contractual, the contract necessarily
    determines the reasonable expectations of the parties with regard to each
    other.&nbsp; Where the contract itself does not give the lender a duty to
    advise, there is no reason to consider that such a duty is part of the relationship
    unless there is a special relationship or circumstance which would reasonably
    give rise to such a duty.&nbsp; Similarly, where the relationship is only
    contractual, there is no reason to view the parties as having a proximity
    to the prospective harm that is different from the reasonable expectations
    created by the terms of their contract.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The plaintiffs submit that their cause of action
    in negligence falls into a recognized category of circumstances where a duty
    of negligence has been held to exist.&nbsp; How that category might be properly
    described requires consideration.&nbsp; The plaintiffs say in their factum
    that a duty of care in negligence arises when a person’s conduct creates
    a foreseeable risk of harm to foreseeable persons.&nbsp; But for this formulation
    to be applicable in this case, it is necessary to conclude that the conduct
    of lending creates a foreseeable risk of harm to foreseeable persons.&nbsp; This
    position ignores the point that it is the borrower who decides to take the
    loan and so creates whatever foreseeable risk may thereby arise.&nbsp; The
    position also ignores the fact that it is contrary to what the case law has
    concluded in the case of lending.&nbsp; The case law recognizes that advisors
    have a duty of care in respect of advising, but it has not recognized that
    lenders are advisors.&nbsp; The plaintiffs say that the Court ought to discern
    or draw an analogy between advisors and lenders in this case on the basis
    of the similarity of their circumstances <i>vis-à-vis</i> the plaintiffs
    and the prospect of harm to them.&nbsp; But the differences between the circumstances
    of the advisors and the lenders are more instructive than any similarities.&nbsp;
    The plaintiffs dealt with the financial advisors to obtain their financial
    advice and they say they relied upon that advice.&nbsp; The plaintiffs went
    to the financial institutions, not for advice, but for loans.&nbsp; There
    is no evidence that the plaintiffs placed any reliance on the financial institutions
    with respect to their borrowing and investment decisions other than the self-serving
    evidence, discussed earlier, that they “trusted” the financial institutions.&nbsp; The
    financial advisors knew the intended investment programs of the plaintiffs
    and they were in a position under the applicable regulatory requirements
    to develop and recommend and implement those investment programs for the
    applicants and to monitor them over time.&nbsp; The financial institutions
    were not in this position.&nbsp; No basis for an analogy between the advisors
    and the lenders is apparent.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>On this basis, the relationship between the financial
    institutions to the plaintiffs in this case does not fit within an existing
    category that is recognized as giving rise to a duty of care and it is not
    analogous to an existing category of that kind.&nbsp; So the claim that the
    lender has a duty of care to advise is a claim to recognize a new duty of
    care.&nbsp; A new duty of care could be recognized only if it satisfied,
    first, the <i>Anns</i> test as to proximity.&nbsp; For the reasons given
    above, that test is not satisfied here.&nbsp; The plaintiffs made submissions
    about the applicability of the second stage of the <i>Anns</i> test but,
    since the proposed new duty of care does not get past the first stage of
    the <i>Anns </i>test, the second stage does not become applicable.&nbsp; So
    this approach to the issue of duty of care based on recognized and new categories
    of duty of care does not yield a duty of care.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Like
    the motion judge, we are of the view that the promotion of the investments
    by the respondent financial institutions did not create a special circumstance
    as those promotional efforts were directed to the financial advisors, not
    to the appellants.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    we reject the submission that the respondent financial institutions owed
    the appellants a fiduciary duty to advise them adequately about the loans.  Again,
    we do so for the reasons given by the motion judge.  At paras. 65 to 66 of
    the reasons, he explains:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is well established in the case law that the
    ordinary relationship of lender and borrower does not involve or give rise
    to a fiduciary duty on the part of the lender towards the borrower.&nbsp; See <i>Mastercraft</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at p. 284 in paras. 47 to 49; also <i>Anand</i> v. <i>Medjuck</i>, [1995]
    O.J. No. 2571 (Gen. Div.) at p. 43 at para. 40 and <i>Bank of Montreal</i> v. <i>Witkin</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at paras. 54 and 55 and 59 to 61.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The reason that there is no fiduciary duty is simple.&nbsp; A
    fiduciary duty arises where a relationship between the parties, such as trustee
    and beneficiary, is established in order to give one party the responsibility
    to look out for the best interests of the other.&nbsp; The relationship between
    a lender and a borrower is not of that kind.&nbsp; Rather, it is a typical
    commercial relationship in which the interests of the parties are not the
    same and each party seeks to secure its own interest and can reasonably believe
    only that the other party is doing the same.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent financial institutions
