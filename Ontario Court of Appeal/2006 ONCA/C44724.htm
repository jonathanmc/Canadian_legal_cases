      Tribunal summarized the evidence relating to Ms.&nbsp;Crane’s physical
      and mental functioning.  Her application was based on evidence of
    “fibromyalgia, asthma, anxiety/depression and headaches.”  Fibromyalgia was
    identified by her family doctor, Dr.&nbsp;Jennifer&nbsp;Laski, as the “principal
    condition of impact”
    giving rise to the application and asthma was listed as the one other condition
    in the Health Status Report.  Fatigue, generalized myalgia, irritability
    and emotional lability were listed as the impairments due to the condition
    of fibromyalgia.  In a narrative report dated June&nbsp;16,&nbsp;2003, Dr.&nbsp;Laski
    mentioned that Ms.&nbsp;Crane had a “psychiatric problem”
    comprising the “emotional difficulties” of depression, anxiety and emotional
    lability and that she has “experienced headaches also as a result of the
    anxiety and depression.”  In the same report, Dr.&nbsp;Laski offered the
    opinion that “Mrs.&nbsp;Crane will never be suitable for employment.”  However,
    in a handwritten notation below her signature Dr.&nbsp;Laski recorded “NB
    it has come to my attention since writing this letter that Mrs.&nbsp;Crane
    is working in a convenience store.”  This notation was accurate; Ms.&nbsp;Crane
    had been working two days per week at a convenience store since October&nbsp;2003.</span></p>

      Tribunal took note of Ms.&nbsp;Crane’s testimony about her daily activities:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[S]he is able to go shopping and
      is able to lift ten pounds with the children or her spouse lifting the
      heavier items and carrying the laundry basket.  She is able to knit, sew
      and do professional cake decorating despite the problems she said she had
      with her hands and arms.  She is able to drive, do the banking and attend
      to her personal care with a minimal amount of help from her spouse.  She
      is out of the house four or five times a week for work or boys hockey.  She
      volunteers with the soccer team and hockey associations.</span></p>

      Tribunal then set out its assessment of Ms.&nbsp;Crane’s testimony:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>All this evidence indicates to
      the Tribunal that the Appellant’s impairments have not reached the level
      where they have a substantial impact on her lifestyle.  This assessment
      finds further support in the Activities of Daily Living Report completed
      by the Appellant’s family doctor where the categories are marked from having
      a low moderate impact on lifestyle to having no impact on lifestyle and
      having complete independence or not being applicable.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Tribunal denied Ms.&nbsp;Crane’s appeal.  It concluded:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In order to be found disabled
      under s.&nbsp;4(1) of the act, an applicant must meet two substantial thresholds.  First,
      there must be a substantial impairment.  Secondly, the direct and cumulative
      effect of this impairment must result in a substantial restriction in one
      or more activities of daily living.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The Appellant fails the first
      test of the legislated definition of a person with a disability in that
      she is not found to have a substantial physical or mental impairment.  Having
      found that the Appellant failed to meet the first test, the Tribunal will
      not consider the other tests contained in the legislation.  The appeal
      is denied.</span></p>

      Frank Miclash, the Interim Chair of the Tribunal, denied this request and
      confirmed the Tribunal’s decision.  Ms.&nbsp;Crane appealed to the Divisional
      Court pursuant to s.&nbsp;31(1) of the<i> ODSPA</i>, which provides:</span></p>

      v. Director, Ontario Disability Support Program</i> (2002), 212 D.L.R.
      (4th) 353 (Ont. C.A.) (“<i>Gray</i>”).  In his judgment in <i>Gray</i>,
      McMurtry C.J.O. described the <i>ODSPA</i> as remedial legislation that “should

      order to receive income support, a claimant must establish that she is
      a person with a disability as defined in s.&nbsp;4(1) of the <i>ODSPA</i>.  This
      requires the claimant to meet two different thresholds – first, establish
      that she has a substantial physical or mental impairment that is continuous
      or recurrent and expected to last one year or more (s.&nbsp;4(1)(a)); and
      second, establish that the direct and cumulative affect of the impairment
      results in a substantial restriction in activities of daily living in at
      least one of three domains, namely, personal care, functioning in the community,
      and functioning in the workplace (s.&nbsp;4(1)(b)).  In addition, the “substantial
      impairment” and “substantial restriction” thresholds must be verified by
      a person with prescribed qualifications, presumably, in most cases, a doctor
      (s.&nbsp;4(1)(c)).</span></p>

      consider the concept of impairment in isolation; rather, impairment always
      required a consideration of “damage or weakness of some ability.”  The
      majority concluded, therefore, that
    “[t]aking subparagraph (a) and (b) together, it becomes clear that the determination
    of a person’s claim for benefits cannot stop after an analysis of subparagraph
    (a) alone because the definition of person with a disability is not complete

      on the other hand.  The same distinction is made in s.&nbsp;4(1) of the <i>ODSPA</i>.  Paragraph&nbsp;(a)
      deals with impairment – i.e. deviation or loss in body function or structure;
      paragraph&nbsp;(b) speaks to restrictions in the activities of daily living,
      including personal care, the community and the workplace.  Accordingly,
      the dissenting judge was correct to conclude that s.&nbsp;4(1) mandates
      two separate inquires and that the Tribunal did not err by declining to
      engage in a s.&nbsp;4(1)(b) analysis after concluding that Ms.&nbsp;Crane
      had not established that she had a substantial impairment under s.&nbsp;4(1)(a).</span></p>

      is important to observe, however, that although the inquiries mandated
      by paragraph&nbsp;(a) and (b) of s.&nbsp;4(1) relate to different issues
      or thresholds, the evidence relevant to the two inquiries can overlap.  This
      is so because in some cases a simple description of the deviation or loss
      of body function or structure will not answer the question: is this a substantial
      impairment?  To take but one example, the loss of an entire arm or leg
      would almost certainly constitute, without knowing anything more about
      the person’s activities, a substantial impairment under s.&nbsp;4(1)(a).  However,
      the loss of a single finger or toe would be a different case.  Such an
      injury would be a loss of body structure.  But would it constitute a substantial
      impairment?  In order to answer this question, the inquiry would have to
      go beyond simple medical description and take account of the whole person,
      including some of her activities.  This, of course, opens the door to some
      of the evidence relevant to s.&nbsp;4(1)(b) also being apposite to the
      s.&nbsp;4(1)(a) inquiry.</span></p>

      case law reflects the above analysis.  In <i>Meyer v. Bright</i> (1993),
      15 O.R. (3d) 129 (C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused (1993), 17 O.R.
      (3d) xvi, a five judge panel of this court considered the meaning of
    ‘serious impairment’ in s.&nbsp;266(1) of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;8.  The court stated, at p.&nbsp;142:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>An impairment of an important
      bodily function which is serious to one person may not necessarily be a
      serious one for someone else.  The task of the court  in each case will

      person who is before the court.</span></p>

      similar approach has been taken by the courts in cases dealing with s.&nbsp;4(1)
      of the <i>ODSPA</i>.  In <i>Gray</i>, <i>supra</i>, McMurtry C.J.O. said,
      at para.&nbsp;16:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>With respect to the interpretation
      of the word “substantial” in s.&nbsp;4(1)(a) of the <i>ODSPA</i>, I am

      the varying circumstances of each individual case in a manner consistent
      with the purposes of the Act.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      a similar vein, McMurtry C.J.O. stated, at para.&nbsp;8, that he was “in
      particular agreement with the following statement of Lang&nbsp;J. in <i>Ontario
      (Director, Disability Support Program) v. Gallier</i>, [2000] O.J. No.
      4541 (Div. Ct.):</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is our view that the Tribunal was entitled to
    consider the applicant in the context of her own situation.  We are supported
    in this regard by the wording of s.&nbsp;4(1) which requires a consideration
    of “the person”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>If
      the inquiry relating to
    ‘substantial impairment’ under s.&nbsp;4(1)(a) of the <i>ODSPA</i> must encompass “the
    particular injured person before the court” (<i>Meyer v. Bright</i>),
    “the varying circumstances of each individual case” (<i>Gray</i>), or “the
    applicant in the context of her own situation” (<i>Gallier</i>), it is inevitable
    that some of the analysis under s.&nbsp;4(1)(a) will include some of the
    factors in s.&nbsp;4(1)(b).  It will be impossible, in some cases, to be
    faithful to the person&#8209;specific consideration of substantial impairment
    mandated by <i>Gray</i> and other cases without examining such matters as
    personal care and the person’s functioning in the community and the workplace.  Indeed,
    this precise point was recognized and affirmed in another case dealing with
    the interpretation of s.&nbsp;4(1)(a), <i>McLaughlin v. Ontario (Director,
    Disability Support Program)</i>, [2002] O.J. No.&nbsp;1740 (Div. Ct.), wherein
    Blair&nbsp;J. stated, at para.&nbsp;2:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Ms.&nbsp;McCormick also argued that the Tribunal
    erred by imputing the substantial&#8209;restriction&#8209;of&#8209;daily&#8209;activities
    concept of s.&nbsp;4(1)(b) into its “substantial impairment”
    consideration.  We do not think it was an error on the part of the Tribunal
    to take into account factors relating to the appellant’s physical impairment
    that might also be pertinent to a s.&nbsp;4(1)(b) analysis when they are
    also pertinent to the substantial impairment determination.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>In my view, this
      is precisely right.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      summary, s.&nbsp;4(1) of the <i>ODSPA</i> presents three questions – substantial
      impairment, substantial restriction in certain activities, and verification.  These
      are separate questions that require separate analysis and answers.  The
      onus is on the claimant to establish all three factors.  Accordingly, if
      the Tribunal concludes that the claimant has failed to establish one of
      the factors, it need not deal with the other factors.  Finally, in some
      cases (but not all) there can be an overlap in the evidence relevant to
      the factors in paragraphs&nbsp;(a) and (b) of s.&nbsp;4(1).  That is because
      although the concept of impairment is anchored in medicine, the determination
      of whether an impairment is substantial will require consideration of the
      whole person, including a person’s ability to function in the domains of
      personal care, community and workplace.</span></p>

      respect to s.&nbsp;4(1)(a), it focused on the medical evidence relating

      notes of the family doctor, and reports by a rheumatologist and a psychiatrist.</span></p>

      the decision of this court in <i>Gray</i>, which it cited, the Tribunal
      considered the medical evidence in the context of the factors set out in
      s.&nbsp;4(1)(b), namely, Ms.&nbsp;Crane’s ability to function in the community
      and the workplace.  </span></p>

      of the <i>ODSPA</i>.  In approaching this issue in the fashion it did,

    Tribunal specifically addressed and quoted from only one report of one of
    the medical persons whose evidence was before the Tribunal.  That quotation
    was from a report of Dr.&nbsp;Jennifer Laski, the appellant’s family doctor
    who had examined the appellant numerous times between September&nbsp;1999,

      statement is simply wrong.  In its extensive review of the medical information
      relating to Ms.&nbsp;Crane, the Tribunal referred to not only Dr.&nbsp;Laski’s

      and Dr.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Krishna, a psychiatrist.  Indeed, the only medical

      had been working for approximately three years on a part&#8209;time basis
      whereas in fact she had been working at a convenience store for only four
      months prior to the hearing.  I agree with the majority’s analysis on this

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Ms.&nbsp;Crane] now works at a convenience store
    two days a week since October 2003.  Previously she worked for two and one
    half years housekeeping at a motel but quit because it was too physical and

  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The second reference
      occurred later, under the heading REASONS FOR DECISION.  The Tribunal referred
      to the handwritten notation in Dr.&nbsp;Laski’s report concerning Ms.&nbsp;Crane’s

      Ms.&nbsp;Crane’s testimony that she had been working “for approximately

      of these references make it clear that the Tribunal’s view of the evidence
      was that Ms.&nbsp;Crane had been working continuously for three years prior
      to the hearing.  This was an error.  The record, including the Tribunal’s
      handwritten notes of the evidence at the hearing, establishes that Ms.&nbsp;Crane
      had been working at the convenience store on a part&#8209;time basis for
      four months immediately prior to the hearing.  However, her previous part&#8209;time
      position as a housekeeper at a local motel had ended two&#8209;and&#8209;a&#8209;half

      of the evidence amounted to a palpable and overriding error.  The Tribunal
      made the same error twice, so there can be no suggestion that the error
      was merely a typographical error.  The error relates to a crucial part
      of the evidence, namely, Ms.&nbsp;Crane’s work history.  The error is a
      substantial one – there is a large difference between four months and three
      years continuous part&#8209;time work.  Finally, as McMurtry&nbsp;C.J.O.
      emphasized in <i>Gray</i>, the <i>ODSPA</i> is remedial legislation.  It
      follows from these points that Ms.&nbsp;Crane is entitled to have her claim
