  <h2>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Marshall Johnston was the General Manager of the Ottawa
    Senators Hockey Club from June 1999 to June 2002.  During that period, Ray Mlakar was the President and CEO of the
    Senators and Mark Goudie was a Vice President.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After his employment ended, Mr. Johnston started a civil
    action for misrepresentation.  He
    alleged that during the negotiation of his employment agreement, Mssrs. Mlakar
    and Goudie represented to him and his lawyer, Mr. Bourbonnais, that the
    compensation he would receive as General Manager would be the same as that
    which had been paid to his predecessor.  In response to the claim, Mr. Goudie commenced a third party claim
    against Mr. Bourbonnais and issued a counterclaim against Mr. Johnston.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Mlakar brought a motion in which he sought, pursuant to s.
    7(1) of the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991</i>, S.O. 1991, c.&nbsp;17 (the “<i>Act</i>”),
    to have Mr. Johnston’s action stayed and the matter referred to arbitration by
    the Commissioner for the NHL.  He relied
    on s. 10 of the employment contract and the terms of the NHL Constitution which
    give the Commissioner exclusive jurisdiction to arbitrate employment-related
    disputes between member clubs, players and League employees and to resolve
    matters that may be detrimental to the best interests of the League or
    professional hockey.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By order dated December&nbsp;2,&nbsp;2005, McWilliam J.
    dismissed the motion.  One of the bases
    on which he refused to stay the action was that there was a reasonable
    apprehension of bias in relation to the Commissioner.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Mlakar appeals.  The NHL was granted standing to intervene.  It supports the appellant’s request to have the motion judge’s
    order set aside.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, we would dismiss the appeal.    </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion below appears to have proceeded on the assumption
    that Mr. Johnston was a party to an arbitration agreement and, therefore, that
    s. 7(1) of the <i>Act </i>applies.  In
    our view, however, Mr. Johnston is not a “party to an arbitration agreement”
    and s. 7(1) is inapplicable.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 7(1) reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> 7.(1) If a party to an arbitration agreement
    commences a proceeding in respect of a matter to be submitted to arbitration
    under the agreement, the court in which the proceeding is commenced shall, on
    the motion of another party to the arbitration agreement, stay the proceeding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To begin with the obvious, there is no arbitration agreement <i>per
    se </i>in this matter.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept that the Constitution, standing alone, brings
    the matter within the purview of s. 7(1) as Mr. Johnston is not a party to the
    Constitution. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assuming that the employment agreement is an “arbitration
    agreement” for the purposes of s. 7(1), it must be determined whether the
    employment agreement contains a provision requiring Mr. Johnston to submit
    disputes of this sort to arbitration.  There is no such express provision to that effect.  The appellant and intervenor argue that s.
    10 of the employment agreement has that effect, however.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The relevant part of paragraph 10 of the employment agreement
    reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>10. Constitution
    and Bylaws</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> The Manager
    acknowledges that the Club is bound by the Constitution and Bylaws of the
    National Hockey League and … agrees to diligently pursue all actions reasonably
    required by the General Manager to assure the Club’s adherence to and
    compliance with such Constitution and Bylaws. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To again state the obvious: s. 10 does not state that disputes
    between the contracting parties are to be resolved by arbitration or according
    to the terms of the Constitution.  Nor
    does s. 10 provide that Mr. Johnston agrees to submit any disputes he might
    have to arbitration or to resolve such disputes in accordance with the terms of
    the Constitution.  Section 10 does,
    however, expressly provide that the Club is bound by the Constitution.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant and intervenor argue that s. 10 should be
    interpreted to mean that Mr. Johnston agreed that he would be bound by the
    Constitution, including its arbitration provisions.  They say that would have been the reasonable expectation of the
    parties to the employment agreement as Mr. Johnston knew that the Club was
    bound by the Constitution and that his role as General Manager was to ensure
    that the Club would comply with the Constitution.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept this argument.  Had the parties intended that Mr. Johnston be bound by the
    Constitution or that he be required to submit disputes to arbitration, it would
    have been a simple matter to have inserted terms to that effect into the
    agreement.  In our view, clear language
    is necessary in order to take away the right of a person to have recourse to
    the courts.       </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We conclude, therefore, that as Mr. Johnston is not a party to
    an arbitration agreement, s. 7(1) of the <i>Act </i>does not apply and cannot
    provide a basis on which to stay his action.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One further matter warrants comment.  Through a letter from counsel to the NHL sent prior to commencing
    civil proceedings, Mr. Johnston made inquiries about proceeding by arbitration
    to resolve his compensation dispute.  In
    part, the letter sought to clarify the question of what entity would be
    responsible for payment of any arbitration award in light of the fact that the
    Senators’ NHL franchise had been sold pursuant to proceedings under the <i>Companies’
    Creditors Arrangement Act</i>.  In our
    view, this letter does not operate to bar Mr. Johnston from bringing a civil
    proceeding.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As we have found s. 7(1) of the <i>Act</i> to be inapplicable,
    there is no need to go further and consider s. 7(5).  That said, we agree with the motion judge that the more just
    course is for the court to assume jurisdiction over the entire dispute,
    including the claims and counterclaims involving Mr. Goudie and the third-party
    claim against Mr. Bourbonnais.  Mr.
    Goudie is no longer employed by the NHL; the events underpinning his
    counterclaim occurred when neither he nor Mr. Johnston were employed by the
    NHL; and, Mr. Bourbonnais has never been affiliated with the NHL.  Thus, on any view of the proceedings, the
    Commissioner does not have jurisdiction over at least some of the parties and
    claims.  Given the interrelatedness of
    the various claims, having some of the claims decided by arbitration while
    having the other related claims proceed in the courts would lead to an
    unnecessary multiplicity of proceedings.  Such a result runs contrary to s.&nbsp;138 of the <i>Courts of Justice
    Act</i>, which provides that “As far as possible, multiplicity of legal
    proceedings shall be avoided”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of our conclusion in respect to s. 7(1) of the <i>Act</i>,
    it is unnecessary to decide whether the motion judge was entitled to consider
    allegations of bias on the motion to stay and, if so, whether he applied the
    correct test. </p>
