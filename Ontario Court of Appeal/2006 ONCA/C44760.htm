      Newmarket, Ontario.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;'>ENDORSEMENT</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Schickedanz Bros. Limited
    (“Schickedanz”) and York Region Common Element Condominium Corporation No.
    967 (“YRCECC”) appeal the decision of Loukidelis J. dated December 15, 2005
    asking that his order be set aside.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents herein
    sought a declaration before Loukidelis J. that the conduct of Schickedanz,
    in registering a declaration in February 2002, was oppressive, unfairly prejudicial
    to the respondents, and entirely disregarded their interests.  The impugned
    declaration created a Common Elements Condominium Corporation (“CECC”) which
    is a type of condominium corporation authorized by the <i>Condominium Act</i> (“the
    Act”).  A CECC contains common elements, but no units.  Rather, parcels of
    land are “tied” to the CECC and these parcels are called “Potls” which are
    responsible for the common expenses related to the CECC.  In the present
    case, the CECC was created in order to facilitate the maintenance and management
    of the ring road within the development.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Essentially, Schickedanz
    did not want the undeveloped Potls to contribute to common expenses related
    to the CECC because these were vacant parcels and hence there was no reason
    for them to contribute to the maintenance of a ring road they were not using.  The
    result was the declaration creating a bifurcated expense formula which had
    the effect of saddling the developed phase with over 75% of the common expenses
    in 2002-03 and over 48% of the expenses thereafter.  Phase 2, when it was
    registered, would have to pay approximately 34% of the expenses and it was
    the two vacant land condominium corporations (VLCC’s) who objected to this
    disproportionate sharing of expenses and who commenced the application before
    Loukidelis J.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is important to note
    that the bifurcated expense formula outlined in the declaration was disclosed
    to all prospective purchasers of units in the two respondent corporations.  Non-disclosure
    is not the issue for the respondents herein, but rather that the bifurcated
    formula set out in the declaration was contrary to the Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are three issues
    before us.  First, are the disputed sections of the declaration inconsistent
    with the Act?  Second, did Schickedanz act in a manner oppressive or unfairly
    prejudicial to the respondents?  And, third, if the appeal were to be dismissed
    on the first two issues, should Schickedanz be given credit for payments
    it made to YRCECC No. 967 while it owned units of the respondents?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the application
    judge erred in his interpretation of the requirements mandated by the Act,
    which requires the declaration to set out the proportionate contribution
    of each Potl to the common expenses.  We conclude that the appellants’ declaration
    clearly did so and the provision in the Act prohibiting an owner from being
    exempt from its common expense obligations is irrelevant as the obligations
    are determined by the terms found in the declaration.  We conclude there
    is no conflict between the declaration and the Act and therefore the formula
    ought to stand.  The proper time for unit holders of the VLCC’s to complain
    about the common expense formula would be at the time they were presented
    with the declaration.  The Act provides purchasers with a ten-day window
    in which to rescind any offer to purchase granting purchasers a period of
    time to consider the terms and determine whether or not they think they are
    fair.  If purchasers disagreed with the bifurcated formula set out in the
    declaration, they were free within that window of opportunity to walk away
    and rescind their offer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Without question, the
    Act is to prevail over the declaration in situations where the declaration
    conflicts with the Act.  In such a case, an impugned declaration would be
    void.  In the present case, however, we cannot see how the impugned sections
    of the declaration in any way conflict with the Act.  Section 84(1) of the
    Act states, </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>84.(1) Subject to the other provisions of this
    Act, the owners shall contribute to the common expenses in the proportions
    specified in the declaration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    84(3) states,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>84.(3) An owner is not exempt from the obligation
    to contribute to the common expenses even if, </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a) the owner has waived or abandoned the right
    to use the common elements or part of them;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b) the owner is making a claim against the
    corporation; or</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(c) the declaration, by-laws or rules restrict
    the owner from using the common elements or part of them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    purpose of the latter subsection is not to prevent a 0% allocation in the
    declaration, but rather to prevent a unit owner or a Potl owner in the context
    of a CECC from resiling from his or her obligation to contribute to common
    expenses as apportioned by the declaration.  We recognize, as did the Court
    in <i>York Region Condominium Corp. No. 771 v. Year Full Investment (Canada)
    Inc</i>., [1993] O.J. no. 769 [Q.L.] (O.C.A.) 5, that non-usage is not a
    reason for non-payment of common expenses.  However, in the present case,
    it is not the appellants’ non-usage of the common element (the ring road)
    that is the source of their refusal to contribute, but rather the absence
    of any obligation pursuant to the declaration.  Clearly, the appellants set
    up the bifurcated formula so that only users of the ring road should pay
    for its upkeep.  That was clearly spelled out in the declaration, which was
    fully disclosed to purchasers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    to the second issue, we recognize that the bifurcated formula clearly favoured
    the interests of Schickedanz at the expense of the unit holders, but in our
    view, it does not necessarily follow that this conduct was either oppressive
    or highly prejudicial.  This formula was created before the unit holders
    purchased their property and since the impugned provisions of the declaration
    do not violate the Act, there can be no grounds for finding that Schickedanz
    acted oppressively.  We recognize that in <i>Mckinstry v. York Condominium
    Corp. 472,</i> (2003), 68 O.R. (3d) 557 9 (O.S.C.J.), Jurianz J. (as he then
    was) noted that the oppression remedy could be used to protect stakeholders
    from unlawful conduct, as well as from conduct that, while technically legal,
    could be oppressive.  That is not the situation here.  The appellants fully
    complied with s. 84 of the Act by collecting, pursuant to the declaration,
    the common expenses owed by the Polts.  Just as in <i>Peel Condominium Corp.
    No. 417 v. Tedley Homes</i> [1997] Carswell No. 2998 (O.C.A.), the allocation
    of common expenses in this case by Schickedanz was not for a devious purpose,
    but rather for a reasonable and legitimate business purpose which related
    to the staged nature of this development.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    final word.  In <i>Abdool v. Somerset Place Developments of Georgetown Ltd</i>.,
    [1992] Carswell No. 620 (O.C.A.) this court, in interpreting s. 52 of the
    Act, held, </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>While I may generally agree with the learned judge’s
    critique of legislation, I am unable to accept his approach to the current
    disclosure statements.  In my respectful opinion, this approach fails to
    construe s. 52 in a manner that properly balances consumer protection and
    the <u>commercial realities</u> of the condominium industry and, if adopted,
    would require a disclosure document incompatible with the underlying aim
    of the section.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, s. 7(2)(c) and (d) of the Act and s. 40(6)(c) and (d) of the regulations
    ought to be interpreted in light of the commercial realities of the condominium
    industry.  As noted, in this case, each purchaser in this development had
    the option of deciding whether or not to purchase based upon the terms disclosed
    in the declaration.  It is not oppressive for a developer declarant to register
    and implement a properly disclosed declaration so long as it is in compliance
    with the Act and its regulations.  If declarants could not rely upon the
    terms of a declaration which fully complied with the Act and was fully disclosed
    to purchasers, there would be shocking implications for the industry.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    we allow this appeal in respect of the first two grounds, it is unnecessary
    for us to deal with the issue of payment credits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is allowed with costs, which we fix at $14,000 all inclusive.</p>
