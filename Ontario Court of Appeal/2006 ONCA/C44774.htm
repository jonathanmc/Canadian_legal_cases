      appellant appeals from his conviction on a charge of sexually assaulting
      A.D., his young daughter.  There is one ground of appeal.  Counsel for
      the appellant submits that the reasons of the trial judge are inadequate
      in that they do not offer any explanation for the total rejection of the
      appellant’s exculpatory evidence.  He contends that in the circumstances
      of this case, where the Crown’s evidence was not overwhelming and the appellant’s
      evidence was not obviously unreliable, the trial judge’s failure to give
      any reason for rejecting the appellant’s evidence constitutes an error
      in law or a miscarriage of justice and necessitates a new trial.</span></p>

      would dismiss the appeal.  The real question where an appeal is based on
      the alleged inadequacy of the reasons is whether those reasons permit effective
      appellate review of the verdict.  The reasons of the trial judge demonstrate
      a careful consideration of the entirety of the evidence, an appreciation
      of the potential weaknesses in the evidence of the complainant, A.D., an
      understanding of the position of the defence and the appellant’s evidence,
      and a proper application of the relevant legal principles, especially the
      reasonable doubt standard.  The trial judge’s reasons permit effective
      appellate review and reveal the path he followed to conviction.  </span></p>

      alleged sexual assault took place in February 2003 when A.D. was living
      with her father and her three brothers.  She was nine years old.  At that
      time, A.D. was having little or no contact with her mother.  About a year
      later in the spring of 2004, A.D. started to visit with her mother.  In
      June 2004, she told her mother that she had been sexually assaulted by
      the appellant.  The police were called and the appellant was arrested.  He
      was released on bail shortly after his arrest.  A diary belonging to A.D.
      was found in her bedroom in the appellant’s home in the course of a search
      executed while the appellant was in custody following his arrest.  The
      diary figured prominently in the trial.</span></p>

      trial took place in September 2005 in the Superior Court.  By this time,
      A.D. was eleven.  Prior to trial, A.D. had given the police a videotaped
      statement and she had testified at the preliminary inquiry.  A.D. and the
      appellant were the only witnesses at the trial.  Their evidence took most
      of one day (about 130 pages of transcript).  The next morning, counsel
      for the appellant and Crown made their closing submissions (twenty-one
      pages of transcript).  Counsel agreed that this was a “she said – he said” case
      that turned on the credibility of the two key witnesses.  Both counsel
      reviewed the evidence and advanced their respective positions.  The trial
      judge was fully engaged during submissions and directed several questions
      to both counsel.  </span></p>

      talk about an incident involving her stepbrother.  A.D. had been sexually
      assaulted by her stepbrother about a year before.  According to A.D., her
      father told her that she was confused about “men’s parts” and that he could

      her underwear and he told her to get on top of him again.  She did so and
      he started “moving up and down as motions of sex”.  The appellant was nude
      and A.D. described his “dick” as touching her vagina.  She later indicated

      moving up and down again.  After this second episode, the appellant nudged

      read an excerpt from her diary that the Crown had given to her the night
      before she testified.  That excerpt was dated February 6, 2003.  A.D. had

      his arrest.  By the end of the trial, the defence accepted that the entries

      by “licking her vagina” (misspelled in the diary) and by “humping my butt” (misspelled
      in the diary).  A.D. also wrote that her father told her that he would

      they were doing was wrong.  A.D. wrote that she told him that she thought
      it was wrong, but that he started the sexual activity a second time, assuring
      her that it was not against the law.  A.D. wrote that the appellant indicated
      that he was “just about to come” when he stopped the activity again and
      sent A.D. out of the room.  He told her that what they did was totally

      often, meaning that A.D. would have to change schools frequently.  Her
      father was a strict disciplinarian and seemed to favour his sons over A.D.  He
      had a bad temper and sometimes hit the children.  He also made promises
      to them that he did not keep.  The appellant was also in difficult financial

      cross-examination, A.D. conceded that at the preliminary inquiry she had
      not testified that the appellant’s penis penetrated her vagina.  At trial,
      she said it penetrated her vagina on all three occasions when she sat on
      top of him.  She also agreed in cross-examination that she did not testify

      behind.  A.D. said that her father had done so.  This answer given during
      cross-examination was the first indication by A.D. that her father had
      placed his penis in her anus during the sexual assault.  The trial judge
      asked A.D. how this had happened and A.D. explained how she was positioned

      in 1998.  Between 1998 and 2004, he had custody of A.D. and her three brothers.  Their
      mother saw the children sporadically during this time.  He agreed that
      when the children were living with him, they had to change schools quite
      often.  He also agreed that he was a strict disciplinarian, hit his children
      on occasion, and required that they abide by his rules.  The appellant
      acknowledged that money was tight and he was unable to give the children
      the material things that other children had.  The lack of financial resources
      caused various disappointments for all of the children, including A.D.  The
      appellant did not think that he favoured his sons over A.D., although he
      did admit on one occasion there was not enough money to permit A.D. to
      participate in hockey, even though there was enough money to allow her

      sexual matters.  He described sexual intercourse to her and explained how
      it was part of a normal relationship between men and women.  The appellant

    is one of the peculiarities of the criminal justice system that if an accused
    is tried by a jury, the law demands a one or two word verdict and forbids
    any explanation of that verdict.  However, if the same accused is tried on
    the same charge by a judge alone, the same law demands a reasoned explanation
    for the verdict.</p>

    judge alone trials, the reasons for the judgment are the focus of most appeals.   Prior
    to <i>R. v. Sheppard</i> (2002), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 298 (S.C.C.), and its companion
    case, <i>R. v. Braich</i> (2002), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 324 (S.C.C.), arguments
    based on the inadequacies in the trial judge’s reasons took either or both
    of two tacks.  In some cases, it was argued that an inadequacy in the reasons
    demonstrated an underlying or implicit legal error in the trial judge’s reasoning
    process.  Perhaps the best example is the argument made in many appeals that
    the failure to refer to the principles in <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    demonstrates a misapplication of the reasonable doubt standard to credibility
    determinations:  see e.g. <i>R. v. Strong</i>, [2001] O.J. No. 1362 (C.A.).</p>

line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second approach is to point to the inadequacies in the reasons to support
    a claim that the verdict is unreasonable within the meaning of s. 686(1)(a)(i)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  In this context, the inadequacies in the reasons
    are said to reflect errors or gaps in the trial judge’s legal analysis or
    the processing of the evidence and are offered to explain how the judge,
    presumably a reasonable person, could have arrived at an unreasonable verdict:  see
    e.g. <i>R. v. Biniaris</i> (2000), 143 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at para. 36 (S.C.C.).</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Post <i>Sheppard</i> and <i>Braich</i>,
    a third genre of argument based on alleged inadequacies in the trial judge’s
    reasons has flourished.  On this argument, inadequacies in the reasons are
    sufficient to justify reversal in their own right without inferring any underlying
    legal error from those inadequacies and without finding that the verdict
    was unreasonable.  These two cases hold that the absence of reasons (<i>Sheppard</i>)
    or seriously inadequate reasons (<i>Braich</i>) can constitute a freestanding
    error of law justifying the quashing of the verdict and the direction of
    a new trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Sheppard</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at para. 53, Binnie J. stressed that a claim that reasons for judgment are
    inadequate and that the inadequacy amounts to an error in law must be tested
    functionally and in the context of the specific case.  He acknowledged, at
    paras. 18-23, that reasons served various salutary purposes in the criminal
    justice process, including informing the losing party of why he or she had
    lost.  In the context of appellate review, however, Binnie J., at para. 25,
    described the function of reasons for judgment in these terms:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The issue before
    us presupposes that the decision has been appealed.  <u>In that context the
    purpose, in my view, is to preserve and enhance meaningful appellate review
    of the correctness of the decision (which embraces both errors of law and
    palpable overriding errors of fact).  If deficiencies in the reasons do not,
    in a particular case, foreclose meaningful appellate review, but allow for
    its full exercise, the deficiency will not justify intervention under s.
    686 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    a review of the cases, Binnie J. returned to what he saw as the crucial question
    on appellate review of the adequacy of trial reasons at para. 46:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>These cases
    make it clear, <u>I think, that the duty to give reasons, where it exists,
    arises out of the circumstances of a particular case.</u>  Where it is plain
    from the record why an accused has been convicted or acquitted, and the absence
    or inadequacy of reasons provides no significant impediment to the exercise
    of the right of appeal, the appeal court will not on that account intervene.  On
    the other hand, where the path taken by the trial judge through confused
    or conflicting evidence is not at all apparent, or there are difficult issues
    of law that need to be confronted but which the trial judge has circumnavigated
    without explanation, or where (as here) there are conflicting theories for
    why the trial judge might have decided as he or she did, at least some of
    which would clearly constitute reversible error, <u>the appeal court may
    in some cases consider itself unable to give effect to the statutory right
    of appeal.  In such a case, one or other of the parties may question the
    correctness of the result, but will wrongly have been deprived by the absence
    or inadequacy of reasons of the opportunity to have the trial verdict properly
    scrutinized on appeal.</u>  In such a case, even if the record discloses
    evidence that on one view could support a reasonable verdict, the deficiencies
    in the reasons may amount to an error of law and justify appellate intervention.  It
    will be for the appeal court to determine whether, in a particular case,
    the deficiency in the reasons precludes it from properly carrying out its
    appellate function.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    circumstances of the particular case will determine the adequacy of the reasons
    for judgment and the effect, if any, of the inadequacy of reasons or the
    outcome of the appeal.  Reasons for judgment must be examined in the context
    of the entire proceeding, especially the nature of the evidence heard and
    the arguments advanced.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    should appellate courts overestimate the complexity of most criminal litigation
    or underestimate the ability of those involved in the trial process to understand
    the reasons for the outcome.  Most criminal trials, even the difficult ones,
    are not particularly complicated.  Most accused, even those who vehemently
    disagree with the result, understand only too well why they were convicted.  Once
    again, I return to the words of Binnie J. in <i>Sheppard</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at para. 60:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[I]n the vast
    majority of criminal cases both the issues and the pathway taken by the trial
    judge to the result will likely be clear to all concerned.  Accountability
    seeks basic fairness, not perfection, and does not justify an undue shift
    in focus from the correctness of the result to an esoteric dissection of
    the words used to express the reasoning process behind it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his submissions, counsel stressed that the trial judge’s reasons offered
    no explanation for his outright rejection of the appellant’s evidence.  Counsel
    argued that where the Crown’s case cannot be described as overwhelming, and
    an accused’s evidence is not self-evidently unreliable or incredible, the
    trial judge’s failure to give a reasoned explanation for the rejection of
    the accused’s evidence constitutes an error in law.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Certainly,
    a trial judge owes it to an accused to explain his or her reasons for convicting
    that accused.  Where the accused has testified, this will include an explanation
    for rejecting the accused’s denial.  However, where the sufficiency of the
    reasons is challenged on appeal, the outcome of the appeal must turn on whether
    there can be a meaningful appellate review of the trial proceedings:  see <i>R.
    v. G.(L.)</i> (2006), 207 C.C.C. (3d) 353 at para. 14 (S.C.C.).  This is
    evident from the observation in <i>Sheppard</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 55:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Where the trial
    decision is deficient in explaining the result to the parties, but the appeal
    court considers itself able to do so, the appeal court’s explanation in its
    own reasons is sufficient.  There is no need in such a case for a new trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    focusing on reviewability of the proceedings as the ultimate issue, I do
    not diminish the significance of the absence of any discernible explanation
    for the rejection of an accused’s seemingly plausible denial.  The absence
    of any explanation may go a long way toward putting the reasons beyond the
    reach of meaningful appellate review:  see <i>R. v. Maharaj</i> (2004), 186
    C.C.C. (3d) 247 at paras. 26-29 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused,
    [2004] S.C.C.A. No. 340.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    some circumstances, a trial judge’s failure to adequately explain the reasons
    for rejecting an accused’s denial will make it impossible for the appellate
    court to satisfy itself that the conviction was based on an application of
    the correct legal principles to findings of fact that were reasonably open
    to the trial judge.  There are several examples of circumstances in which
    this court has linked the absence of clear reasons for rejecting exculpatory
    evidence with the inability to engage in effective appellate review:  see <i>R.
    v. Maharaj</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 29;  <i>R. v. Lagace</i> (2003), 181
    C.C.C. (3d) 12 at para. 44 (Ont. C.A.);  <i>R. v. D.(S.J.)</i> (2004), 186
    C.C.C. (3d) 304 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2004] S.C.C.A.
    No. 365.</p>

line-height:normal'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    other cases, the trial judge’s failure to explicitly point to factors in
    the appellant’s evidence justifying his or her rejection of that evidence
    does not foreclose meaningful appellate review:  see e.g. <i>R. v. R.L.</i>,
    [2002] O.J. No. 3061 at para. 3 (C.A.);  <i>R. v. S.(A.)</i> (2002), 165
    C.C.C. (3d) 426 at paras. 33-34 (Ont. C.A.);  <i>R. v. Tzarfin</i>, [2005]

    is no jurisprudential difference of opinion underlying the different results
    reached in the cases referred to above.  The different results reflect the
    functional and contextual assessments of the adequacy of reasons dictated
    in <i>Sheppard</i> and <i>Braich</i>.  On that approach, a deficiency in
    the reasons will in some cases render the reasons inadequate, but that same
    deficiency will not have that effect in other cases where the context is
    different.  </p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Also, the absence
    of adequate reasons for rejecting the appellant’s evidence makes meaningful
    appellate review problematic.  <u>This court cannot be satisfied that the

    the court could not be satisfied that the fundamental principles applicable

    reasons, said at para. 34:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Based on the
    totality of the evidence, the trial judge is entitled to believe the complainant
    and to reject the denial of the accused.  <u>Here the trial judge first set
    out his rejection of the evidence of the accused without a clear explanation
    for that rejection.  However, later in his reasons he explained why he accepted
    the evidence of the complainant as being true.  Nothing in the evidence of
    the appellant raised a doubt in the mind of the trial judge.</u>  He was
    entitled to make that assessment and those findings based on all the evidence

    J.A. and Laskin J.A. both engaged in a contextual and functional analysis
    of the adequacy of the reasons.  Based on the respective records before them,
    they reached different conclusions.  Feldman J.A. could be satisfied that
    the proper standard of proof had been applied by the trial judge.  Laskin
    J.A. could not be so satisfied.  In the case before Feldman J.A., the reasons

    turn now to the reasons for judgment in this case.  This is not a case like <i>Sheppard</i> where
    the trial judge did not give any meaningful reasons.  The complaint is with
    the adequacy of the reasons.  Like the reasons in <i>Braich</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at para. 20: “There is no doubt what the trial judge decided and how he reached

    was to be applied in a “<span lang=EN-US>she said – he said</span>” case
    like the one before him.  He specifically acknowledged that the reasonable

    potential frailties in her evidence, particularly the fact that she had provided
    many details of the alleged assault in her evidence that she had not given
    in her earlier statements and testimony.  The trial judge expressly alluded
    to many of the inconsistencies between her testimony and her earlier statements.  He
    also took into consideration the circumstances surrounding her testimony.  The
    trial judge ultimately determined that A.D. was a credible witness.  He gave
    reasons for this conclusion.  The basis upon which the trial judge found
    A.D. credible is readily apparent on the entirety of the record, including

    that A.D. was credible, the trial judge was not prepared to conclude beyond

    addition to his assessment of the respective credibility of the two main
    witnesses, the trial judge also considered the diary.  As he put it in his
    reasons:  “There is more to this case, however, than what each of the parties
    have said in the trial, and that is what can be derived from A.D.’s diary.”</p>

    trial judge proceeded in his reasons to consider the circumstances in which
    the diary was discovered, the contents of the three entries that were placed
    in evidence, the timing of the making of the entry dated February 6, and
    the contents of that entry.  </p>

    trial judge concluded that the diary was A.D.’s “recording of a running series
    of events.”  I take this to mean that the trial judge was satisfied that
    the February 6 entry that described the sexual assault was made between the
    dates of the other two entries, the first being December 5, 2002, and the
    third being February 8, 2003.  The trial judge proceeded to find that a diary
    entry made between those dates rebutted trial counsel for the appellant’s
    suggestion that A.D. had fabricated her allegations after she started to
    visit her mother so that she could go and live with her mother.  Although
    the trial judge did not expressly so state, it is clear to me that the trial
    judge was referring to fabrication at or about the time A.D. reported the
    alleged assault to her mother in the spring of 2004.  </p>

    was open to the trial judge to conclude that the diary was written at or
    about February 6, 2003.  It was unchallenged that A.D. wrote the diary entry
    and that neither she nor her mother had anything to do with the police obtaining
    possession of the diary.  </p>

    trial judge’s analysis of the evidence demonstrates the route he took to
    his verdict and permits effective appellate review.  The trial judge rejected
    totally the appellant’s denial because stacked beside A.D.’s evidence and
    the evidence concerning the diary, the appellant’s evidence, despite the
    absence of any obvious flaws in it, did not leave the trial judge with a
    reasonable doubt.  An outright rejection of an accused’s evidence based on
    a considered and reasoned acceptance beyond a reasonable doubt of the truth
    of conflicting credible evidence is as much an explanation for the rejection
    of an accused’s evidence as is a rejection based on a problem identified
    with the way the accused testified or the substance of the accused’s evidence.</p>

    the trial judge’s reasons, the appellant knew why he was convicted.  His

    diary, satisfied the trial judge of the appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable

    available to him on the evidence, and ultimately returned a verdict based
    on the evidence and the application of the relevant legal principles to that
