    is an appeal from the order of Justice Farley of the Superior Court of Justice
    (“the motion judge”) dated December 23, 2005.  The motion judge refused to
    fully vacate and declare void <i>ab initio</i> certain notices of garnishment
    issued on November 4, 2005 on behalf of Solid Waste Reclamation Inc. (“SWR”)
    and served on CIBC Wood Gundy, CIBC, HSBC Bank Canada and Manulife Bank (“the

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    matter arises out of the multiple and complex litigation between two brothers,
    Morris and Chester Waxman and their families concerning <i>inter alia</i> the
    ownership of the shares of I. Waxman &amp; Sons Limited (“IWS”).  Morris
    and Chester Waxman are referred to hereafter by their first names as a matter
    of convenience.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    a lengthy trial, Justice Sanderson of the Superior Court of Justice restored
    Morris as a 50 percent shareholder of IWS and awarded damages to Morris against
    Chester, IWS and Chester’s sons – such damages to be determined on a reference
    to a Master.  Sanderson J. also awarded SWR, a company controlled by Morris’s
    sons, damages of $2.6 million against Chester, Chester’s son, Robert, and
    IWS plus interest accruing from 1989.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sanderson
    J.’s judgment was appealed to this court by Chester and his sons.  The appeal
    was dismissed except in respect of minor issues.  Leave to appeal to the
    Supreme Court of Canada was denied as was a subsequent motion to reconsider
    the leave application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately,
    the litigation between the brothers and their families did not end with the
    denial of leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.  There remained
    outstanding the reference to the Master in respect of damages.  Also, Morris
    commenced an oppression application against Chester, his sons and others
    in relation to the management of IWS.  The oppression case was case managed
    by the motion judge who was also appointed under rule 37.15 to hear all motions
    and applications in Waxman related litigation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a result of a concern to preserve the assets that would be available to satisfy
    the judgment of Sanderson J., obtained by Morris and others, Farley J. issued
    an order in the oppression case on November 3, 2004 to the effect that all
    of the assets of Chester and his two sons be frozen except for $100,000 per
    month that was to be paid to Chester and his sons for their employment with
    IWS.  Counsel for Morris, in a letter to the motion judge dated November
    9, 2004, agreed that the freezing order was not in any way to effect Chester’s
    ability to pay legal bills. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    provision for the payment of legal fees was included in a subsequent order
    of the motion judge dated March 2, 2005.  The March order provided for a
    payment protocol for legal fees which involved a review by a court appointed
    monitor.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Final
    judgment in the oppression case was delivered on September 1, 2005.  The
    motion judge converted a number of interlocutory orders into final orders
    including the November 3, 2004 freezing order and the legal fees payment
    protocol.  Paragraph 3(c) of the September 1, 2005 order provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Chester, Warren, Robert and Bailey may use any
    of the funds frozen pursuant to the Order of this Court dated November 3,
    2004 (the “Frozen Funds”), or any of their non-frozen funds, to pay for any
    legal fees and disbursements, including relevant and necessary expert, accounting
    or consulting fees, for proceedings 02-CL-4794, 33234/88, 37616/89 and 05-CL-5881
    (including appeals) (the “Fee Payments”).  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    indicated above, counsel for SWR (who was also Morris’s counsel) by <i>ex
    parte</i> application to the Registrar of the Court, obtained the notices
    of garnishment on November 4, 2005.  Counsel for Chester moved before the
    motion judge on December 13, 2005 to vacate the notices of garnishment.  Counsel
    also moved for an order directing that Chester may, on terms similar to the
    payment protocol set out in the orders of March 2 and September 1, 2005,
    pay outstanding receivables and further legal and professional fees in respect
    of ongoing litigation with Morris from the accounts at the Banks and/or the
    Chester Investments loan to IWS and/or Chester’s shareholding loan/drawing
    account with IWS.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    reserving his decision, the motion judge on December 23, 2005 ordered that
    the notices of garnishment issued to SWR in respect of Chester’s bank accounts
    were to be vacated, but only to the extent necessary to fund certain payments:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i) repayment by Chester to IWS of legal fees relating
    to the appeal of Justice Sanderson’s trial judgment; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii) payment of reasonable legal fees for Chester
    for the reference to a maximum of $250,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge also ordered that to the extent that the funds in the bank accounts
    were insufficient to satisfy the above payments, the Chesterton loan account
    at IWS could be utilized, subject to Chester agreeing to reimburse such amounts
    found not owing to Chester.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the appellants attack the order of the motion judge on several grounds.  The
    main thrust of the appellants’ position is that the notices of garnishment
    are in conflict with the motion judge’s freezing orders of November 3, 2004,
    March 2, 2005 and September 1, 2005.  Counsel submits that the September
    1 consolidating order provides that all of the monies held in Chester’s accounts
    at the Banks, except for the $100,000 monthly payment and the payment of
    legal fees, are frozen and are not to be transferred or encumbered.  Encumbering
    those funds through the notices of garnishment is contrary to the express
    terms of the September 1 freezing order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    effect of the garnishment notices, as far as Chester and his family are concerned,
    is that they prohibit access to the bank accounts for the payment of their
    legal fees in accordance with the payment protocol except to the extent of
    $250,000 which sum is insufficient to cover their needs.  Counsel for the
    appellants submits that the motion judge’s order of December 23 is tantamount
    to a variation of the September 1, 2005 order without any variation application
    having been brought.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the appellants also submits that the notices were issued just weeks short
    of the commencement of the reference before the Master and three days before
    an attendance on the Master to deal with the scheduling of the reference.  The
    Master and counsel for Chester were not advised of the notices of garnishment
    at the scheduling motion.  There was no change in circumstances following
    the September 1 order which would justify the motion judge varying the legal
    fees exception to that order.  No effort was made on behalf of SWR to enforce
    its judgment from the time of the dismissal of the appeal to this Court.  There
    is a suggestion of ulterior motive on the part of the respondents.  There
    is, at least, an inference that could be drawn that the issuance of the notices
    of garnishment, virtually on the eve of the reference to the Master, was
    a stratagem to achieve some tactical advantage.  Indeed, Justice Farley makes
    a passing reference in his reasons for judgment when he refers to “the rather
    sudden issuance of the garnishments”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the respondents submits that the order of December 23, 2005 has to be
    read in the context of the litigation battle that has been waged between
    the two brothers and their families since 1988.  He emphasizes, in particular,
    that after the judgment of Justice Sanderson, Chester continued to drain
    funds from IWS and that Chester and his son Robert have done everything within
    their power to avoid accepting the judgment of Justice Sanderson.  Counsel
    alleges that attempts to examine Robert as a judgment debtor in reference
    to the judgment in favour of SWR have been frustrated and that this led to
    the application for the notices of garnishment.  Counsel for the respondents
    relies on the motion judge’s endorsement of December 23, 2005 where he describes
    the purpose of his freezing orders:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The general purpose of the freezing orders were
    [<i>sic</i>] to prevent the incredible and continued leakage of assets from
    Chester, which assets would in all likelihood be required (not for expenses
    and disbursements in the ordinary course) but rather to fund Chester’s obligations
    to Morris as determined by the foregoing court decision of Sanderson J.,
    whether or not the reference determined a further damage liability of any
    magnitude.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the respondents, during the course of oral argument, repeated several
    times that there was nothing in the freezing orders which prohibited the
    issuance of the notices of garnishment and that they were perfectly entitled
    to proceed with them.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, I cannot accept the respondents’
    submission.  Paragraph 3(b) of the September 1, 2005 order provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>All of the assets of Chester, Robert and Warren
    are frozen<i> and shall not be assigned, transferred or otherwise encumbered</i> <i>except
    by further order of the Court</i>, save and except that these freezing orders
    do not apply to the use by Chester, Warren and Gary of the money they receive
    out of the $100,000 monthly funds from IWS (referred to in paragraph 1(d),
    above); the reasonable needs of Robert are to be dealt with in a similar
    fashion, based upon agreement by all counsel or further order of the Court,
    which should be structured so as not to precipitate a seizure of assets by
    any secured creditor.  (Emphasis added)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paragraph
    3(c) of the order has already been referred to above which provides access
    to Chester, Warren, Robert and Bailey to the funds for the payment of legal
    fees and disbursements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the September 1, 2005 order is unequivocal that the bank accounts
    (the assets of Chester) cannot be encumbered except by further order of the
    court.  In order to achieve the objectives sought by the respondents, it
    was necessary for them to bring an application to vary the September order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the respondents argues that as case management judge and a judge acting
    under rule 60.08(16) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, the motion judge
    had a broad discretion to make whatever order he considers just in the particular
    circumstances of this case.  Subrule 60.08(16) provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Garnishment Hearing</i> – on motion by a creditor,
    debtor, garnishee, co-owner of the debt or any other interested person, the
    court may,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) where it is alleged that the debt of the garnishee
    to the debtor has been assigned or encumbered, order the assignee or encumbrancer
    to appear and state the nature and particulars of his or her claim;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) determine the rights and liabilities of the
    garnishee, the debtor, co-owner of the debt and any assignee or encumbrancer;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c) vary or suspend periodic payments under a notice
    of garnishment; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(d) determine any other matter in relation to a
    notice of garnishment, </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>and the court may proceed in a summary manner,
    but where the motion is made to a master and raises a genuine issue of fact
    or of law, it shall be adjourned to be heard by a judge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents rely upon the judgment of this court in <i>International Union
    of Painters and Allied Trades, Local 200 v. S &amp; S Glass and Aluminum
    (1993) Ltd.</i> (2004), 47 C.P.C. (5th) 266 (Ont. C.A.) in respect of the
    approach to be taken to subrule 60.08(16).  The aforesaid case related to
    the validity of two notices of garnishment in which the debtor was identified
    by some, but not all, of his various names.  The garnishee took the position
    that it did not owe money to the debtors named in the notices of garnishment.  Gillese
    J.A. observed that the debtors in the action were, in reality, one person.  In
    upholding the validity of the second notice of garnishment, Gillese J.A.
    said at paragraphs 18, 19, 20, 21 and 27:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[18] There are times when technical arguments,
    such as the one proffered by Seaway in this case, must carry the day.  This
    is not one of those times.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[19] I begin by considering the language of subrule
    60.08(16).  There is nothing in its wording to support the restrictive approach
    advocated by Seaway.  In fact, the language used in subrule 60.08(16) supports
    the contrary view. “Any…interested person” may bring a motion pursuant to
    the subrule; the court “may” determine the “rights and liabilities of the
    garnishee” or “any other matter” in relation to a notice of garnishment.  It “may” proceed
    in a summary manner.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[20] The subrule was recently considered in <i>20
      Toronto Street Holdings Ltd. v. Coffee, Tea or Me Bakeries Inc.</i> (2001),
      53 O.R. (3d) 360 (Ont. S.C.J.).  Justice Nordheimer said this, at para.
      5: “as suggested by the use of the word ‘may’ in subrule 60.08(16) above,
      the court may therefore make whatever order it deems just in the particular
      circumstances of any given case.”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[21] In my view, on a plain reading of rule 60.08(16),
    the motions judge had the power, when determining Seaway’s “rights and liabilities”,
    to look at the realities of the relationship of the various Skov companies
    and the conduct of Skov toward Local 200, as those realities were know[n]
    to Seaway, when it received the garnishee.  Those realities fully justified
    the order.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[27] Nothing in the subrule or in the case law
    decided on its application supports the proposition that the courts should
    take an unduly technical approach when satisfied that adequate notice has
    been given to the affected party.  The subrule has been applied in an equitable
    manner: see <i>Hongkong Bank of Canada v. Slesers</i> (1992), 7 O.R. (3d)
    117 (Ont. Gen. Div.), at 120; <i>Metropolitan Toronto (Municipality) v. O’Brien</i>,
    [1995] O.J. No. 4896 (Ont. Gen. Div.) at para. 19.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I,
    of course, agree with Gillese J.A.’s observations on the approach to be taken
    to subrule 60.08(16).  It was obviously appropriate to take that approach
    in the <i>S &amp; S Glass &amp; Aluminum</i> case.  However, the situation
    before us in the case at bar is quite different.  While it is not difficult,
    on this record, to have a high degree of empathy for the plight that the
    respondents find themselves in and while it can be said that the motion judge
    proceeded on a pragmatic basis, I cannot find any legal justification upon
    which to support the notices of garnishment.  By ignoring the express requirement
    contained in paragraph 3(b) of the Order, the respondents have simply short-circuited
    the process that the motion judge established. </p>

    decision of Farley J., and in doing so I conclude that the appeal must be

    to the family company, I. Waxman &amp; Sons Limited (“IWS”), which Morris
    Waxman and the appellant each own on a 50:50 basis.  This amount represented
    personal legal fees of Chester and his sons, which Chester had improperly
    caused IWS to pay.  Chester was permitted under the challenged order to employ
    funds in the garnished accounts for the purpose of fulfilling this repayment
    condition. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,

    the issues as framed in the notice of motion, as he was obliged to do.  The
    appellant’s arguments may be distilled into two basic submissions, namely:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1. The circumstances in which the garnishments
    were sought and obtained by SWR with Morris’s consent amount to an abuse
    of process; and/ or,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2. Given the nature of the motion before him, Farley
    J. could not have granted the relief he ordered.  That is, Farley J. effectively

    J’s discretionary order was within his jurisdiction and involved no error
    in law or principle.  The order in respect of the garnishments was fully
    authorized by subrule 60.08(16).  There was no reason why the garnishments
    should have been wholly set aside, as sought by Chester.  They were issued
    by a judgment creditor against a judgment debtor to collect on a valid judgment
    that had already been upheld by this Court.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    accede to Chester’s argument would mean that a judgment creditor, having
    protected its judgment by obtaining a court order prohibiting the judgment
    debtor from dissipating its assets, creates a bar to the judgment creditor
    taking any further steps to enforce its judgment.  In this case it would
    mean that Chester is free to litigate exhaustively in an effort to frustrate
    or avoid Morris’s judgment, while Morris is prohibited from taking otherwise
    lawful steps to enforce his judgment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Such
    a result in this case would be unfair, unbalanced and unreasonable.  It seems
    to me that this is precisely the analysis that Farley J. undertook and decided,
    in the context of his intimate knowledge of this long and complex litigation,
    should not be allowed to occur. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is important to appreciate that any freezing orders made against Chester
    were made in an effort to protect Morris’s ability to realize on his judgment.  They
    were granted for purposes of allowing for enforcement of the judgment, not
    to shelter Chester’s assets until he has exhausted his litigation options. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
    Farley J. did was to uphold the validity of the garnishments while permitting
    Chester to access a specified amount of cash from the garnished accounts
    in order to prevent a scheduled reference proceeding from being derailed
    or delayed.  This was a practical and functional approach by an experienced
    commercial judge who was, and had been, case managing the multitude of litigation
    between the parties.  Moreover, I think it was entirely appropriate that
    Chester - as a precondition - be required to first comply with the outstanding
    legal fees repayment order, which he had ignored. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    Farley J. permitted Chester to employ the Chesterton loan account as a backstop,
    in the event that there were insufficient funds in the garnished accounts
    to cover the legal fee repayment obligation and the $250,000 sum freed up
    for legal fees on the damages reference.  This backstop element of his order
    was authorized by paragraph 1(q) of the previous final judgment in the oppression
    case, which enjoined IWS payments to Chesterton under the loan account “until
    further order of this Court”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, the order of Farley J. was a proper exercise of his judicial
    discretion.  Additionally, while the approach taken by SWR, with the consent
    of Morris, in obtaining the garnishment orders might be considered by some
    as
    “hardball” litigation, it was nevertheless completely lawful.  In the circumstances
    of this case, it falls far short of amounting to an abuse of process.</p>
