    to s. 5(1) of the <i>Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</i>, S.C. 1996, c. 19

'>An offence for small quantities of marijuana (specified in
    Schedule VII to be less that three kilograms) under s. 5(4) falls within the
    “absolute” jurisdiction of a provincial court judge pursuant to s. 553(c)(xi)

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the matter was called for trial in the Ontario Court of
    Justice, the trial judge asked Crown counsel to clarify the issue of
    jurisdiction. Crown counsel withdrew one count that would have given the
    appellants an election as to how they should be tried and proceeded only on the
    five counts that were said to involve less than three kilograms of marijuana.
    Crown counsel stated that as he would only attempt to prove less than three
    kilograms of marijuana on each of the counts, the matter fell within the
    absolute jurisdiction of the provincial court. The appellants took the position
    that they were not prepared for trial and that the matter should proceed as a
    preliminary hearing. The trial judge rejected the appellants’ contention and,
    on the basis of Crown counsel’s statement as to the quantity of drugs at issue,
    ruled that the charges fell within his absolute jurisdiction pursuant to s.
    553(c)(xi). He ordered that the matter should proceed as a trial within the
    absolute jurisdiction of the provincial court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After several days of trial but before the Crown closed its
    case and before the appellants were put to their defence, the appellants
    applied for <i>mandamus</i> and prohibition in the Superior Court of Justice
    alleging that as the information failed to specify the quantity of marijuana
    trafficked, a provincial court judge had no jurisdiction to proceed with the
    trial. That application was dismissed by Borkovich J. who held that the Ontario
    Court of Justice did have jurisdiction to try the charges. The appellants filed
    a notice of appeal from that order. Before the appeal was heard, the trial
    judge, acting on his own motion, reopened the question of jurisdiction. Citing <i>R.
    v. Sewell</i> (2003), 175 C.C.C. (3d) 242 (Sask. C.A.), the trial judge held
    that as the information failed to specify that the quantity of drugs was less
    than three kilograms, the appellants should have been put to their election and
    that the court had “exceeded its jurisdiction by proceeding to trial”. Crown
    counsel offered to amend the information to specify the quantity of drugs at
    issue but the provincial court judge refused to entertain that request and
    instead made an order that the trial proceed as a preliminary inquiry pursuant
    to s. 555(1). The trial judge further ruled that by operation of s. 565(1)(a),
    the accused were deemed to have elected trial by a court composed of a judge
    and jury. At the conclusion of the evidence, the appellants were committed for
    trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants submit that as the trial judge ruled that the
    court had “exceeded its jurisdiction by proceeding to trial”, the proceedings
    before him were a complete nullity and consequently, that he lacked
    jurisdiction to make an order converting the trial into a preliminary inquiry.
    The appellants submit, accordingly, that the application judge erred by
    refusing to grant <i>certiorari</i> to quash the s. 555(1) order and the
    committal for trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are unable to accept the appellant’s submission. In our
    view, s. 555(1) provides a complete answer to the appellants’ contention.
    Section 555(1) provides as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Where
    in any proceedings under this Part an accused is before a provincial court
    judge and it appears to the provincial court judge that for any reason the
    charge should be prosecuted by indictment, he may, at any time before the
    accused has entered upon his defence, decide not to adjudicate and shall
    thereupon inform the accused of his decision and continue the proceedings as a
    preliminary inquiry.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All the requirements of that section were met: the proceedings
    were under Part XIX, it appeared to the trial judge that the charge should be
    prosecuted by indictment to remove any question as to jurisdiction, and the
    accused had not entered their defence. The fact that the offence was within the
    “absolute” jurisdiction of the provincial court does not oust the jurisdiction
    of the Superior Court to try the appellants and did not preclude the trial
    judge from converting the trial into a preliminary inquiry. The jurisdiction of
    the provincial court to try an indictable offence under s. 553 is absolute, but
    it is not exclusive. It is absolute in the sense that it does not depend upon
    the election of the accused. However, it is not exclusive as, pursuant to s.
    468, the Superior Court “has jurisdiction to try any indictable offence”, even
    those included in s. 553: see <i>R. v. Scherbank</i>, [1967] 2 C.C.C. 279 (Ont.
    C.A.), aff’g [1966] 4 C.C.C. 338 (Ont. H.C.); <i>R. v. Holliday</i> (1973), 12
    C.C.C. (2d) 56 (Alta. C.A.); <i>R. v. Coupland</i> (1978), 45 C.C.C. (2d) 437
    (Alta. C.A.).</p>

line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A s. 555(1) order may be made after the commencement of trial
    for an absolute jurisdiction offence: see <i>R. v. Cooper</i> (1955), 21 C.R.
    263 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. Christie</i> (2003), 57 W.C.B. (2d) 265 at paras.
    21-22 (Ont. S.C.J.); Edward L. Greenspan &amp; Marc Rosenberg, eds., <i>Martin’s
    Annual Criminal Code</i> <i>2007</i>, (Aurora, Ont.: Canada Law Book, 2006), at
    p. 1062: “This section deals with situations where a trial in the provincial
    court may be transformed into a preliminary inquiry, even where the accused has
    elected to be tried in that forum <i>or, by virtue of s. 553, the offence is
    within the absolute jurisdiction of the provincial court judge</i>” [Emphasis
    added.]; R.E. Salhany, <i>Canadian Criminal Procedure</i>, 6th ed., looseleaf

    a nullity on the ground that the information failed to specify either the
    quantity of drugs at issue or the section of the <i>Controlled Drugs and Substances
    Act</i> under which the charges were brought. That deficiency may constitute a
    valid ground for appeal after trial on such an information or indictment as in <i>R.
    v. Sewell</i>, <i>supra</i> at para. 55, as the deficiency could have deprived
    the accused of an election.  However, we
    do not agree that the defect in the information in the present case rendered
    the proceedings a complete nullity and void <i>ab initio</i>. The information
    could have been amended to repair the deficiency: see s. 601(2)(b). In <i>R. v.
    Sewell</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 52, the case relied upon as authority for
    the proposition that a defect of this nature results in a loss of jurisdiction,
    one count was amended and the conviction on that count survived on appeal.
    Moreover, the appellants sought a preliminary hearing and that is what they
    have been given. We see no procedural denial comparable to what occurred in <i>R.
    v. Sewell, supra</i>. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While it would have been preferable to have permitted the
    Crown to amend the information, it was open to the trial judge in the circumstances
    of this case to exercise his discretion under s. 555(1) to convert the trial
    into a preliminary inquiry. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not agree that the s. 555(1) order prejudiced the
