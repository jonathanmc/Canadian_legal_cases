  <p><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>On appeal from

  <p class=headingtitle>SIMMONS and ROULEAU JJ.A.:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1983, Philip Andrew Edgar was found not guilty of
    second-degree murder by reason of insanity. On October 19, 2005, the Ontario
    Review Board granted Mr. Edgar an absolute discharge based on findings that “at
    best [Mr. Edgar poses] a small or miniscule risk of great harm of a criminal
    nature to the public” and “there is no evidence of a high risk of trivial harm.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Robert McDonnell, the person in charge of Providence
    Continuing Care Centre, Mental Health Services, appeals from the Board’s
    disposition. In essence, the appellant contends that the Board’s finding that
    Mr. Edgar no longer poses a significant threat to the public is unreasonable.
    In addition, the appellant contends that the Board gave insufficient reasons
    for its finding and that the Board failed to discharge its duty to inquire into
    all relevant evidence. Further, the appellant seeks to introduce fresh evidence
    on appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Attorney-General for Ontario supports the appellant’s
    position.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, we would allow the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Background</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On August 9, 1983, Mr. Edgar bludgeoned a female friend to
    death and, after he killed her, mutilated her body in a sexually sadistic way.
    Specifically, following the victim’s death, Mr. Edgar tore a hole in her body
    between her vagina and anus and inserted a hammer into the hole he had created.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On December 20, 1983, Mr. Edgar was found not guilty of second-degree
    murder by reason of insanity. At the time, he had no prior criminal convictions
    and no history of psychiatric illness. Subsequent to the finding, Mr. Edgar has
    been diagnosed as suffering from dysthymia, personality disorder-mixed and
    sexual sadism. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since the murder, Mr. Edgar has been in no trouble. Moreover,
    during the eleven-year period preceding the Board’s most recent disposition, he
    lived in the community subject to hospital supervision; and, during the last
    three years of that period he has been on a conditional discharge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the most recent Board hearing both the appellant and the
    Attorney-General submitted that Mr. Edgar continues to pose a significant risk
    to the public. In so doing, they relied on evidence to that effect from Dr. Chan,
    Mr. Edgar’s attending psychiatrist, as well as evidence contained in the
    hospital report that was filed as an exhibit at the hearing. The evidence of
    risk consisted of three main components.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, Mr. Edgar’s scores on the Violence Risk Appraisal Guide
    (VRAG) rate him as a moderate risk of re-offending with violence. Specifically,
    Mr. Edgar’s scores indicate that he resembles a group of mentally disordered
    accused of whom 17% will re-offend violently within seven years of opportunity
    and 31% will re-offend violently within a ten-year timeframe.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the appellant and the Attorney-General contend that
    dynamic risk factors relating to Mr. Edgar, including factors surveyed on the
    HCR-20, demonstrate significant risk. These include: i) the lifelong nature of
    Mr. Edgar’s diagnosed conditions; ii) outstanding questions concerning whether
    Mr. Edgar has adequate insight into the relapse path arising from his
    difficulty in fully appreciating the sexual element of the index offence; iii)
    uncertainty about whether Mr. Edgar would be able and motivated to be
    forthcoming with information that might indicate movement towards relapse; iv)
    the potential for his dysthymic mood to worsen and the requirement that he
    maintain a course of treatment on low dose anti-depressant medication; v)
    concerns on the part of the treatment team that Mr. Edgar would not follow-up
    with psychiatric treatment if discharged absolutely; vi) the potential for
    exposure to destabilizers including a significantly invested sexual or romantic
    relationship and resumption of alcohol consumption; and vii) the potential for
    a return of sadistic fantasies or impulses.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the appellant and the Attorney-General contend that the
    ongoing inability of forensic professionals to find a satisfactory explanation
    for what led to the index offence indicates ongoing significant risk. In
    particular, they rely on Dr. Chan’s statement in his oral evidence that “it’s a
    rule in forensics” that one must understand the index offence in order to be
    best equipped to manage the risk posed by an offender.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a section entitled “Risk Management”, the hospital report
    concluded that aftercare and a stable mood were important to minimizing the
    risk of re-offence. The hospital report also recommended reinstitution of a
    condition restricting the use of alcohol, drugs or other intoxicants because of
    a question concerning whether alcohol might contribute to the re-emergence of
    sadistic fantasies and cause behavioural disinhibition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>The Board’s Reasons</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In its reasons, the Board referred to the circumstances of the
    index offence and Mr. Edgar’s diagnosis and current circumstances. The Board
    then reviewed the evidence of Dr. Chan. In doing so, the Board noted that Mr.
    Edgar’s VRAG score places him in the fourth lowest of the nine categories of
    risk to re-offend. Further, the Board stated, “The dynamic risk factors as
    surveyed on the HCR-20 tests as reviewed with Dr. Chan by Board member Dr.
    Webster scores virtually zero.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board also referred to Dr. Chan’s response to a question
    from a Board member about what it would take for Mr. Edgar to obtain an
    absolute discharge. The Board stated:</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>His response was that the accused
    could do no better than what he is now doing. He stated that the only reason an
    absolute discharge is not supported by the hospital is concern about the
    mystery surrounding why the index offence took place.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before leaving Dr. Chan’s evidence, the Board said:</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>In the past year there really has
    been no change in the accused’s situation from the prior year and some years
    past. … Over the years, emphasis has been placed by the accused’s treating
    psychiatrist on obtaining from the accused a recognition that the index offence
    contained a much greater sexual component than the accused has been prepared to
    concede. This has never come to pass and indeed since Dr Chan took over the
    accused’s care in May 2002 he has concluded that there were a number of factors
    which brought about the index offence. Of significance is Dr. Chan’s evidence
    that in the absence of a Review Board order the worst thing that could happen
    would happen with a similar combination of influences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board then turned to its analysis. At the outset, the
    Board stated that after taking the matters it had reviewed into consideration
    along with “the accused’s consistent and favourable management and behaviour,
    this year’s Review Board panel is compelled to take a fresh look a Mr. Edgar’s
    status.” While acknowledging that the hospital had raised legitimate concerns
    relating to the absence of a satisfactory psychiatric explanation for the
    offence, the severity of the offence, and the lifelong nature of Mr. Edgar’s
    diagnosed conditions, the Board stated that “considerable weight” had to be
    given “to the conduct and history of the accused for the past twenty-two
    years.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, the Board wrote, </p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>Particular attention must be paid
    to the last eleven years while he has been living in the community. If there
    was an opportunity or propensity for the accused’s fantasies to be demonstrated
    or brought to the attention of trained personnel in the hospital system, surely
    that would have been observed in the past twenty-two years.…Dr. Chan does not
    believe that alcohol is a significant risk factor and of importance, he would
    be confident that Mr. Edgar will continue his relationship with the hospital
    even if on an absolute discharge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the Board noted the following factors: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr. Chan expressed the opinion that it was a confluence
    of factors that likely brought about the index offence and that it would be a
    confluence of factors that might cause it to repeat in the future;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Edgar testified that even if he would not continue
    the therapeutic relationship with the specific personnel at the hospital he
    would continue a relationship with psychiatrists in the community;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Edgar had had the opportunity to consume alcohol
    for two years and reported that he had not done so; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Edgar had a reasonably solid therapeutic
    relationship with Dr. Chan who is confident that on a discharge Mr. Edgar would
    maintain communication with the hospital team; and </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Edgar’s lifestyle “remains simple and stable and
    satisfactory to him.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After reviewing the foregoing matters, the Board concluded,
    “there is at best a small or miniscule risk of great harm of a criminal nature
    to the public”, no high risk of trivial harm, and that in these circumstances,
    it was obliged to grant an absolute discharge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Analysis</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We begin our analysis by noting that this Court may set aside
    a Board disposition only where it is of the opinion that:</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>i.            the Board disposition is
    unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence;</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>ii.            the Board disposition is based on an
    error in law (unless no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has
    occurred); or</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE> iii.            there has been a miscarriage of
    justice.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the first branch of this test involves application of a
    standard of review of reasonableness<i> simpliciter</i>, the second branch
    involves application of a standard of correctness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We have divided our analysis into two parts.  The first addresses the grounds of appeal in
    the absence of the fresh evidence that is, based on the record as it was before
    the Board.  The second part deals with
    the impact of the fresh evidence.  As we
    will explain, absent the fresh evidence, we would have dismissed the appeal.</p>
  <h3>&nbsp; </h3>
  <h3>a)            <u>Consideration of the
    grounds of appeal in the absence of the fresh evidence</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s first and second grounds of appeal are to some
    extent interrelated, <i>i.e.</i> the appellant’s submissions that the Board’s
    finding that Mr. Edgar no longer poses a significant threat to the public is
    unreasonable and that the Board failed to give sufficient reasons for its
    findings. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In particular, the appellant submits that, in the face of its
    comments that nothing had really changed in the past year (or for several
    years), the Board failed to provide any tenable explanations for several
    matters: i) why Mr. Edgar no longer poses a significant threat to the community
    whereas previous Boards found that he did; ii) the basis on which it departed
    from the most accurate predictive tool of risk, namely Mr. Edgar’s VRAG scores;
    and iii) why the rule in forensics that it is necessary to understand the index
    offence to be best equipped to manage risk should be departed from in this
    case. In the absence of such explanations, the appellant contends that the
    Board’s findings are unreasonable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the appellant contends that the Board appears to have
    acted based on the mistaken view that Dr. Chan’s response to a Board member
    that Mr. Edgar “could do no better than what he is now doing” indicated that he
    should be given an absolute discharge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellant submits that in the face of Mr. Edgar’s
    evidence that he would not necessarily maintain his therapeutic relationship
    with the hospital, but might instead seek psychiatric care in the community, and
    Dr. Chan’s evidence that it is difficult to find a psychiatrist with the
    requisite forensic expertise, the Board’s decision to grant an absolute
    discharge without investigating the actual support services available to Mr.
    Edgar in the community was unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support of the appellant’s submissions, the
    Attorney-General contends that the Board relied unduly on Mr. Edgar’s history
    of good behaviour while ignoring the significance of his VRAG scores; that the
    Board’s finding that Mr. Edgar’s HCR-20 dynamic risk test scores were virtually
    zero was unreasonable; and that the Board ignored Dr. Chan’s evidence that
    there were in fact further steps that Mr. Edgar could take in order to obtain
    an absolute discharge namely, reassure the hospital staff that, if discharged
    absolutely, he would continue with his therapeutic program.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept these submissions. In our view, it is clear
    from the Board’s reasons that, while it was aware of Mr. Edgar’s VRAG scores
    and the importance of understanding what led to the index offence for the
    purpose of managing risk, it was satisfied, based on its view of the dynamic
    risk factors, Mr. Edgar’s longstanding good behaviour, and Dr. Chan’s evidence
    of the confluence of factors that would be necessary to cause Mr. Edgar to
    re-offend, that Mr. Edgar’s risk of violent re-offending was minimal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While it may have been preferable for the Board to have
    referred explicitly to the evidence that actuarial risk assessment tools are
    the most accurate predictive tools and that caution should be exercised before
    departing from their assessments based on clinical judgment, we are not
    persuaded that the Board ignored that evidence. Rather, in our view, it is
    clear from its reasons that the Board concluded that the evidence relating to
    Mr. Edgar’s history of good conduct, his present circumstances, Dr. Chan’s
    confidence that Mr. Edgar would continue his relationship with the hospital and
    Dr. Chan’s evidence concerning what could cause Mr. Edgar to re-offend,
    outweighed the evidence indicating a potential for risk. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board’s findings in relation to risk assessment attract
    considerable deference from this court, particularly because of the Board’s
    expertise in relation to the issues and evidence before it: <i>R. v. Owen</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at para. 29; <i>R. v. Vancurenko</i>, [2006] O.J. No. 2569 (C.A.). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On our review of the record, there was no detailed evidence
    concerning the nature of VRAG testing or any circumstances that might affect
    its predictive validity. In particular, there was no evidence concerning
    whether longstanding good conduct, as opposed to clinical judgment, can
    properly outweigh the predictive validity of a VRAG score. In the absence of
    such evidence and in light of the deference to which the Board’s findings are
    entitled, we see no basis for holding that the Board’s implicit conclusions
    concerning the significance of the appellant’s VRAG score or the absence of a
    complete understanding of what led to the index offence were unreasonable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, we are not persuaded that the Board made any error in
    its assessment of the evidence relating to Mr. Edgar’s HCR-20 dynamic risk
    factors. In questioning Dr. Chan in relation to this issue, Board member Dr.
    Webster made it clear that he understood that Dr. Chan had not assigned scores
    to the various factors and that scoring was not required. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, Dr. Webster did note that scoring was recommended in
    the manual. In that context, he asked Dr. Chan to give him “a slightly clearer
    idea of where the risks actually are”, and requested that Dr. Chan assess the
    factors based on a “yes, no or maybe.” On our review of Dr. Chan’s responses,
    we see no basis for holding that the Board misapprehended Dr. Chan’s evidence
    or that its conclusion was unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, it is also clear that the 2005 Board took a
    different view from that of the 2004 Board of the likelihood that Mr. Edgar was
    continuing to experience violent fantasies.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, contrary to the appellant’s submissions, we do
    not read the Board’s reasons as indicating that it considered that Mr. Edgar
    should be given an absolute discharge because of Dr. Chan’s statement that Mr.
    Edgar “could do no better than what he is now doing.” Rather, in our view, Dr.
    Chan’s statement was simply a factor that the Board took into account in
    assessing Mr. Edgar’s situation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, while we agree that it would have been open to the
    Board to further investigate the availability of alternate psychiatric care for
    Mr. Edgar in the community, we are not persuaded that, without the benefit of
    the fresh evidence, the Board’s failure to do so renders its disposition
    unreasonable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Viewed as a whole, in our opinion, the reasons for the Board’s
    findings concerning Mr. Edgar’s level of risk are apparent. While we consider
    that it may have been open to the Board to reach a different conclusion, we are
    not persuaded that, on the record before it, its findings are unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning to the appellant’s submission that the Board failed to
    discharge its duty to inquire into all relevant evidence, the appellant
    contends that the Board erred in law by failing to seek out two documents that
    would have provided important evidence concerning Mr. Edgar’s level of risk. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The two documents are: i) a clinical summary dated October 1,
    1998 prepared by Dr. James Hillen, which was listed as an attachment to the
    hospital report and which was not in fact attached; and ii) a note dated
    September 24, 1999 prepared by Dr. James Hillen, which was described in oral
    evidence and in the hospital report as providing the best description of the
    index offence.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that because the annual Board process
    is an inquisitorial process as opposed to an adversarial process, the Board had
    a duty to seek out and review these items. Particularly because of its duty to
    examine the circumstances of the offence in assessing the risk posed by an
    offender, the appellant submits that the Board was obliged to obtain and review
    Dr. Hillen’s September 24, 1999 note. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, the 2004 Board listed these two documents as
    being amongst a series of six documents that it had reviewed and which it
    described as being “very helpful”. Particularly in light of the 2004 Board’s
    description, the appellant submits that the failure of the 2005 Board to obtain
    these documents was an error in law that mandates a new hearing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept these submissions.  We  have reviewed the
    documents in issue as part of considering the appellant’s fresh evidence
    application. Based on this review and the reasons of the Board, we are not
    persuaded that there is any realistic possibility that these documents would
    have affected the Board’s decision had they been filed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As already noted, in its reasons, the Board concluded that the
    evidence relating to Mr. Edgar’s history of good conduct, his present
    circumstances, Dr. Chan’s confidence that Mr. Edgar would continue his
    relationship with the hospital and Dr. Chan’s evidence concerning what could
    cause Mr. Edgar to re-offend, outweighed the evidence indicating a potential
    for risk. The factors indicating a potential for risk were fully detailed in
    the hospital report and in Dr. Chan’s evidence. In our view, there is no
    realistic possibility that the information included in Dr. Hillen’s October 1,
    1998 clinical summary would have affected the Board’s assessment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the summary of the index offence set out in Dr.
    Hillen’s September 24, 1999 note, the Board was well aware that over the years
    various physicians had been unable to fully explain what led to the index
    offence; that Dr. Chan had stated that it is a rule in forensics that it is
    necessary to understand the index offence in order to be best equipped to
    manage risk; and that Dr. Chan had drawn some conclusions concerning a
    confluence of factors that led to the index offence. Given the information and
    evidence that the Board actually had, we see no realistic possibility that Dr.
    Hillen’s September 24, 1999 note would have affected the Board’s conclusions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Particularly because the documents in issue were referred to
    in the evidence that was before the Board, we agree that it would have been
    preferable had counsel and the Board ensured that the documents were filed.
    However, having reviewed the documents, we are not satisfied that the Board’s
    failure to obtain and review them is a legal error requiring a new hearing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As part of its submissions relating to the failure of the
    Board to give adequate reasons, the appellant raised an issue concerning the
    actions of the Board in receiving additional documentary evidence after the
    oral hearing ended. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During the oral hearing, Mr. Edgar was questioned by the Board
    chair about the fact that it appeared he had not given any indication to Dr.
    Dickey of the Clarke Institute, shortly after committing the index offence, of
    being depressed or having any signs of depression at the time of the index
    offence. Mr. Edgar responded that, in fact, he had indicated to people at the
    Clarke Institute that he was severely depressed for over a year prior to the
    index offence; that this was confirmed in material produced by the Clarke
    Institute at his trial; and that the particular conversation with Dr. Dickey
    related to whether he was in an unusual state on the day of the index offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the conclusion of the oral hearing, the Board chair asked
    Dr. Chan for the original notes from the Clarke Institute and from Dr. Dickie.
    Following the hearing, a note from Dr. Dickie dated November 21, 1983 was
    produced to the Board. The appellant submits that the Board erred in law in
    receiving this note without providing the parties or the Board members with an opportunity
    to examine or cross-examine Dr. Chan in relation to it. In addition,
    particularly because the note does not support Mr. Edgar’s evidence, the
    appellant submits that the Board erred in law in failing to address the content
    of the note in its reasons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree. The request for additional documents was made on
    the record in the presence of all parties and Board members. If anyone present
    wished an opportunity to question Dr. Chan concerning the requested documents
    or even to reserve their rights in that regard, they could have said so. No
    such request was made; moreover, none of the parties objected to the notes
    being provided. Further, although the document that was produced did not
    support Mr. Edgar’s evidence, given his statement that there were other
    documents that did so, it did not serve to refute it. In these circumstances,
    we are not persuaded that the Board erred in law in receiving the note or in
    failing to refer to the contents of the note in its reasons.</p>
  <h3>&nbsp; </h3>
  <h3>b)        <u>The impact of the fresh
    evidence</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The final issue raised by the appellant is his application to
    adduce fresh evidence in the form of an affidavit from Dr. Chan concerning Mr.
    Edgar’s treatment following the Board’s disposition. In his affidavit, Dr. Chan
    states that after the Board’s disposition Mr. Edgar advised a member of the
    hospital’s outpatient nursing staff that “he no longer wanted to meet with [Dr.
    Chan] as [Dr. Chan is] associated with the Forensic Unit (although he would
    continue to see [Dr. Chan] if [Dr. Chan] had a private practice).”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, Dr. Chan deposes that Mr. Edgar permitted the
    outpatient nurse to visit him on December 20, 2005 and that Mr. Edgar informed
    the nurse during the visit that he is getting medication from his family doctor
    (who is not a psychiatrist).  Finally,
    Dr. Chan states, “To my knowledge, Mr. Edgar did not see a psychiatrist until
    after the Board’s disposition was appealed.” The effect of the appeal was to
    return Mr. Edgar to the jurisdiction of the Board and into Dr. Chan’s care.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that this evidence could reasonably
    have affected the Board’s decision. He submits that Dr. Chan’s opinion that Mr.
    Edgar would continue to see him was significant to the Board’s decision and
    that evidence of Mr. Edgar’s willingness to pursue psychiatric follow-up after
    an absolute discharge is important to evaluating Mr. Edgar’s level of risk.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for Mr. Edgar responds that the evidence is not
    admissible because it contains information concerning events that occurred
    following the Board’s disposition and which are therefore irrelevant to our
    review of the Board’s decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sections 672.73(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> provides that
    an appeal against a disposition order shall be “based on a transcript of the
    proceedings and any other evidence that the court of appeal finds necessary to
    admit in the interests of justice.” In <i>R. v. Owen</i>, <i>supra</i>, at paras. 48-61 and 71, the Supreme Court of Canada
    indicated that, in the context of an appeal of a disposition order under Part
    XX.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, fresh evidence concerning events that
    postdate the disposition order may be admitted where the evidence is
    “trustworthy and touches on the issue of risk to public safety.” In our view,
    Dr. Chan’s affidavit clearly meets those criteria. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Assuming that it remains
    necessary on an appeal of a disposition order under Part XX.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> that proposed fresh
    evidence meet the fourth <i>Palmer</i><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a> criterion for admissibility of fresh evidence in a criminal appeal (namely,
    that the evidence be such that if believed it could reasonably, when taken with
    the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected the result),
    we would,  for the reasons that follow,
    nonetheless admit Dr. Chan’s affidavit as fresh evidence on appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In its
    reasons, the Board clearly relied on Dr. Chan’s evidence to the effect that he
    did not think that Mr. Edgar would sever his relationship with the hospital
    team. The Board also referenced Mr. Edgar’s evidence that he might choose to
    seek out a community psychiatrist. The fresh evidence shows that, following his
    absolute discharge, Mr. Edgar severed his relationship with Dr. Chan. Further,
    by the date of the filing of the appeal, Mr. Edgar had not seen a psychiatrist
    in the community.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, this fresh evidence is important in at least two
    respects. First, it undermines a finding that was central to the Board’s
    reasoning. One of the bases for the Board’s departure from the results
    generated by the actuarial assessment tools was Dr. Chan’s confidence that Mr.
    Edgar would continue his relationship with the hospital. Maintaining this
    relationship provided assurance that Mr. Edgar would continue his therapeutic
    program, a program important in evaluating and controlling his risk.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the fresh evidence gives additional significance to
    the Board’s failure to further investigate the availability of alternate
    psychiatric care for Mr. Edgar in the community. Once Mr. Edgar determined that
    he would no longer see Dr. Chan, Mr. Edgar’s ability to continue his
    therapeutic program depended on both his willingness to avail himself of the
    services of a psychiatrist and the availability of suitable psychiatric care.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result, when the fresh evidence is considered in the
    context of the whole of the evidence presented at the original hearing and the
    Board’s reasons for its disposition, we are of the view that it might
    reasonably have affected the result and, for that reason, we would order a new
    hearing.</p>
  <h3>&nbsp; </h3>
  <h3>Disposition</h3>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>For the
