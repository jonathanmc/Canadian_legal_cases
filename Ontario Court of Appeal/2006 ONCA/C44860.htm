      is an appeal from an order striking various paragraphs from the appellants’
    statement of claim.  The respondents in this proceeding are three of the
    defendants; Blount Canada Ltd., Eugene Kraemer and Brenda Bower.  Mr. Kraemer
    and Ms. Bower work for Blount Canada Ltd.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Essentially,
      the claims sound in a wrongful dismissal allegation.  Jeff Kopperson, the
      main appellant, contends that he went to his employer, Blount Canada, with
      a delicate personal problem arising out of a sexual relationship he had
      been involved with involving another Blount employee.  Mr. Kopperson contends
      that Blount contrived to terminate his employment as a result of Mr. Kopperson’s
      initiation of this complaint and did not deal with him in good faith and
      in accordance with the company policies.  Mr. Kopperson points to Mr. Kraemer
      and Ms. Bower as the individuals he dealt with in connection with his complaint.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
      agree with counsel for the respondents that the pleadings are confusing
      and convoluted.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
      also agree with the motion judge that many of the causes of action referred
      to in the statement of claim were not properly pleaded.  Further, we agree
      that many of the specific pleadings do not comply with the basic rules
      governing the content of pleadings.    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
      are satisfied, however, that the statement of claim adequately, albeit
      inelegantly, advances a claim for the intentional infliction of mental
      suffering (see paras. 48-54 of the statement of claim).  This claim is
      adequately pleaded against Blount Canada as well as Mr. Kraemer and Ms.
      Bower in their personal capacities.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Blount
      Canada does not suggest that the wrongful dismissal claim should be struck.  It
      did, however, challenge many of the specific allegations in the claim relating
      to the wrongful dismissal allegation.  We agree and conclude that the wrongful
      dismissal claim is so badly drawn that it must be redrawn in its entirety
      to comply with the Rules of Civil Procedures and afford the defendants
      a proper opportunity to respond.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
      are satisfied that apart from the wrongful dismissal claim and the intentional
      infliction of mental distress claim, there are no other causes of action
      properly pleaded as against Blount Canada Ltd., Mr. Kraemer and Ms. Bower.  In
      so holding, we acknowledge that some of the facts pled by the appellants
      in relation to the other causes of action (e.g. the breach of confidence)
      may be germane to the wrongful dismissal claim or the intentional infliction
      of mental distress claim and, therefore, may properly find their way into
      a statement of claim dealing with those causes of action.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      statement of claim must be rewritten in its entirety.  We would grant leave
      to the appellants to serve and file an amended statement of claim.  As
      against Blount Canada Ltd., Mr. Kraemer and Ms. Bower, the appellants may
      advance claims for wrongful dismissal and the intentional infliction of
      mental distress.  They may not advance any of the other causes of action
      referred to in the present statement of claim.  It also goes without saying
      that the appellants must advance their claims in a manner that complies
      with the rules governing the content of pleadings.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There
      is another defendant, Angela Davis, the employee with whom Mr. Kopperson
      alleges he was having a sexual affair.  Ms. Davis did not take part in
      the motion to strike the pleadings or in this appeal.  She has served and
      filed a statement of defence to the claim as initially drawn.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      motion judge struck some of the causes of action asserted against Ms. Davis
      and several of the paragraphs containing allegations involving Ms. Davis.  She
      did so because, in her view, those claims were intertwined with the claims
      against the respondents that she concluded were improper and had to be
      struck.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
      Ms. Davis did not see fit to challenge the pleadings and indeed chose to
      defend those pleadings, we think the appellants are entitled to advance
      the same claims against Ms. Davis in their amended claim as they have advanced
      against her in the present claim.  Should the appellants choose to maintain
      some of the claims against Ms. Davis which we have held cannot be brought
      against the respondents, those claims must be pleaded in the amended statement
      of claim in a manner which makes it clear that the claims are discrete
      claims against Ms. Davis only and are not claims against the other respondents.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      motion judge also struck the derivative <i>Family Law Act</i> claims advanced
      on behalf of the appellants other than Mr. Kopperson.  In our view, the
      propriety of advancing <i>Family Law Act</i> derivative claims can only
      be properly assessed in the context of an amended statement of claim that
      properly alleges wrongful dismissal and intentional infliction of mental
      distress.  We see no value in evaluating the propriety of the <i>Family
      Law Act</i> claims in a pleading that must undergo substantial amendment
      if this matter is to proceed.  If the <i>Family Law Act</i> claims are
      advanced in the amended pleadings, the respondents may, if so advised,
      move to strike those pleadings.</span></p>

      appellants also seek leave to appeal two costs orders made by the motion
      judge.  The motion judge awarded costs on a substantial indemnity basis,
      despite the fact that the respondents had not sought substantial indemnity
      costs and the appellants had no opportunity to make submissions as to the
      appropriateness of costs on that scale.  The order for substantial indemnity
      costs cannot stand.  </span></p>

      are satisfied that the respondents were entitled to their costs on the
      motion.  Those costs should be on a partial indemnity basis.  We would
      fix costs of the motion and the subsequent proceedings arising out of the
      motion at $6,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST.  In keeping with
      the Rules, those costs should be payable forthwith.</span></p>

      accords with these reasons.  That claim shall be filed within thirty (30)
      days of September 27, 2006.  The defendants/respondents, Blount Canada
      Ltd., Eugene Kraemer and Brenda Bower shall have leave to file a defence
