      to 1990, the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (“OHIP”), which covers Ontario
      residents for medical and hospital insurance, was made available to Ontario
      residents upon payment of a prescribed premium.  In unionized workplaces,
      the parties could bargain for the employer to pay all or part of the premium
      on behalf of employees.  Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, many collective
      agreements in unionized workplaces across Ontario contained provisions
      that achieved this result.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      1989, the legislature enacted the <i>Employer Health Tax Act</i>, </span><i><span lang=EN-US>1989</span></i><span lang=EN-US>,
      S.O. 1989, c.&nbsp;76 [now R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;E.11], which eliminated
      the requirement that OHIP premiums be paid by Ontario residents.  Instead,
      the legislature imposed a “payroll tax” on employers, effective January
      1,&nbsp;1990.  The payroll tax regime rendered irrelevant the many provisions
      in collective agreements relating to an employer’s obligation to pay OHIP
      premiums on behalf of its employees.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      as the pages on the calendars turned in the 1990s and early 2000s, and
      as collective agreements expired and were renegotiated, the provisions
      relating to OHIP premiums were retained in many collective agreements,
      even though they had no current application.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This
      picture changed in 2004 with the enactment of the <i>Budget Measures Act,
      2004 (No. 2)</i>, S.O. 2004, c.&nbsp;29 (“Bill 106”), which amended the
      Ontario <i>Income Tax Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;I.2 (the “<i>ITA</i>”),
      by adding a new s.&nbsp;2.2(1):</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>2.2(1) Every individual shall
      pay a tax, called the Ontario Health Premium, for a taxation year ending
      after December&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2003 if the individual is resident in Ontario
      on the last day of the taxation year.</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The tax or premium
      imposed by s.&nbsp;2.2(1) is based on a person’s taxable income and can
      be up to $900 per year for those with taxable incomes of $200,000 or more.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      effect of s.&nbsp;2.2.(1) of the <i>ITA</i> was to awaken the provisions
      in collective agreements relating to various employers’ obligations to
      pay OHIP premiums on behalf of their employees.  These provisions had slumbered,
      Rip Van Winkle&#8209;like, for 14 years.  Now unions dusted them off and,
      focusing on the word ‘Premium’ in s.&nbsp;2.2(1) of the <i>ITA</i>, contended
      that employers were obligated to pay the new Ontario Health Premium (“OHP”)
      on behalf of their employees.  The employers continued to pay the employer
      health tax, but refused to pay the OHP.  They seized on the word “tax” in
      s.&nbsp;2.2(1) and said that there was a fundamental difference between
      a tax and premium.  Since the old collective agreements covered premiums
      only, the unions were wrong to try to stretch them to apply to the new
      OHP.</span></p>

      2004 and 2005, grievances flowered across Ontario.  Some arbitrators agreed
      with the unions, others sided with the employers, depending on the language
      of the particular collective agreement.  Losers on the arbitration stage
      shifted the spotlight to the Divisional Court through applications for
      judicial review of the arbitral awards.</span></p>

      five decisions from October&nbsp;2005 to February&nbsp;2006, the Divisional
      Court upheld all of the arbitral awards.  In each case, the court held
      that the standard of review of the arbitral award was patent unreasonableness
      and that the award was not patently unreasonable.  In the result, the Divisional
      Court upheld four arbitral awards in favour of unions and two<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

      central issues in all five appeals are: (1) what is the standard of review
      of the arbitral awards; and (2) applying the proper standard of review,
      was the Divisional Court correct to uphold the arbitral awards?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      propose to address these issues comprehensively in this appeal, which involves
      the first arbitral award and the first judicial review decision of the
      Divisional Court, and which was treated as the anchor appeal in the argument
      before this court.  In separate and briefer reasons, I will then consider
      the other appeals which involved different collective agreement language
      and, in some cases, different legal arguments.</span></p>

      in cases where the external statute is linked to the tribunal’s mandate
      and is frequently encountered by it, a measure of deference may be appropriate.  However,
      this does not mean that every time an administrative tribunal encounters
      an external statute in the course of its determination, the decision as
      a whole becomes open to review on a standard of correctness.  If that were
      the case, it would substantially expand the scope of reviewability of administrative
      decisions, and unjustifiably so ….</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>While the board may have to be
      correct in an isolated interpretation of external legislation, the standard
      of review of the decision as a whole, if that decision is otherwise within

      correctness of the interpretation of the external statute may affect the
      overall reasonableness of the decision.  Whether this is the case will
      depend on the impact of the statutory provision on the outcome of the decision

      Bill&nbsp;106.  However, she did so in the context of interpreting Article&nbsp;24.01
      of the collective agreement, which was her principal focus.  Indeed, in

      begin my analysis on this issue with the observation that there is an aura
      of serious rebuke associated with the label “patently unreasonable”: see </span><i><span lang=EN-US>Toronto
      Catholic District School Board v. Ontario English Catholic Teachers’ Assn.
      (Toronto Elementary Unit)</span></i><span lang=EN-US> (2001), 55 O.R. (3d)
      737 at para.&nbsp;34 (C.A.).  In a long line of cases, the Supreme Court
      of Canada has cautioned courts against easy resort to the label in the
      exercise of their judicial review function.  As expressed by Cory</span>&nbsp;J.
      in <i>Canada (Attorney General) v. Public Service Alliance of Canada</i>,
      [1993] 1 S.C.R. 941 at 963&#8209;64:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>It is said that it is difficult
      to know what “patently unreasonable” means.  What is patently unreasonable
      to one judge may be eminently reasonable to another.  Yet any test can
      only be defined by words, the building blocks of all reasons.  <i>Obviously,
      the patently unreasonable test sets a high standard of review</i>.  In
      the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary “patently”, an adverb, is defined
      as “openly, evidently, clearly”.  “Unreasonable” is defined as
    “[n]ot having the faculty of reason, irrational. . . .&nbsp;Not acting in
    accordance with reason or good sense”.  Thus, <i>based on the dictionary
    definition of the words “patently unreasonable” it is apparent that if the
    decision the Board reached, acting within its jurisdiction, is not clearly
    irrational, that is to say evidently not in accordance with reason, then
    it cannot be said that there was a loss of jurisdiction.  This is clearly
    a very strict test.</i>       [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

      first alleged error is the arbitrator’s apparent belief that all of the
      revenue raised under Bill&nbsp;106 would be dedicated to OHIP.  The arbitrator
      said: “In the instant case, the premium/tax is dedicated solely to funding
      O.H.I.P. and can fairly fit within the wording of Article&nbsp;24.01.”  The
      appellant contends that this is clearly wrong because the revenue generated
      by Bill&nbsp;106 will be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund and can
      be used for any purpose.  According to the appellant, this distinguishes
      Bill&nbsp;106 from the pre&#8209;1990 regime which collected premiums directly
      for OHIP premiums.</span></p>

      disagree.  While it is true that the new OHP is not dedicated exclusively
      to the funding of OHIP insured services, and that its funds go into the
      Government’s general revenue, this was equally true of revenue from the
      OHIP premium which also went into the Consolidated Revenue Fund and which
      was not traceable to any particular expenditures.  Indeed, there is, if
      anything, greater accountability in relation to the use of the OHP given
      that the Government is required to report, pursuant to s.&nbsp;29.1 of
      the </span><i><span lang=EN-US>ITA</span></i><span
lang=EN-US>, on the use of the revenue from the OHP in the Public Accounts for
      each fiscal year and has committed to use

      second alleged error in the arbitrator’s award, according to the appellant,
      is the arbitrator’s failure to appreciate that, from a legal perspective,
      the old OHIP premium was fundamentally different from the new OHP tax/premium.  Specifically,
      the arbitrator did not take account of the fact that the old OHIP premium
      had to be paid in order for OHIP coverage to be in effect, whereas failure
      to pay the OHP does not result in denial of coverage.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      my view, this factual difference is trivial and, therefore, immaterial.  The
      reality is that under both regimes the vast majority of employers would
      obey the law and collect and remit the required premiums with the result
      that their employees would receive the required coverage.  From the employee
      perspective, mandatory membership and payroll deductions under both regimes
      make the two regimes identical in practice.  </span></p>

      conclude with this observation.  In its reasons, the Divisional Court referred
      extensively to the arbitral award of Arbitrator&nbsp;K.P.&nbsp;Swan in <i>Ontario
      Power Generation Inc. v. Power Workers’ Union (Health Premium Grievance)</i>,
      [2005] O. L. A. A. No. 312, which involved a collective agreement provision
      very similar to Article&nbsp;24.01 of the collective agreement in issue
      in this appeal.  The court approved of the approach Arbitrator&nbsp;Swan
      set out in his award (para.&nbsp;44) and of the result he reached (para.&nbsp;56):</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the correct way to
      look at this issue is to consider what reasonable parties in the position
      of the Employer and the Union must have intended when they renegotiated
      the language into the current collective agreement.  Obviously, that renegotiation
      took place in a universe where there was no existing OHIP premium, and
      where OHIP was funded by the employer health tax.  At the same time, however,
      the language chosen must have been informed by the fact that at one time
      there had been an OHIP premium.  In my view, reasonable parties in their
      position would have intended that, should some government initiative in
      the future require that a payment for OHIP&#8209;insured services be required
      of individual employees, the Employer would be responsible to pay that
      on behalf of the individual employees, provided that it was materially
      and reasonably similar to the OHIP premium payable prior to 1989.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN-US>. . .</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Having regard to all of the submissions
      made to me, and to the considerable amount of energy exerted by other arbitrators
      in attempting to come to grips with similar issues, I have come to the
      conclusion that reasonable parties in the position of the present Employer
      and Union, negotiating for the current collective agreement, must have
      intended that the language which they use would cover not just the particular
      OHIP premium in existence before 1989, but any materially and reasonably
      similar premium to be established in the future.  In my view, the OHIP
      premium was a tax contributed to the consolidated revenues of the province
      with the intention that it be used to fund the OHIP health care system.  I
      think that the Ontario Health Premium is materially and reasonably similar
      to that, and the distinctions which are made in how the amount is calculated
      and how deduction and payment take place are distinctions that do not create
      a sufficient difference between the two to render the collective agreement
      language inapplicable to the Ontario Health Premium.</span></p>

      am sympathetic to this analysis.  It is not the only possible analysis
      of the collective agreement provision, considered in the context of Bill&nbsp;106
      and the previous statutes.  However, in my view, Arbitrator&nbsp;Swan’s
      analysis and award, and Arbitrator Barrett’s analysis and award in this
      case, are reasonable.  Crucially, they are far removed from being patently
      unreasonable.</span></p>
