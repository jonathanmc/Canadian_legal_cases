style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals from the judgment of Hoy&nbsp;J. dated January&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2006,
    wherein she dismissed the plaintiff/appellant’s claim that the steam rate
    it was obligated to pay the defendant/respondent pursuant to the 1994 Steam
    Sale Agreement (“the <i>SSA</i>”) was to be based on nuclear&#8209;generated
    steam only, not oil&#8209;fired steam.  The trial judge also held that the
    respondent did not breach its obligation to negotiate steam rates for 2004
    and, as a result, the contract between the parties came to an end on either
    November&nbsp;30 or December&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2003.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    central issue at trial was the interpretation of the words
    “the full reasonable cost recovery principle” in Article 2.2 of the <i>SSA</i> which
    provided:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.2       The term of this Agreement may be extended
    for one (1) year on the second anniversary of the Commencement Date and thereafter
    on each anniversary of the Commencement Date on the same terms and conditions
    as herein contained save and except for rates for Steam and Condensate.  The
    parties agree to commence negotiation of the rates for Steam and Condensate
    for the extension period of the Agreement on November&nbsp;1<sup>st</sup> of
    each year with a schedule for completion of negotiations not later than November&nbsp;30<sup>th</sup> of
    the same year.  Negotiations of the rates for Steam and Condensate will be
    based on the total quantity of Steam supplied by Hydro to all customers in
    BEC using <i>the full reasonable cost recovery principle</i> [emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    a comprehensive review of the witnesses and their evidence, the wording of
    Article&nbsp;2.2 and related provisions in the <i>SSA</i>, and the jurisprudence
    relating to the interpretation of contracts, the trial judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It seems clear to me that a clause entitling the
    supplier of goods to be paid an amount equal to the supplier’s full reasonable
    costs of supplying goods entitles the supplier to recover its <i>actual</i> costs.  I
    am able to come to that conclusion without considering extrinsic evidence
    of surrounding circumstances; however, what is “reasonable” cannot be determined
    in a vacuum.  Therefore, in my view, the phrase “full reasonable cost recovery
    principle” should be read in light of the surrounding circumstances prevalent
    at the time the 1994 Agreement was executed.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, the interpretation of the phrase “full
    reasonable cost recovery” advanced by Bruce Power, which I accept, promotes
    a sensible commercial result.  The 1994 Agreement does not have a fixed term,
    and has no provision for termination on notice.  It is not tied to Bruce
    Power’s ability to produce or supply nuclear generated steam to CAI.  Circumstances
    change over the course of a long&#8209;term arrangement.  “Full reasonable
    cost recovery” provides the requisite flexibility in such a potentially long&#8209;term
    arrangement.  It is unreasonable to adopt an interpretation that in addition
    to requiring Bruce Power to forego profit on the commercial supply would
    require Bruce Power to sustain a loss for an indefinite period.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that the trial judge erred in her interpretation of Article&nbsp;2.2
    in two respects – first, in her approach to the <i>SSA</i>; and second, in
    her failure to read it against its factual matrix.  We disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge approached the interpretation of the contract in precisely the
    fashion set out in the leading cases which she reviewed with great care.  In
    our view, the trial judge’s understanding and application of the principles
    in <i>Consolidated&#8209;Bathurst v. Mutual Boiler and Machinery Insurance
    Co.</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 888, <i>Venture Capital USA Inc. v. Yorkton Securities
    Inc.</i> (2005), 75 O.R. (3d) 325 (C.A.), and <i>Hi&#8209;Tech Group Inc.
    v. Sears Canada Inc.</i> (2001), 52 O.R. (3d) 97 (C.A.), were, in a word,
    impeccable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    also do not accept that the trial judge made any reversible error respecting
    the factual matrix.  The parties put forward competing versions of the factual
    matrix in 1994.  The trial judge accepted the respondent’s evidence as to
    the factual matrix.  As such, this submission raises a question which attracts
    the high hurdle of the “palpable and overriding error” standard of review:
    see <i>Housen v. Nikolaisen</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge very carefully set out and analyzed the factual background relating
    to the contract, and in particular in relation to the interpretation of the “full
    reasonable cost recovery” principle.  Moreover, her conclusion was explicit:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The litigation involving Hydro, the fact that in
    1994 a portion of the steam supplied to CAI in 1994 was generated by the
    oil fuelled back&#8209;up boiler, and the factual matrix identified by Bruce
    Power, comprise the surrounding circumstances that were prevalent at the
    time that the parties entered into the 1994 Agreement.  Those surrounding
    circumstances, in addition to assisting in interpreting what is “reasonable”,
    also buttress my finding that the 1994 Agreement entitles Bruce Power to
    recover its <i>actual</i> costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, there is nothing in the record before us or in the trial judge’s
    comprehensive analysis of the <i>SSA</i> in the context of its factual matrix
    to suggest that her conclusion on this issue amounts to a palpable and overriding
    error.  The circumstances set out in this paragraph and in her description
    of the “factual matrix identified by Bruce Power” are founded in the evidence
    and support her interpretation of the contract.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in her application of the
    doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> with respect to the judgment of Cameron&nbsp;J.
    in 1997 in a related lawsuit between the same parties.  Nothing turns on
    this issue.  The subject matter of the litigation before Cameron&nbsp;J.
    was far removed from the factors relevant to the interpretation of Article&nbsp;2.2
    of the <i>SSA</i>.  Moreover, the trial judge made it clear in para.&nbsp;125
    of her reasons that she was able to come to the findings she did without
    reliance on the doctrine.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is dismissed.  The respondent is entitled to its costs of the appeal
    fixed at $20,000 inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
