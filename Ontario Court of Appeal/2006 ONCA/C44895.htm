    issue in the second action, Caswell J. found that Mr.&nbsp;Stone’s calculations

    expenses and assets of the Stone/Polon partnership for the period February
    1, 1992, to January 31, 1998.  At para. 54 of her reasons, she directed the

      were taken in the arbitration proceeding.  Both parties were represented
      by counsel throughout.  In January&nbsp;2003, Mr.&nbsp;Stone asked the
      arbitrator to find that the scope of the arbitration was restricted to
      the period after February 1, 1998.  He argued that the earlier trial before
      Caswell J., her decision and the subsequent decision of this court upholding
      her decision in respect of the accounts for the period February&nbsp;1,&nbsp;1992
      to January&nbsp;31,&nbsp;1998, constituted an issue estoppel that prevented
      the arbitrator from re&#8209;examining the accounts for that period.  He
      maintained that he had agreed to arbitration in order to determine and
      settle the accounts for the period after February 1, 1998.</span></p>

      of the accounts.     </span></p>

      2003, he stated: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>From this, it is unequivocally clear to me that
    the parties have agreed to an audit of the accounting records prepared by
    Mr.&nbsp;Stone.  The Joint Submission was executed on December&nbsp;6,&nbsp;2002,
    almost 3 years after the Judgments of the Court of Appeal and Madame Justice
    Caswell.  It is my opinion that this is an agreement that stands on its own
    and was entered into on the advice of counsel.  While a determination of
    issues must have regard to the judgments of Madame Justice Caswell and the
    Court of Appeal, the parties specifically agreed in paragraph 5 to the delivery
    of full particulars on all claims and disputes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . . </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I feel I must comment on Mr. Ellyn’s able representations
    with respect to issue estoppel.  I cannot give effect to that argument since
    the parties by their own volition entered into an Arbitration Agreement as
    a means of resolving their differences as evidenced in paragraph 2 of the
    Submission.  Meaning must be attributed to the ‘Submission’
    which includes the following words:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>“Parties cannot agree on the final accounting
    for the winding up of their partnership and agree to submit a dispute to
    a single arbitrator for binding arbitration in accordance with the Joint
    Submission.” </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>The issues are set forth in the Joint Submission
    for Arbitration.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Parties have now agreed to a final accounting
    of the 1992 agreement.  If estoppel had been applicable, the parties [would]
    have agreed otherwise.  Exhibit 5-90 remains the guide for the accounting
    but in my view, the review and possible amendment of particular items remains
    open.  For instance, one open question is what, in accounting terms, does
    a “guide” mean?  Is it definitive of all matters or does it offer a generalized
    instruction?</p>

    an e-mail dated February 11, 2003, Mr. Stone’s counsel reserved his right
    to appeal the decision in accordance with the terms of the arbitration agreement.  No
    appeal of the decision was undertaken.  Mr.&nbsp;Stone did, however, take
    steps to comply with other aspects of the arbitrator’s decision that required
    him to produce certain documents.   </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.&nbsp;Stone

    the matter of the scope of the arbitration.  In the fall of 2004, the arbitrator
    refused to hear argument on the issue as he had already ruled and no appeal
    had been taken from that ruling.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.&nbsp;Stone

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    para.&nbsp;15 of his reasons, the motion judge explained why he found the
    arbitration agreement to be invalid, saying:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am satisfied that there was no consensus <i>ad&nbsp;idem</i> between
    the parties in the creation of the arbitration agreement.  The very subject
    matter of the arbitration is, to my mind, sufficiently central to the purpose
    of the arbitration that what I view as totally different opinions as to what
    the actual subject was to be about amounts to there being no contract at
    all.  If one party to a contract makes it on one set of terms and the other
    intends to make it on another set of terms, there is no contact, unless the
    circumstances are such as to preclude one of the parties from denying that
    he or she has agreed to terms of the offer.  See <i>Tilden Rent&#8209;A&#8209;Car
    Co. v. Clendenning</i> (1978), 18 O.R. (2d) 601 (C.A.) at 605.  To my mind,
    it does not seem reasonable to suppose that Stone was giving his real consent
    to re&#8209;examining the accounts in the earlier period when in fact they
    had been reviewed over a six&#8209;day period at trial in court had been
    found consistent with his point of view and had been confirmed by the Court
    of Appeal.</p>

      7(2) gives the court the discretion to refuse to stay the proceeding for
      one or more of  five reasons.    </span></p>

      this court recently reiterated in <i>Woolcock v. Bushert</i>, [2004] O.J.
      No. 4498 at para. 14, to determine whether to stay a proceeding pursuant
      to s. 7(1), the court must begin by interpreting the arbitration provision.  It
      must then analyze the claims in the action to determine whether those claims
      are to be decided by the arbitrator under the terms of the arbitration
      agreement, as interpreted by the court.  If so, subject to the exercise
      of discretion based on the limited exceptions in s. 7(2), the court is
      required to stay the proceeding.  </span></p>

      this case, there can be no doubt but that the matters in issue in this
      proceeding are the same as those to be decided by the arbitration.  For
      example, in paragraphs 1(a) through (d) of the Statement of Claim, Mr.
      Stone (as plaintiff) claims money from Mr. Polon in respect of the partnership
      accounts of DMS.  And, in paras. 1(e) and (g), he asks for orders implementing
      the judgment of Caswell J. and declaring that the accounts for the period
      February 1, 1992, and January&nbsp;31,&nbsp;1998, are not capable of being
      the subject of arbitration under Ontario law as they have been determined
      by the Judgment of the Honourable Madam Justice Caswell dated February&nbsp;22,&nbsp;1999.</span></p>

      1, 2 and 4 of the arbitration agreement, set out previously, establish
      that the scope of the arbitration is to settle the partnership accounts
      as between Mr. Stone and Mr. Polon.  The role that is to be played by the
      judgment of Caswell J., including her determination that Exhibit 5 – 90
      is to be used as a guide for the accounts, clearly falls within the scope
      of the arbitration.  Indeed, para. 4(c) of the arbitration agreement says
      just that.  </span></p>

      in accordance with s. 7(1) of the <i>Arbitration Act</i>, the action should

      chooses to exercise its discretion and refuse the stay.</span></p>

      motion judge refused to stay the proceedings on the basis of invalidity,
      the second exception in s. 7(2) of the <i>Arbitration Act</i>.  In my view,
      he erred in law in concluding that the arbitration agreement was invalid.  On
      a plain reading of the arbitration agreement, the arbitration was to settle
      the partnership accounts of Messrs. Stone and Polon using Exhibit 5 – 90
      as a guide.  There was no need to go behind the arbitration agreement to
      examine the intentions of the parties in entering into the agreement.  Indeed,
      to do so was an error.  As stated by Archibald J. at para.&nbsp;21 in <i>Magnotta
      Winery Corp. v. Ziraldo</i>, [1999] O.J. No. 3968 (Sup. Ct.), arbitration
      agreements are contracts and governed by contract law, where the law is
      not in conflict with the <i>Arbitration Act</i>.  On basic contract principles,
      as there was no ambiguity in the arbitration agreement, the scope of the
      arbitration is determined by its terms.        </span></p>

      respect, I do not read <i>Tilden Rent-a-Car Co. v. Clendenning </i>(1978),
      18 O.R. (2d) 601 (C.A.) to the contrary.  In that case, this court affirms
      that a party’s signature to a contract is one way of manifesting assent
      to its terms.  However, the signature can be relied on as manifesting assent
      only where it is reasonable for the party relying on the signed document
      to believe that the signer really did assent.  In <i>Tilden</i>, the car
      rental company emphasized speed and ease of transactions.  The court found
      that the company could be held to know that its customers did not really
      assent to all of the unusual and onerous printed terms in the documents
      that they signed, which terms were not drawn to their attention.</span></p>

      is not this case.  Mr. Stone was represented by counsel throughout.  He
      prepared the initial draft of the arbitration agreement.  Its terms were
      negotiated.  There is nothing unusual or onerous in its terms.  He agreed
      to the terms of the arbitration agreement.  His counsel executed the agreement
      on his behalf.  There is nothing to suggest he did not assent to its terms.  On
      the contrary, it is clear that he did.       <i> </i></span></p>

      respondent seeks to rely also on the third exception in s. 7(2), namely,
      that the “subject-matter of the dispute is not capable of being the subject
      of arbitration under Ontario law”.  This argument rests on the notion that
      issue estoppel operates to preclude the arbitrator from reconsidering the
      accounts for the period from February 1, 1992, to January 31, 1998.  While
      issue estoppel might apply if the matter were before the courts, I do not
      accept that it applies to the arbitration.  The parties to the arbitration
      agreement freely agreed to have a final accounting of the wind-up of their
      partnership decided by arbitration.  By the express terms of the arbitration
      agreement, they agreed that such a determination was to be made “having
      regard to the judgment of Caswell J.”  Had they wished to limit the scope
      of the arbitration based on that judgment, they were free to so stipulate.  They
      did not.  Thus, the arbitrator is to decide the dispute in accordance with
      the terms of the arbitration agreement.</span></p>

      2006, it is trite law that when persons choose to resolve their differences
      by arbitration, the courts will ordinarily hold them to their agreement.  In
      the circumstances of this case, there is every reason to adhere to that
      principle.  Messrs. Stone and Polon consensually entered into arbitration
      after negotiating the terms of an arbitration agreement through their respective
      counsel.  The parties commenced the arbitration and were represented by
      counsel throughout.  After full argument on the issue of the scope of the
      arbitrator’s jurisdiction, a carefully reasoned decision on that matter
      was handed down by the arbitrator.  Mr. Stone did not appeal that decision
      despite the fact that the appeal provision in the arbitration agreement
      appears to give him that right.  Thereafter, Mr. Stone took a fresh step
      in the arbitration.  In my view, not only does s. 7 require that a stay
      be ordered, it would be an abuse of process to allow this proceeding to
      continue.</span></p>
