style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue raised by this appeal is whether the Ministry of Health and Long-Term
    Care (the Ministry) should pay the costs of the successful defendants following
    a trial by jury wherein the claims of the plaintiffs were dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    facts which give rise to the appeal are not in dispute. On November 16, 1997
    a fire severely damaged the plaintiffs’ home and the contents thereof. The
    home was insured by the Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company, which resolved
    the property damage claims through the appraisal process set out in the <i>Insurance
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I. 8. Servicemaster and Tuppen Construction were
    hired to restore the plaintiffs’ home and repair its contents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiffs claimed: damages for the Wawanesa’s negligent, unfair, and deceptive
    acts and practices in their adjustment of the plaintiffs’
    insurance claim; aggravated damages for mental stress and physical and emotional
    injury arising from the shoddy and negligent work of Servicemaster and Tuppen
    Construction in repairing their home and its contents; punitive damages for
    breach by Wawanesa of its fiduciary duties and duty of utmost good faith
    in the handling of the plaintiffs’ insurance claim; and other related relief.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    action was tried at Milton before a jury over 70 days. The jury found no
    liability on the part of the defendants and assessed the plaintiffs’ damages
    at zero.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that the defendants were entitled to costs on a substantial
    indemnity basis and fixed Wawanesa’s costs at $564,998.73 and those of the
    remaining defendants, all of whom were represented by Mr. Zuber at trial,
    in the sum of $489,969.03.  No issue is taken with either the scale of costs
    or the quantum.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defendants sought to have the trial judge award costs jointly and severally
    against the adult plaintiffs and the Ministry. The trial judge concluded
    that only the adult plaintiffs, John and Annette DiBattista, were jointly
    and severally responsible for the defendants’ costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiffs included in their claim the subrogated interest of the Ontario
    Health Insurance Plan (the Plan) for the cost of insured services received
    by the plaintiffs following the fire as they were required to do by the following
    provisions of the <i>Health Insurance Act</i>,<i> </i>1990 R.S.O., c.&nbsp;H.6:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>30(1)            Where,
    as the result of negligence or other wrongful act or omission of another,
    an insured person suffers personal injuries for which he or she receives
    insured services under this Act, the Plan is subrogated to any right of the
    insured  person to recover the cost incurred for past insured services and
    the cost that will probably be incurred for future insured services, and
    the General Manager may bring action in the name of the Plan or in the name
    of that person for the recovery of such costs.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>31(1)            Any
    person who commences an action to recover for loss or damages arising out
    of the negligence or other wrongful act of a third party, to which the injury
    or disability in respect of which insured services have been provided is
    related shall, unless otherwise advised in writing by the General Manager,
    include a claim on behalf of the Plan for the cost of the insured services.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Plan’s subrogated interest, which the plaintiffs included in their claim
    was for $8,057.98 plus interest. On the forty-third day of trial the Ministry
    withdrew its claim against the defendants with costs issues reserved to the
    conclusion of the trial. As the trial judge noted at para. 8 of her reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The Ministry
    counsel did not attend the trial nor participate in the trial in any way.
    No one from the Ministry gave evidence at trial. The Ministry never presented
    its subrogated claim at trial and the jury was not asked to make any assessment
    of the Ministry’s damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    position of the defendants is neatly summarized in para. 9 of the reasons
    of the trial judge as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The defendants
    rely on section 39(6) of R.R.O. Reg. 552 of the <i>Health Insurance Act</i> in
    support of their claim for costs against the Ministry. The defendants’ position
    is that even though the jury was not asked to assess the Ministry’s claim,
    that it can be assumed that it would have been assessed one of two ways.
    The first option is to assume the jury would have assessed the Ministry’s
    claim in the full amount of $8057.98, in which situation the defendants argue
    on a proportionate basis the Ministry should be responsible for all of the
    costs of all defendants. The alternate assumption is that the jury would
    have assessed the Ministry’s claim at zero, which would mean that on a proportionate
    basis, the plaintiff’s and Ministry’s claims would have been equal. Applying
    joint and several liability, the defendants argue that the Ministry should
    be jointly and severally liable to the defendants for all of the costs awarded
    to the defendants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge rejected the defendants’ arguments. She carefully considered
    all of the particular circumstances of the case relating to the Ministry’s
    involvement and concluded that no costs should be awarded against the Ministry.
    I agree with her conclusion.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'><u>ANALYSIS</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section  39(6)
    of <i>Regulation</i> <i>552</i> of the <i>Health Insurance Act</i>, <i>supra</i> provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>39(6)            Subject
    to subsection (8), where an insured person obtains a final judgment in an
    action in which he or she includes a claim on behalf of the Plan, the Plan
    shall bear the same proportion of the taxable costs otherwise payable by
    the insured person, whether on a party and party basis or on a solicitor
    and client basis, as the recovery made on behalf of the plan bears to the
    total recovery of the insured person in the action, or where no recovery
    is made, as the assessed claim of the Plan bears to the total damages of
    the insured person assessed by the court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am of the view that s. 39(6) has no application on the facts of this case
    where there has been no assessment of the Plan’s interest and the plaintiff’s
    damages have been assessed at zero.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a matter of common sense, it would, in my view, be quite unreasonable to
    hold the Plan, with a subrogated interest of just over $8000.00, liable for
    costs which total in excess of $1,000,000.00.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defendants argue that the Ministry knowingly participated in a trial fraught
    with risk and was a full participant in the litigation. In this respect they
    rely on the words of Granger J. in <i>Marchand v. Public General Hospital
    of Chatham </i>(1997), 33 O.R. (3d), 570 (Gen. Div.), aff’d (2000), 51 O.R.
    (3d) 97 (costs order varied on different basis),  leave to appeal to S.C.C.
    refused, [2001] S.C.C.A. No. 66. In <i>Marchand, </i>the Ministry withdrew
    its claim for past and future insured services on the seventieth day of a
    165 day trial. The issue of costs was reserved to the conclusion of trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Granger
    J. assessed the plaintiff’s damages exclusive of the interest of the Plan.
    at $1,139,873.92. He assessed the Plan’s interest as of April 22, 1994 (the
    date of withdrawal of its claim) for past and future services at $158,694.9,
    12.22 per cent of the total assessment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiff’s action in <i>Marchand</i> was dismissed and the defendants’ costs
    were fixed in the total sum of $2,154,448.29. As Granger J. noted in his
    reasons, had the plan continued in the action and had its claim assessed
    in the sum of $158,964.69 it would have been responsible for 12.22 per cent
    or $263,273.58 of the costs payable by the plaintiffs. He accepted that as
    of the date of the Plan’s withdrawal from the action the defendants’ cost
    totalled $1,036,836.00. Granger J. found that to April 22, 1994 the Plan
    was a full partner in the litigation, that it was a sophisticated insurer
    with substantial resources, and that it understood the risks of the litigation
    including its liability for costs in the event the action was dismissed.
    He further found that although the Plan had discontinued its claim, it was
    nevertheless liable for costs under Rule 23.05. Being satisfied that the
    Plan was an equal partner in the litigation, he concluded that it should
    be responsible for its proportionate share of the costs payable by the plaintiffs.
    He considered the formula set out in s. 39(6) of  Regulation 552 to be an
    appropriate basis on which to determine the Plan’s liability for costs as
    of April 22, 1994.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    distinguishing <i>Marchand</i> from the case before her, the trial judge
    noted that the Ministry did no more than forward a few pieces of correspondence,
    payment summaries and updates. Ministry counsel did not attend or participate
    in the trial in any way. The Ministry did not take a position on liability,
    nor did it lead any evidence. Its subrogated claims occupied very little
    trial time, and the jury was not asked to make any assessment of the Ministry’s
    damages. The Ministry did not participate in pretrial or settlement negotiations,
    did not complicate the proceedings or cause any delay, and took no steps
    to prolong the dispute. Finally, there was no indication that the Ministry’s
    claim had any bearing on the plaintiffs’
    decision to go to trial. On the facts before her, the trial judge could not
    find that the Ministry was an equal partner in the litigation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
    concluded that to assess costs against the Ministry in the manner requested
    by the defendants would be unfair and unreasonable. Further she concluded
    that if Rule 23 was applicable any costs awarded against the Ministry would
    be negligible because its claim added no time or complexity to the trial,
    the subrogated claims were minor compared to the plaintiffs’ other claims,
    and any costs she might award would be more than offset by the Ministry’s
    costs of filing two factums and having its counsel attend for the costs submissions.
    She therefore ordered that no costs be awarded against the Ministry. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    fixing costs a trial judge enjoys a broad discretion. As Arbour J. noted
    in <i>Hamilton v. Open Window Bakery</i> (2003), [2004] 1 S.C.R. 303 at para.
    27, “[a] court should set aside a costs award on appeal only if the trial
    judge has made an error in principle or if the costs award is plainly wrong” [citation
    omitted].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, s. 39(6) of <i>Regulation </i>552, <i>supra</i>, has no application
    where the Plan’s claim has not been assessed. It would be dangerous to assume
    what the jury <i>might</i> have done had the claim been submitted for their
    consideration. It was not. There was no assessment of the claim and in these
    circumstances s. 39(6) does not apply. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    such circumstances it is appropriate for the court to look to rule 23.05
    which provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Where a plaintiff
    discontinues an action against a defendant, </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>(a)            the
    defendant is entitled to the costs of the action; …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>… unless the
    court orders otherwise.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge here carefully considered the nature of the case before her and
    weighed the relevant factors. She made no error in principle and her award
    cannot be said to be plainly wrong.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is dismissed. Costs to the Ministry fixed in the sum of $8,500.00
    inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T. for the costs of both the application
    for leave to appeal and the appeal.</p>
