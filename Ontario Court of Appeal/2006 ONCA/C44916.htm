style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, Ms. Martin, applies for leave to appeal, and if leave is granted,
    appeals the decision of the summary conviction appeal court judge, allowing
    the Crown’s appeal against her acquittal for the offence of impaired driving,
    contrary to s. 253(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  At trial the appellant
    was also acquitted of the charge of driving over 80, contrary to s. 253(b),
    but the Crown did not appeal the acquittal on this charge to the summary
    conviction appeal court judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span

      appellant asks that her conviction for impaired driving by the </span>summary
      conviction appeal court judge be vacated
      and that an order go re-instating the trial judge’s acquittal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Issues</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issues on this appeal are: Did the summary conviction appeal court judge
    substitute his own opinion related to impaired operation of a motor vehicle
    for that of the trial judge?  Did the summary conviction appeal court judge
    fail or refuse to consider the lack of evidence of impairment by alcohol?  If
    the trial judge did err, was that error an error of law?  Were the reasons
    of the summary conviction appeal court judge adequate?</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Analysis and Disposition</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    deciding to acquit the appellant, the trial judge relied on the testimony
    of an experienced police officer to the effect that the officer had only
    a suspicion that the appellant had alcohol in her system.  The officer did
    not believe that he had grounds to arrest her for impaired driving due to
    alcohol.  The appellant submits that the trial judge was obliged to accept
    the officer’s evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our opinion, just because the arresting officer was of the opinion that he
    did not have grounds to arrest the appellant for impaired driving the trial
    judge was not obliged to acquit.  The trial judge had other evidence to consider
    besides that of the police officer indicating that the appellant was impaired,
    specifically the evidence of the civilian witness. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    indictment specified that the appellant was impaired by alcohol.  Early in
    his reasons the trial judge acknowledged that there was “certainly evidence
    of impaired driving of some sort.”  The trial judge erred in law in holding
    that without the results of the breath test he could not convict the appellant
    for impairment due to alcohol consumption:  <i>R. v. Stellato</i> (1993),
    78 C.C.C. (3d) 380 (Ont. C.A.), aff’d (1994), 90 C.C.C. (3d) 160 (S.C.C.).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    police officer testified that he noted a stale odour of alcohol on the appellant’s
    breath.  When asked about alcohol consumption by the police officer, the
    appellant said she had been taking a herbal remedy.  The appellant said there
    may have been alcohol in the herbal remedy she was taking.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Assuming
    alcohol consumption was a necessary particular, it was open to the trial
    judge to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant’s impairment was
    due to alcohol.  The trial judge had to decide based on all the evidence
    whether the appellant’s ability to drive a motor vehicle was impaired due
    to alcohol.  It appears that the trial judge failed to take into account
    all of the evidence.  The summary conviction appeal court judge was correct
    to intervene and order a new trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> Insofar
    as the appellant attacks the reasons of the summary conviction appeal court
    judge as being inadequate, the reasons give a clear indication as to why
    the appeal was allowed and it cannot be said that the brief reasons foreclosed
    meaningful appellate review.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal from conviction is therefore dismissed.</p>
