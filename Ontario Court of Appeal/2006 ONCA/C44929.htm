      Justice Elizabeth M. Stewart of the Superior Court of Justice, dated August
      18, 2005, allowing the appeal from the Award of the Arbitrator Guy Jones,
      dated July 28, 2004.</span></h4>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is an appeal about the meaning of “principally dependent”
    for “care” as that term is used in the <i>Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule</i>,
    O. Reg. 403/96, a regulation under the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. I.8.  Arbitrator Jones determined that Joshua Williams was not principally
    dependent on his mother for care when he was involved in a motor vehicle
    accident that left him with quadriplegia. On appeal from that decision, Stewart
    J. set aside the arbitrator’s decision and substituted her decision that
    Mr. Williams was principally dependent on his mother for care.  The motion
    judge’s decision was based primarily on the nature of Mr. Williams’s relationship
    with his mother since, at the time of the accident, Mr. Williams was living
    with her as his surety. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the nature of the surety relationship, while relevant, is not determinative.
    Since the arbitrator’s decision was based on reasonable factual findings
    and the application of correct legal principles, I would restore the arbitrator’s
    decision.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Williams’s accident and injuries occurred in July 2002.  He applied for statutory
    accident benefits.  The question arose as to which of two insurers would
    pay those benefits: his mother’s insurer, Oxford Mutual Insurance Company
    (Oxford), or the insurer of the car that Mr. Williams occupied at the time
    of the accident, Co-operators General Insurance Company (Co-operators). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    answer depended on the application of s. 268(2) of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, which
    provides that Mr. Williams’s recourse is first against Oxford if Mr. Williams
    was “an insured person” under his mother’s policy at the time of the accident.  The <i>Statutory
    Accident Benefits Schedule</i><i> </i>defines an “insured person” as one
    who is a “dependant” of a named insured and provides that a person is a “dependant
    of another person if the person is <i>principally</i><b> </b><i>dependent</i> for
    financial support or <i>care</i> on the other person or the other person’s
    spouse.”  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    Mr. Williams was not an insured person under his mother’s policy, he would
    have recourse against Co-operators, the insurer of the automobile in which
    he was an occupant.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Mr.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    facts are not in dispute.  In 2002, at the time of the accident, Mr. Williams
    was 22 years of age.  In 1999 or 2000, he moved from his mother’s Ontario
    home to British Columbia where he worked and lived with friends.  On occasion,
    his mother sent small sums to help him financially, but Mr. Williams was
    otherwise self-sufficient.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2001, Mr. Williams returned to Ontario.  He lived briefly with his mother.  He
    then moved in with his girlfriend, living first at her parents’ home, then
    in an apartment and then with a friend. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    early 2002, Mr. Williams and his girlfriend separated and she moved back
    to her parents’ home.  In March 2002, Mr. Williams was charged with assaulting
    and threatening his former girlfriend.  In April 2002, he was released on
    bail with his mother acting as his surety on agreed-upon terms. Those terms
    provided that Mr. Williams would leave his apartment to reside with his mother
    and obey her house rules, which were filed with the court.  Those rules required
    Mr. Williams to stay away from his former girlfriend and her friends, go
    straight to and from work, obey a curfew of 11:00 p.m. on non-work nights,
    keep his mother informed of his whereabouts, refrain from attending at local
    bars, and work with his mother to seek counselling. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    on release, Mr. Williams continued to work nights from about 4:00 p.m. to
    2:00 a.m.  Since his mother worked days, they rarely saw each other during
    the week, although he had meals at home one or two times a week.  On the
    weekends, Mr. Williams was away for much of the time socializing with friends. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is not contested that Mr. Williams was independent in the sense that he cared
    for his own personal needs, provided his own transportation, took care of
    his own finances, and contributed to the household both financially and by
    way of taking responsibility for chores. </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
      arbitrator’s decision</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    arbitrator was asked to determine whether Mr. Williams was principally dependent
    on his mother either for financial support or for care at the time of the
    accident.  The arbitrator found that he was not dependent in either way. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    arriving at his decision on both issues, the arbitrator considered various
    uncontested legal principles, including that “principally”
    dependent means “chiefly”, “mainly” or “for the most part”.  See <i>Towsley
    v.  Royal Insurance Co.</i>, [1996] O.I.C.D. No. 25.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    arbitrator considered the important issue of the appropriate time frame on
    which to base his determination and recognized that a
    “snapshot” approach on the day of the accident was inappropriate. Rather,
    the time frame chosen must be one that provides a fair picture of the relationship
    at the time of the accident. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    Mr. Williams’s circumstances, the arbitrator held that the appropriate time
    frame began in “at least early 2001” when Mr. Williams returned to Ontario.  However,
    he also said that he would have come to the same result even if he had used
    an earlier or later date, including the date of April 2002, when Mr. Williams
    began living with his mother as his surety.  The arbitrator characterized
    Mr. Williams’s return to his mother’s household as a
    “brief aberration [that]… should not be looked at in isolation” because Mr.
    Williams only lived with his mother to avoid jail and he intended to move
    out as soon as his criminal charges were resolved. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    he applied the same time frame to the question of
    “care” dependency, the arbitrator recognized that the “care” issue “cannot
    be determined with the same mathematical precision” as the issue of financial
    dependency. See <i>Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Co. v. Underwriters, Lloyd’s
    of London Insurance Co. </i>(2004), 72 O.R. (3d) 762 (S.C.J.) at para. 17.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once
    he established the appropriate time frame, the arbitrator considered the
    implications of the bail provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,<i> </i>R.S.C.
    1985, c. C-46 and acknowledged the “classical notion” that a surety, at least
    historically, was a “constructive jailer”. See Gary T. Trotter, <i>The Law
    of Bail in Canada</i>, 2d ed. (Scarborough: Carswell, 2000) at 280.  He went
    on to consider the obligations of the surety in this case and Mr. Williams’s
    particular circumstances in his mother’s home.  In addition, he considered
    Co-operators’ argument analogizing Mr. Williams’s situation to the regulation’s
    definition of a person “in need of care” for the purposes of caregiver benefits.
    As well, he considered dictionary definitions of
    “care”.  While recognizing that other cases decided the issue on the basis
    of the “dependant’s” physical or emotional needs, the arbitrator was “also
    prepared to accept that a person may be principally dependent for care upon
    their surety” even though not physically and emotionally dependent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
    based on the time frame chosen, the limited supervision exercised by Mr.
    Williams’s mother and Mr. Williams’s substantial personal independence, the
    arbitrator concluded that he was not dependent on her for his care.  In the
    result, Co-operators and not Oxford was responsible for payment of Mr. Williams’s
    statutory accident benefits.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
      motion judge’s reasons</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal to the motion judge, Oxford challenged only the finding that Mr. Williams
    was not principally dependent for his care on his mother.  Since the issue
    of statutory interpretation is generally considered a question of law, the
    motion judge determined “correctness” to be the appropriate standard of review
    of the arbitrator’s decision.  In coming to this conclusion, the motion judge
    rejected the argument that deference should be given to the arbitrator’s
    decision on the basis of his special expertise. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the motion judge relied on the same principles of law and definitions as
    did the arbitrator and she acknowledged the need to look at Mr. Williams’s
    physical care arrangements, she made no reference to the particulars of those
    arrangements.  Rather, she focussed on the basis for and the nature of the
    surety relationship as “of great importance” to the resolution of the issue.  She
    found that since the mother acted as a
    “constructive jailer”, she exercised a “measure of physical control” over
    Mr. Williams. As well, she considered it significant whether the “care situation
    is temporary, long-term or permanent and, if it can be terminated, then by
    which party and on what basis”. See <i>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance
    Co. v. Non-Marine Underwriters</i>, [1997] O.J. No. 3402 (S.C.J.).  Concluding
    that it was not open for Mr. Williams to terminate the surety order, the
    motion judge determined that his dependence on his mother would continue
    for a considerable and indefinite time, at least until the next scheduled
    court date of December 2002.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a result of the “nature of the relationship” and the
    “significant obligations of ‘care’” (in the sense of “control”) inherent
    in the surety relationship, the motion judge concluded that Mr. Williams
    was principally dependent upon his mother for his care.  In the result, she
    substituted her decision for that of the arbitrator. Oxford and not Co-operators
    would be responsible for payment of Mr. Williams’s statutory accident benefits.  </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the motion judge’s reasons err in three respects.  First, the question
    before the arbitrator was not simply a question of law and, even if it was,
    the arbitrator considered the correct legal principles.  In that circumstance,
    the arbitrator’s application of those legal principles to his factual findings
    was entitled to deference.  Second, the time frame used by the motion judge
    was too narrow.  Third, in light of the arbitrator’s factual findings about
    the <i>de facto</i> independence of Mr. Williams, the legal nature of the
    surety relationship cannot be determinative. <i></i></p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>1.            Standard

line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    question before the arbitrator was whether the relationship between Mr. Williams
    and his mother made him principally dependent upon her for his care.  In
    answering that question, the arbitrator considered the correct legal principles,
    including the nature of the surety relationship.  He also recognized that
    the case should be determined on its own particular facts keeping in mind
    all relevant factors.  See <i>Miller v. Safeco</i> <i>Insurance Co. of America</i> (1984),
    48 O.R. (2d) 451 (H.C.J.), aff’d (1985), 50 O.R. (2d) 797 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    those circumstances, the question became one of applying the correct legal
    principles to his factual findings about the particular circumstances of
    Mr. Williams’s relationship with his mother.  Accordingly, the question before
    the arbitrator was one of mixed fact and law and was closer to a factual
    determination.  See <i>Liberty Mutual</i> <i>Insurance Co. v. Federation
    Insurance Co. of Canada</i>, [1997]<i> </i>O.J. No. 1234 (C.A.).  Given the
    special expertise of arbitrators in evaluating facts for a determination
    of dependency for statutory accident benefits entitlement, unless the arbitrator’s
    decision was unreasonable, it was entitled to deference. In any event, in
    my view, the arbitrator’s decision was also correct. <i></i></p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>2.         The

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    determination depended upon whether Mr. Williams was a dependant of his mother
    for his care at the time of the accident. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    section of the <i>Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule</i> under consideration
    in this case is s. 2(6). For the purposes of s. 2(6), the relationship to
    be examined is not a “snapshot” at the time of the accident as it is in other
    sections of the regulation.  For example, s. 2(1)(a) provides that a spouse
    of an insured person is also an insured person.  Whether a person occupies
    the legal status of a spouse on a specific date is much easier to determine
    than whether a person is principally dependent upon another for care.  In
    the same vein, caregiver benefits are available under s. 13 to a “person
    in need of care”, which includes a person who is less than sixteen years
    of age:  the age of a person at the date of an accident involves a
    “snapshot” in time. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    contrast, under s. 2(6), the true characterization of a dependent relationship
    at the time of the accident will usually require consideration of that relationship
    over a period of time, particularly in the case of young adults whose lives
    are in transition.  The parameters of that period will depend on the facts
    of the case.  The time frame chosen will also be influenced by the nature
    of the relationship between the person providing the care and the person
    receiving the care. The analysis may also consider the degree of care provided
    to the individual at certain times as well as the individual’s need for care.</p>

    relationships.… The evaluation should be made by examining a period of time

    this case, the arbitrator did not confine the time frame to the period of
    the surety relationship but looked to a reasonable period beyond that time
    frame to determine the true nature of the relationship.  In my view, the
    arbitrator properly considered the recent and long standing independent relationship
    that Mr. Williams had with his mother in the time prior to the surety order
    and that he unequivocally intended to resume upon completion of the criminal
    proceedings.  Only by looking at that relationship as a whole, over a reasonable
    period of time, is the arbitrator able to determine the nature of the relationship
    at the time of the accident. Over this period, and the respondent acknowledges
    this, Mr. Williams was independent of his mother for his care.  Moreover,
    as the arbitrator concluded, this finding would not change even if the period
    was confined to the time of the surety relationship.</p>

    the motion judge acknowledged that a snapshot view was inappropriate, her
    reasoning was based on her determination that the surety relationship had
    been in place for three months and would continue for an indefinite time.  In
    my view, the focus of the trial judge’s reasons on the legal nature of a
    surety relationship unduly restricted her view of the relevant time frame
    to the period of the surety order.  While in some cases, the nature of the
    relationship may dictate a narrow time frame for a determination of the issue,
    as I will discuss, the nature of Mr. Williams’s relationship with his mother
    did not. </p>

    summary, the arbitrator was entitled to rely on a broader time frame that
    provided a perspective on the state of the relationship at the time of the
    accident. In any event, the arbitrator would have reached the same conclusion
    even if he considered the narrower surety time frame. His decision about
    the appropriate time frame was entitled to deference.<i></i></p>

    arriving at her decision, the motion judge considered that a surety relationship
    generally is one where the surety acts as “constructive jailer” and the person
    on release is in her “constructive custody”. As surety, the mother was to
    ensure Mr. Williams’s appearance in court and his compliance with the terms
    of bail.  However, while the references to jailer or custody reflect the
    origins of surety relationships, as explained in <i>The Law of Bail in Canada</i>, <i>supra</i> at
    281:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>While this view
    of the surety relationship is still acknowledged today, the extent to which
    it is still tenable is a matter of debate.  The constructive jailer model

    part of the nature of the surety relationship, the motion judge was influenced
    by her view that the relationship could not be terminated by Mr. Williams.  However,
    this is not correct. Mr. Williams could terminate the surety order in different
    ways, including by application for a substitute surety.  In addition, his
    mother was entitled to terminate her status as surety if she so desired.  Furthermore,
    the surety relationship was not a permanent one and would end on the disposition
    of the criminal charges.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the facts of this case support the decision of the arbitrator that, while
    the mother had some control over Mr. Williams, he was not under her care.  “Control” is
    not the same as “care”.  The mere fact of control over an individual’s conduct
    does not in all circumstances result in a relationship of dependent care.  The
    primary objective of the surety order in this case was to keep Mr. Williams
    away from his former girlfriend, her house and her friends.  The degree of
    control that rested with the mother for this purpose, and to ensure his appearance
    in court, was not sufficient to make Mr. Williams dependent upon her for
    his care.  To the contrary, subject to the parameters of the bail, Mr. Williams
    came and went from the house at will.  For the most part, he supported himself
    financially, attended to his daily needs, contributed to the household, saw
    to his transportation, maintained his own employment and socialized with
    his own friends.  Mr. Williams was not emotionally or in any other sense
    principally dependent on his mother. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, Mr. Williams’s status as a young adult and his surety relationship
    with his mother were only factors to consider in determining whether he was
    dependent on her for his care.  Other relevant factors include consideration
    of the provision of social, emotional and physical care. See <i>Wawanesa
    Mutual Insurance Co. v. Underwriters, Lloyd’s of London Insurance Co.</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    and <i>R. E. v. Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Co</i>., [2006] O.J. No. 904 (S.C.J.)
    at para. 58. While the mother in this case would likely have provided this
    type of care to Mr. Williams because he was her son and she loved him, she
    did not. This is because he did not need that care.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this appeal, as before the motion judge, the respondent relies heavily on
    the surety relationship as creating a dependency analogous to that of a child
    under sixteen living with his or her parent.  Under s. 2(1) of the regulation,
    a “person who is less than 16 years of age or who requires care because of
    physical or mental incapacity” is deemed to be a “person in need of care”.  In
    my view, this analogy does not apply to dependency for statutory accident
    benefits for two reasons. First, the definition of a person in need of care
    solely informs s. 13 of the regulation, which appears only in Part IV of
    the regulation. Part IV deals exclusively with eligibility for caregiver
    benefits. The legislature chose not to incorporate a similar defined term
    into Part I of the regulation dealing with entitlement to statutory accident
    benefits.  Second, a person under sixteen is often dependent on his or her
    parents for financial and emotional care, as well as day-to-day care.  Mr.
    Williams was not.  Accordingly, I cannot agree that this provision has any
    application to the circumstances of the adult Mr. Williams. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    to hold that a surety order is determinative of dependency for care would
    mean that the insurance policies of all sureties –
    many of whom will not be parents or family members – would be answerable
    for motor vehicle accidents involving a person on release.  By extension,
    such a decision may lead to the result that such persons, being dependants
    of the surety, are entitled to share in any death benefits payable under
    other provisions of the regulation.  Neither of these results could be the
    intention of the legislature. </p>
