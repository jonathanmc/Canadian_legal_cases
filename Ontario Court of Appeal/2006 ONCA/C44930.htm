  <p><b>On appeal from the order of Justice </b><b>William

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>MACFARLAND J.A.:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue raised by this appeal is the interpretation
    of those provisions of the <i>Statutory
    Accident Benefits Schedule – Accidents After December 31, 1993 and Before
    November 1, 1996</i>, O. Reg. 776/93 (the “<i>SABS</i>”)
    that relate to the hourly rates to be used for the calculation of attendant
    care benefits.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from the order of Jenkins J. made
    February 9, 2006.  That order dismissed
    the appellant’s motion brought pursuant to Rule 21.01(1)(a) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> for an order
    dismissing the respondent’s claim for attendant care benefits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge concluded that the respondent was
    entitled to pursue her claim for increased hourly rates for attendant
    care.  The appellant argues that the
    motion judge’s conclusion deprives it of the ability to argue at trial that the
    wording of the legislation precludes the respondent from disputing the hourly
    rates specifically set out in the legislation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent was seriously injured in a motor vehicle
    accident on January 28, 1994.  She was
    sixteen years old at the time. She suffered a severe brain injury, which
    entitled her to attendant care services pursuant to the <i>SABS</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant now concedes that the respondent requires
    attendant care twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week and that she
    meets the definition set out in s. 47(7) of the <i>SABS</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If as a result of the accident, the insured person
    suffers severe brain injuries that cause violent behaviour that may result in
    physical harm to insured person or other persons, the maximum amount payable
    under this section in respect of the insured person is $10,020 per month.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant currently pays the respondent attendant
    care benefits in the sum of $5,606.45 per month.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the hourly rate for attendant
    care to be applied is mandated by law and is not subject to discretion.  It has paid, and continues to pay attendant
    care benefits to the respondent based on Part II or minimum wage hourly rates
    as set out in Form 1 and section 50(10) of the <i>SABS</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent’s position is that she is entitled to be
    paid for necessary services at hourly rates higher than those prescribed in s.
    50(10) up to the maximum permitted under the statute which she agrees is $10,020.00
    per month. The respondent argues that the rates set out in subsection 50(10)
    merely preserve the <i>status quo</i> pending the determination of a dispute in relation to those rates under
    subsection 50(12).</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In its factum the appellant states the issue as whether
    the motion judge erred “in finding that the respondent should be permitted to
    litigate the issue of a reasonable hourly rate for attendant care benefits when
    the hourly rate is governed by regulation.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent states the issue somewhat differently,
    as whether “the respondent can dispute the hourly rate at which attendant care
    benefits are paid”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that although section 47(1) of
    the <i>SABS</i> provides that the respondent
    is entitled to “reasonable expenses incurred” for “services provided by an aide
    or an attendant”, section 47(9) stipulates that the benefits paid under the
    section “… shall be determined in accordance with Form 1 and 50(10).”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Form 1 is a worksheet mandated by statute that is used
    to calculate attendant care benefits. There are three categories of care,
    levels 1, 2 and 3.  Level 1 care is paid
    at the rate of $8.75 per hour, Level 2 at the current minimum hourly wage and
    Level 3 at $14.00 per hour.  Section
    80(1) provides for indexation of every monetary amount payable.  The appellant submits therefore the hourly
    rates are clearly set out in section 50(10) and there is no ambiguity in the
    language used in respect of those rates.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the alternative, the appellant argues that if this
    court finds there is ambiguity between sections 47(1) and 47(9), then it should
    apply the rule of statutory interpretation that provides that the specific
    prevails over the general, as set out in <i>Sullivan
    and Driedger on the Construction of Statutes</i>: “Where two provisions are in
    conflict and one of them deals specifically with the matter in question while
    the other is of general application, the conflict may be avoided by applying
    the specific provision to the exclusion of the more general one.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent argues that the motions judge correctly
    interpreted the legislation when he concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The fact of the matter is that an injured person
    such as the plaintiff who suffers severe brain damage and qualifies under s.
    47(7) for the maximum monthly amount for an Attendant Care Benefits of $10,020
    can never reach that maximum when the rates to be paid for Attendant Care
    Benefits are calculated in accordance with Form 1.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am satisfied that $5000 a month is not adequate
    for the Attendant Care Benefits for the plaintiff.  In fact, the cost of appropriate attendant care
    for the plaintiff probably exceeds $10,020 per month. As a result, I accept the
    plaintiff’s argument that she is entitled to dispute the rates to be paid by
    the defendant insurer for Attendant Care Benefits in accordance with s. 50(12)
    of the legislation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Alternatively, if the legislation is capable of the
    interpretation the appellant advances, it is equally capable of the
    interpretation advanced by respondent, and in the circumstances we should adopt
    the interpretation most beneficial to the insured.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent argues that if she is confined to the
    hourly rates set out in subsection 50(10) she can never reach the maximum for
    her category under 47(7) of $10,020 per month. Given that she requires
    attendant care twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week, the maximum benefit
    is illusory.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The relevant provisions<a

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            (7)       If, as a result of the accident, the

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            (9)       The benefits payable to an insured person

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 50 sets out the procedure whereby a person who
    claims benefits for attendant care undergoes an assessment at a designated
    assessment centre.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>50(8)  After
    conducting the assessment, the person or persons who conducted the assessment
    shall prepare a report in Form 1 and provide a copy of the report to,</p>

    relating to the amount to be paid by the insurer for the provision of services
    referred to in section 47 to the insured person in accordance with sections 279
    to section 283 of the <i>Insurance Act</i>,
    a determination under clause (9)(b) is binding on the insured person and the
    insurer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sections 279 through 283 set out the procedure whereby
    any disputes in relation to entitlement to or the amount of no fault benefits
    to which an insured person is entitled are resolved.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view the interpretation placed on the legislation
    by the appellant must prevail.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is that
    set out by Elmer Driedger in <i>Construction
    of Statutes</i>, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1983) at 87, and adopted
    by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Rizzo
    and Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re)</i>, [1998] 154 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 193 at
    paragraph 21:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Today there is only one principle or approach,
    namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their
    grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the
    object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To suggest that an insured person may dispute the
    hourly rates set out in section 50(10) ignores the mandatory language of the
    section.  In that subsection the
    legislation uses the mandatory term “shall” twice – “the determination under
    clause (9)(b) <i>shall</i> be made in
    accordance with Form 1 and <i>shall</i> be
    based on the following hourly rates for service … .”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view the reasonable meaning to be given to
    subsection 50(12) is that which the insurer concedes, that an insured person is
    free to dispute the number of hours of care that the assessor has found she or he
    is entitled to, or the level into which the particular service has been
    allocated.  In other words, subsection
    50(12) preserves the insured’s right to argue for more hours of care or that
    the required care should be within a higher paying category.  An insured cannot, however, dispute the
    hourly rate for the services set out in 50(10) nor the use of Form 1.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This interpretation respects the language used in the
    regulation and accords with the recommendations made to the government in April
    1993 by the Task Force on Rehabilitation and Long-Term Care Benefits.  The Task Force was created to develop
    regulatory standards sensitive to concerns about both costs of and the need for
    appropriate rehabilitation services. Recommendation 54 made by the Task Force
    specifically recommended that the hourly rates, now embodied in s. 50(10) of
    the Regulation “should” be the ones used by Assessors<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> when considering claims for attendant care cost.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A case very similar to this came before the Ontario
    Financial Services Commission: <i>Alvarez v.
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Liberty Mutual Insurance
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Co.</i>,
    [2001] O.F.S.C.I.D. No. 112; aff’d at [2000] O.F.S.C.I.D. No. 54.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In June 1995, Ms. Alvarez was struck by a motor vehicle
    and sustained a serious brain injury as well as other injuries as a
    result.  Following an assessment in
    January 1999, her monthly attendant care benefit was assessed in the following
    amounts:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            Level 1 care               $   536.94</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>           Level 2 care                 4,020.61</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>           Level 3 care               <u>     970.63</u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>           TOTAL:                      $5,528.18</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In March 2001, Ms. Alvarez’ treating psychologist
    recommended that she be provided with the round-the-clock presence of skilled
    supervisory attendant care professionals with training in the management of
    aggressive behaviours. Like the respondent, Ms. Alvarez was able to establish
    entitlement to attendant care benefits under subsection 47(7) which provides
    for a maximum monthly available of $10,000 plus indexation.  The need for skilled supervisory attendant
    care arose because of the “unpredictable nature of her aggressive outbursts and
    tendencies for self-injurious behaviours.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After noting that subsection 47(9) requires that
    benefits payable to an insured person <i>shall</i> be determined in accordance with Form 1 and subsection 50(10) the arbitrator
    continued:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>15.       Most
    of Ms. Alvarez’ care has been slotted into Level II attendant care. Level II
    care relates to basic supervisory functions and does not mention the highly
    skilled supervisory care which is required by Ms. Alvarez.  However, there is a category in Level II for
    severe brain injuries which is defined as “client lacks ability to respond to
    an emergency or needs custodial care due to changes in behaviour.”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>16.       Although
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Liberty Mutual
    submits that Level III care is restricted to complex health care and hygiene
    functions, Ms. Alvarez submits that skilled supervisory care should have been a
    separate heading under Level III attendant care in Part 3 of Form 1 and was
    omitted through oversight or error.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>17.       In
    Monachino and Liberty Mutual and AXA Home Insurance the Court of Appeal dealt
    with whether parents of a son who was severely injured in a motor vehicle
    accident in 1991 could obtain payment for attendant care provided by them to
    their son. This was a difficult decision but the court found that it must apply
    the statutory language in the Schedule which specified that the expenses must
    be incurred for a professional caregiver. The court ruled: “It appears to me
    that the language of the no-fault schedule is clear and unambiguous … To accept
    the appellant’s interpretation would be to rewrite the statute as opposed to
    applying its clear language.”  This gap
    in the Schedule was remedied subsequently by amendments to the Insurance Act
    effective January 1, 1994.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>18.       I
    acknowledge that there is a gap in the legislation and it appears to be a
    serious oversight that Level III care in Form 1 includes only complex
    physical/health care needs with no category for psychological needs.  However, as with the court in Monachino, I am
    charged with interpreting the legislation and not with amending it.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>19.       It
    would be preferable for the safety of Ms. Alvarez and others if the 24-hour
    skilled supervisory care recommended by Dr. Alyman could be provided and
    compensated at the rates for Level III care.  However, that is not possible due to the manner in which the legislation
    is drafted.  There is no room for
    flexibility when filling out the Form 1.  [Footnotes omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After concluding that Ms. Alvarez did not qualify for
    access funding under either Level I or Level III for the qualified skilled
    supervisory care she required, arbitrator Killoran considered the question
    raised here as to how one in Ms. Alvarez’ position could ever obtain the
    $10,000 amount available under the legislation.  This is the same illusory benefit argument raised by the respondent in
    this case.  Arbitrator Killoran held:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>21.       Ms. Alvarez queried whether it would be
    possible to have more than one attendant providing care and in that fashion
    “stack” benefits available under Level II.  I find that Ms. Alvarez may require additional and separate care
    services due to the nature of her disability. It is possible to “stack”
    attendant care services under the legislation.  For example in Ms. Alvarez’ case, under Level II of Form 1, it is
    possible that two attendants may be compensated simultaneously for her care,
    due to the nature of her disability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the same decision, the arbitrator was called upon to
    consider, as we are, whether the hourly rates set out in subsection 50(10) are
    to be used as fixed rates for the calculation of benefits for attendant care on
    Form 1, or whether they represent minimum rates which the assessor may increase
    up to the relevant cap amount. The arbitrator determined, following the
    reasoning of another arbitrator in a different case,<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a> that the hourly rates set out in 50(10) are fixed rates and there is no
    discretion for an assessor to increase or reduce those rates.  He concluded at para. 29:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is accurate that if one were to multiply the
    rates set out in subsection 50(10) by the number of hours in a week, in the
    case of  24-hour care, the amount payable
    by the insurer would not be the maximum available under subsection 47(5) or
    47(7).  However, if one were to multiply
    the rates by the number and kinds of specialized care that could be offered by
    more than one attendant, as contemplated in the “stacking” scenario, it would
    be possible to attain the maximum available.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I find the reasoning of Arbitrator Killoran persuasive
    and it accords with the interpretation that, in my view, the legislation bears.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result the appeal is allowed.  The disposition of the motion judge is set
    aside and in its place an order will issue declaring that the plaintiff is
    prohibited from contesting the hourly rates payable for services under section
    50(10) of the SABS.</p>

lang=EN-US>The <i>SABS</i> was amended
    effective March 1, 2006 by O. Reg. 26/06. Section 50 was revoked and replaced,
    and a corresponding amendment was made to s. 47(9). A transitional provision
    was also included in the amendments, however, which provides that s. 50 continues
    to apply as it read on February 28, 2006 in respect of a claim for payment of
    an expense under s. 47 if, as in this case, notice was given by either party
    before March 1, 2006 that the insured would be assessed under s. 50. I have
    therefore set out the provisions of the <i>SABS</i> as they apply to this case
    – that is, as they were on February 28, 2006.</span></p>
