style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    and Mrs. Bozzo seek to set aside the order of Justice Farley, dated February
    2, 2006, dismissing their motion to amend their statement of defence in certain
    respects.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the motion judge noted, there has been a long history of litigation between
    the plaintiff and the Bozzos.  An important feature of this story is a second
    mortgage on certain development property in the Brampton area provided to
    Duca Financial Services Credit Union Ltd. by Joco Investments Ltd., and guaranteed
    by Mr. Bozzo.  Mrs. Bozzo is not a guarantor.  The mortgage was in the principal
    amount of $1,200,000 and was registered on January 17, 1990.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    mortgage fell into default in November 1991.  In May 1992, Duca obtained
    judgment against Mr. Bozzo on the guarantee, and after an unsuccessful appeal,
    Mr. Bozzo was petitioned into bankruptcy.  Neither he nor his trustee in
    bankruptcy took any official steps to assert whatever rights Mr. Bozzo might
    have had against Duca, in his capacity as guarantor of the mortgage, in relation
    to the real property which provided security for the debt of the principal
    debtor, Joco.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Duca
    has not recovered on its debt through the bankruptcy proceedings.  Mr. Bozzo
    has been discharged from bankruptcy, but in December 1996, Duca obtained
    an order pursuant to section 38 of the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (“<i>BIA</i>”), entitling it to commence this action.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a>  The pertinent causes of action asserted
    in the statement of claim consist of (a) a claim to set aside an $80,000
    payment made by Tavender Lane Inc. to Mrs. Bozzo on account of some consulting
    work done by Mr. Bozzo for Tavender in relation to a golf course and, (b)
    a claim to set aside a trust declaration providing that fifty-one shares
    of The Abbas Group Inc. (a Bozzo company) in Mr. Bozzo’s name are held in
    trust for Mrs. Bozzo.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal arises because the appellants seek to amend their statement of defence
    to raise issues respecting the sale of the mortgaged premises referred to
    above.  Duca sold the property in 2001, pursuant to an order permitting a
    power of sale, for $2.4 million, an amount insufficient to discharge the
    first mortgage and the Duca second mortgage.  The appellants say this constituted
    an improvident sale.  They wish to amend to allege improvident sale by way
    of defence, as well as <i>de facto</i> foreclosure, which they assert arises
    from certain acts Duca undertook in relation to the property in early 1996
    (“The Improvident Sale/Foreclosure Claims”).  They seek to argue that Duca’s
    recovery in the action, which could never exceed what Mr. Bozzo owed on the
    guarantee, should be reduced by the shortfall created by the improvident
    sale or <i>de facto</i> foreclosure.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice
    Farley dismissed the motion on the basis that the appellants were precluded
    from raising these issues at this time, in this action, on <i>res judicata </i>and
    abuse of process grounds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the decision of the motion judge in the result, but not for the
    reasons on which he relied.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>DISCUSSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Undoubtedly
    the motion judge was of the view that Mr. Bozzo could have, and should have,
    exercised whatever rights he may have in respect of his claim to be protected
    by the mortgage security, either in conjunction with the action on the guarantee
    or in opposition to the granting of the receiving order in the bankruptcy
    proceedings.  He therefore concluded that the appellants were precluded from
    raising such issues at this late stage in the global dispute between the
    parties, and in these proceedings, on <i>res judicata</i>,<i> </i>estoppel
    and abuse of process grounds.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the essential facts upon which the Improvident Sale/Foreclosure Claims are
    based did not arise until after both of the earlier proceedings had taken
    place, and, accordingly, could hardly have formed the basis of an issue determined
    between the parties at those times.  Respectfully, we do not think that the
    doctrines of <i>res judicata</i> or abuse of process provide a basis for
    dismissing the appellants’ motion to amend at this time.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
    the decision to dismiss the motion to amend was the correct one, in our view.  The
    Improvident Sale/Foreclosure Claims cannot provide a defence to the claims
    being made by Duca in this action, nor can they operate as a defence by way
    of set-off.  To the extent that they may give rise to a separate counter-claim,
    they are not Mr. Bozzo’s, but rather the trustee’s, to assert.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    section 38 proceeding under the <i>BIA</i> is brought where a creditor believes
    that an action would be for the benefit of the bankrupt estate but the trustee
    declines to take it.  An order granted under section 38 permits the creditor
    to pursue the action at the creditor’s own expense and to recover for itself
    any benefit derived from the proceeding to the extent of its claim plus costs;
    any surplus obtained belongs to the bankrupt estate: <i>BIA</i>, <i>supra</i>,<i> </i>s.
    38.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    Duca, as plaintiff in this action, is not asserting its claim for the guarantee
    debt owed by Mr. Bozzo.  Rather, it is asserting what would otherwise be
    the trustee’s claim to set aside two transactions – unrelated to the mortgage
    property or the guaranteed debt – and theoretically to recover money or money’s
    worth for the benefit of the estate and the creditors as a whole.  The fact
    that the statutory scheme entitles the section 38 creditor to be paid out
    of the proceeds in priority to other creditors, or that, on the facts of
    this case, there are no other creditors, does not change this scenario.  In
    these circumstances, we do not see how Mr. Bozzo’s claim to be protected
    in relation to the security provided for the loan he guaranteed can give
    rise to any defence to the claims asserted against the defendants in this
    action.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    do we see how the Improvident Sale/Foreclosure Claims could operate by way
    of set-off to the plaintiff’s claim, as argued by Mr. Boswell.  Legal set-off
    cannot apply given the absence of mutual debts.  Moreover, equitable set-off
    cannot apply because the alleged fraudulent preferences arise from transactions
    that are completely different from the mortgage guarantee that gives rise
    to the security-related allegations; clearly they are not so inextricably
    intertwined as to support such a set-off claim: see <i>Holt v. Telford</i>,
    [1987] 2 S.C.R. 193 at 204, 211-212.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    to the extent that the Improvident Sale/Foreclosure Claims could amount to
    a separate counter-claim by Mr. Bozzo against Duca, such a claim is no longer
    Mr. Bozzo’s to assert.  The Improvident Sale/Foreclosure Claims against Duca,
    as creditor, arise out of the general propositions that a guarantor is entitled,
    from the moment of his or her guarantee, to call for the benefit of all securities
    held in respect of the guaranteed debt, if needed, and that a creditor has
    a general obligation to protect and preserve the security and to be in a
    position to return or reassign the security to the debtor or surety on repayment
    of the debt: see <i>Bauer v. Bank of Montreal</i>, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 102 at
    106; <i>First City Capital Ltd. v. Hall</i>, (1993) 11 O.R. (3d) 792 at 795
    (C.A.).  Should the mortgaged property be disposed of by power of sale, the
    mortgagee’s obligation is to account for the proceeds of sale: see Walter
    M. Traub, <i>Falconbridge on Mortgages</i>, 5<span style='font-family:&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>th </span>ed. looseleaf (Aurora: Canada Law Book,
    2004) c. 31 at 31-12 – 31-14; <i>Mortgages Act</i>, R.S.O 1990, c. M.40,
    s. 27.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this context, the right that Mr. Bozzo had to require Duca to obtain fair
    market value if it sold the security constituted a chose in action that passed
    to the trustee on Mr. Bozzo’s bankruptcy.  The later allegedly improvident
    sale may fix the recovery available based on that chose in action, but does
    not create a new chose in action inuring to Mr. Bozzo’s benefit post-bankruptcy.  Any
    claim based upon this chose in action must therefore be asserted by the trustee,
    and not by Mr. Bozzo, unless, of course, Mr. Bozzo can persuade the trustee
    to pursue the Improvident Sale Claims or assign them to him.</p>
