style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is an in person appeal from the disposition of the Ontario Review Board (the “Board”)
    dated August 26, 2005 ordering that the appellant continue to be detained
    at the maximum-security Oak Ridge Division of the Mental Health Centre, Penetanguishene
    (the “Hospital”).  He has been detained there since January 19, 1978, except
    for about a year and a half while he was detained in medium security at the
    Brockville Psychiatric Hospital (from 1982 to 1983) (from which he eloped)
    and some three years in the Barrie Jail (from 1992 to 1995) awaiting trial
    on charges of uttering threats against staff members at the Hospital.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    accordance with his long-standing practice, the appellant refused to appear
    at the hearing of the Board and indicated he did not wish to be represented
    by counsel at the hearing.  The appellant also indicated he did not wish
    to be represented by counsel in this court.  However, with the agreement
    of the Crown, this court appointed <i>amicus curiae</i> to assist in dealing
    with the issues raised by the appellant.  In accordance with this court’s
    order, the <i>amicus curiae</i> filed a factum as well.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted, the appellant has long refused to attend the Board hearings and has
    refused to permit counsel to attend on his behalf.  The <i>amicus curiae</i> pointed
    out that over the course of some 20 previous hearings held by the Board regarding
    the appellant, there are only two references in the record to counsel representing
    him (once in 1994 and once in 1999), and no reference that establishes that
    he was ever personally present at an annual review. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the commencement of the hearing on August 25, 2005, the Board expressed concern
    about the long history of proceedings in the absence of the appellant.  Dr.
    Malcolmson, a hospital psychiatrist, expressed his opinion that the appellant’s
    unwillingness to attend the Board hearing was an attitudinal issue, and that
    there was no psychiatric or physical illness to explain his decision.  Dr.
    Malcolmson also said that the appellant was not incompetent to decide whether
    to attend the hearing.  Counsel for the Crown and for the Hospital took the
    position that the Board should proceed in the appellant’s absence.  After
    recessing to consider the matter and noting its express statutory authority
    to do so, the Board decided to proceed in the appellant’s absence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is unnecessary to review the appellant’s long and ongoing record of engaging
    in violent and threatening behaviour in detail.  It is worth noting that
    the appellant’s criminal record dates back to 1963 and that his most serious
    conviction was for manslaughter.  He had bludgeoned his aunt to death with
    a rolling pin in 1966 and was sentenced to 12 years incarceration.  The index
    offence which led to his detention at the Hospital in 1978 was possession
    of a weapon for a dangerous purpose.  He was found standing on a street corner
    near the home of a psychometrist he met in jail with a 12 gauge pump action
    shotgun, a .357 snub nose Magnum, a box of 12 gauge magnum shells, handcuffs
    and a large quantity in cash.  The appellant was transferred to the Barrie
    Jail in 1992 after being charged with four counts of uttering threats against
    hospital staff members.  He pled guilty to these charges.  Finally, it must
    be noted that the appellant’s threatening behaviour has been continuous.  On
    July 27, 2005, just two weeks before the Board hearing, he left a telephone
    message menacing a hospital staff member.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence before the Board was unequivocal that the appellant was a dangerous
    person from whom the public had to be protected.  The Administrator’s Report
    stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The Clinical
    Team is of the opinion that Mr. LePage’s risk factors, and in particular
    his history of violence including murder and indecent assault, continue to
    underscore the necessity for his continued detention in a highly structured
    and supervised hospital setting in order to ensure the safety of the public,
    including staff and co-patients.  He remains explosive at times in response
    to external stressors, displays evidence of rigidity, disregard for others,
    and if left unsupervised, the evidence suggests that he will insist that
    others do as he wishes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Board noted that the following summary of the expert evidence taken from
    the previous year’s Board Reasons continued to apply:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>There has been
    no variation in the opinion of the many clinicians who have opined on Mr.
    LePage’s file and his diagnosis and the prospects of successful treatment
    of the accused’s major mental disorder.  Dr. Malcolmson stated that Mr. LePage
    has no insight into his illness.  Further, the doctor noted with alarm that
    the index offence is in the doctor’s words “mild” when compared with the
    observed research that Mr. LePage continues to expend in preparation for
    the perpetration of threats of death, threats of violence and intimidation
    that continues routinely at Oak Ridge by this accused.  In the doctor’s view
    Mr. LePage’s serious intention to physically harm staff and co-patients by
    death threats is very real.  The doctor could detect no prospect that the
    accused will ever change with respect to this type of disturbing misconduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    assessment of the appellant’s condition and the danger he poses to others
    has been unchanging.  This is illustrated by the fact that Dr. Malcolmson,
    in his testimony before the Board in 2005, endorsed as still applicable the
    following assessments of the appellant’s condition as early as 1991.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Consultation Report of Dr. McDonald dated December 19, 1991 noted:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I do not wish
    to be unduly dramatic.  I am aware there are many patients in this facility
    who must be regarded as potentially dangerous.  I am of the opinion however,
    that this man stands out among them.  He is extremely angry, is untroubled
    by moral qualms, and he seethes with anger and resentment, a desire for vindictive
    retaliation at those he perceives to frustrate his desires.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his Consultation Note dated June 5, 1995, Dr. Menuck said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Only the identity
    of his next victim(s) and the timing of his next attack are in question.  He
    should be managed with extreme caution in secure surroundings.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Since Mr. LePage
    presents clear risks to other people because of an identified mental disorder,
    he is certifiable under the Ontario Mental Health Act.  He is not approachable
    and will not recover spontaneously.  Therefore he will remain dangerous and
    certifiable for the foreseeable future.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    1995 assessment note of Dr. Jones said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In light of
    this patient’s threats and his threatening, provocative behaviour over the
    past years in this facility, there is, in my opinion, no evidence that would
    convince a reasonable person that this man has changed in any significant
    way since the days when he was found insane in the first place.  Not surprisingly,
    I have very grave concerns about releasing this man to a less secure facility...
    the prospects are frightening.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Such
    assessments of the appellant’s condition have resulted in the Hospital Administrator
    recommending year in and year out that the Board’s detention of the appellant
    be continued. In the disposition under appeal, the Board held that based
    on the evidence before it, the appellant continued to suffer from a major
    mental disorder, that he presented an extreme and substantial threat to the
    safety of the public and that he refused treatment. For those reasons, the
    Board concluded that continued detention was the least onerous and restrictive
    disposition in the circumstances. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not be concerned with the Board’s disposition, repeating its previous
    dispositions and continuing the detention of a dangerous accused, but for
    two features of the appellant’s circumstances: first, he is receiving no
    treatment at the Hospital, and second, the Board has repeatedly reached its
    dispositions on the basis of material introduced only by the Hospital. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Malcolmson, the appellant’s attending psychiatrist for the last five years,
    explained that the reason the appellant is receiving no treatment is because
    he has been completely unwilling to participate in any therapy or treatment
    for many years.  His refusal of treatment is so adamant that he does not
    enter rooms on the ward where treatments are undertaken.  He has threatened
    legal action against a hospital staff member who casually asked him “how
    are you doing?” because he interpreted it to be a clinical question.  Dr.
    Malcolmson described the level of interaction he had with the appellant over
    the previous year as “zero.”  He explained that he had been advised in the
    strongest terms to stay clear of the appellant.  He does not even say good
    morning to him or acknowledge him in the corridor.  Dr. Malcolmson testified
    that he was the appellant’s psychiatrist “theoretically.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his oral submissions to the court, the appellant took issue with the Hospital’s
    suggestion recorded in the 1997 and 1998 dispositions of the Board that his
    refusal to participate in therapeutic programs is because he has always denied
    having a mental illness.  He stated that he acknowledged he was mentally
    ill in a letter dated July 14, 1987 to the unit director.  Further, alluding
    to his refusal to participate in Board hearings being a protest to a system
    which relies on inaccurate documentation, he took issue with the suggestion
    that he has failed to provide documents to support his long-standing position
    that there are errors in the documents relied upon by the Board.  He stated
    that in 1999 the addendum to the Hospital Administrator’s report acknowledged
    that counsel acting for him tendered documents on his behalf, albeit without
    proper notice.</p>

    appellant requests an order of this court transferring him <span lang=EN-US>to
    a medium secure facility “to engage in a complete comprehensive psychiatric

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>amicus
      curiae</i> submitted that in the circumstances the Board had a duty to
      inquire into the reasons for the appellant’s long-standing refusal to participate
      in the annual review of his detention either personally or through counsel,
      and his refusal of treatment.  The Board, it was submitted, was under a
      duty to make orders that would facilitate or stimulate treatment opportunities
      for the appellant.  The Board should have ordered an independent assessment
      of the appellant’s situation to be carried out at a medium secure institution.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown took the position that the appeal was moot, and that, in any event,
    there was a clear evidentiary basis upon which the Board could decide to
    proceed in the appellant’s absence.  The Crown further submitted that “this
    was not a situation of a true ‘treatment impasse’”; rather, the appellant
    had simply been refusing for many years to participate in any treatment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    main issue to be determined is whether, in the face of the appellant’s persistent
    refusal to participate in Board hearings and in any treatment at the Hospital,
    the Board was required to do more than it did in order to meet its inquisitorial
    duties.  As a preliminary issue, it must be determined if this appeal is
    moot.  While <i>amicus curiae</i> raised the issue of reasonable apprehension
    of bias in its factum, this was abandoned at the hearing of the appeal.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Mootness</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the Crown submits, this appeal is in fact moot because the Board held another
    review hearing on July 25, 2006 and issued another disposition on August
    2, 2006.  Therefore the August 26, 2005 disposition under appeal has expired.  However,
    we were advised that the 2006 hearing and disposition of the Board largely
    mirrored the 2005 disposition under appeal.  The appellant again refused
    to participate in the hearing and the Board proceeded in his absence and
    continued the disposition already in place.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
    issues put into controversy by this appeal continue to be alive.  Given the<i> Criminal
    Code</i>’s requirement that a not criminally responsible (“NCR”) accused’s
    detention be reviewed annually, as a practical matter, a Board order will
    have expired or will soon expire by the time any appeal from it is heard.
    In <i>Borowski v. Attorney-General of Canada </i>(1989), 47 C.C.C. (3d) 1
    at 15 (S.C.C.), Sopinka J. stated: “<span class=loose><span lang=EN>In order
    to ensure that an important question which might independently evade review
    be heard by the court, the mootness doctrine is not applied strictly.” </span></span> Further,
    in <i>Mazzei v. British Columbia (Adult Forensic Psychiatric Services, Director) </i>(2006),
    206 C.C.C. (3d) 161, the Supreme Court held at para. 15 that orders of the
    British Columbia Review Board were “capable of repetition, yet evasive of
    review” and that it should exercise its discretion to hear the moot appeal.  For
    these reasons, I conclude that this court should exercise its discretion
    to hear this appeal.  </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
      Board’s inquisitorial duties </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case the appellant is not receiving treatment and there is no prospect
    that he will receive treatment or that his situation will change on the basis
    of the information currently before the Board.  It is not clear what specific
    actions might conceivably lead to a break in the impasse, or even that the
    impasse can be broken. However, after 28 years, this case had reached the
    point where it was incumbent on the Board to consider making further inquiry.  As
    the Supreme Court of Canada explained in <i>Winko v. British Columbia (Forensic
    Psychiatric Institute)</i> (1999), 135 C.C.C. (3d) 129, the regime under
    Part XX.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> departs from the traditional adversarial
    model.  The system is inquisitorial.  The Board bears the burden of reviewing
    all relevant evidence on both sides of the case.  The Board has the duty
    to search out and consider evidence not only favouring restricting the NCR
    accused, but also evidence in his or her favour “regardless of whether the
    NCR accused is even present” (para. 54).  As the court said at para. 55:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>As a practical
    matter, it is up to the court or Review Board to gather and review all available
    evidence pertaining to the four factors set out in s. 672.54... The court
    and the Review Board have the ability to do this.  They can cause records
    and witnesses to be subpoenaed, including experts to study the case and provide
    the information they require.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
    recently, in <i>Mazzei</i>, <i>supra</i>, the Supreme Court stated at para.
    7 that the Board has “the power to bind hospital authorities and to impose
    binding conditions regarding or supervising (but not prescribing or imposing)
    medical treatment for an NCR accused.”  In that case, the Supreme Court found
    that the Board had jurisdiction to order the Hospital director to undertake
    a comprehensive review of the NCR accused’s diagnosis and current treatment
    so as to develop “an integrated treatment approach which considers the current
    treatment impasse and the accused’s reluctance to become an active participant
    in his rehabilitation.”</p>

line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, after 28 years it is clear that the high level of danger the appellant
    poses to the public is unchanging, he is receiving no treatment, his attending
    psychiatrist describes his role as “theoretical”, and the institution has
    no treatment plan with prospects of leading to a different situation. Rather
    than simply recapitulating the static situation and ordering that the appellant
    continue to be detained, an exercise of the Board’s inquisitorial role may
    have resulted in the appellant’s continued detention being subject to a condition
    ordering a comprehensive review of his situation as in <i>Mazzei</i>. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is nothing in the record to indicate that the Board adverted to the inquisitorial
    nature of its process. In the particular facts of this case it was an error
    of law for the Board to fail to recognize its inquisitorial role and to consider
    making further inquiries. Consequently, the resulting disposition was “based
    on a wrong decision on a question law” and appellate intervention is appropriate
    under s. 672.78(1)(b). Had the Board’s reasons explained why it decided not
    to make further inquiry in this case, the court would have to show deference
    to that decision. It and the resulting disposition would have been reviewable
    on a reasonableness standard under s. 672.78(1)(a).</p>

    I would allow the appeal and order a new hearing. While I would leave to
    the Board the question of how best to pursue its duty of inquiry, it seems
    to me that the Board would have benefited by appointing <i>amicus curiae</i> at
    the hearing, as the Board has done in other cases: see for example <i>Condruz
    (Re), </i>[2005] O.R.B.D. No. 1786 and <i>Schutzman (Re)</i>, [2005] O.R.B.D.
    No. 1841. </p>

    Board’s jurisdiction to appoint <i>amicus curiae</i> was contested in this
    appeal. Section 672.5(8) provides as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>If an accused
    is not represented by counsel, the court or Review Board shall, either before
    or at the time of the hearing, assign counsel to act for any accused</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(a) who has been found unfit to stand trial; or </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(b) wherever the interests of justice require.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown submitted that this section does not provide authority to the Board
    to appoint <i>amicus curiae</i> as it contemplates assigning counsel “to
    act for any accused.” Further, the Crown submitted that it would be futile
    to appoint counsel for the appellant given that he has clearly indicated
    that he will not communicate with any counsel assigned to him.  Rather, the
    Crown submits the choices the appellant makes in exercising his personal
    autonomy must be respected.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the words of s. 672.5(8) do not preclude the Board from appointing <i>amicus
    curiae</i> when the interests of justice so require.  I would not adopt an
    unduly technical approach to the question.  Certainly, <i>amicus curiae</i> appointed
    by the court have no solicitor-client relationship with the accused, and
    may be described as counsel to the court.  However, the role of <i>amicus
    curiae</i> is not strictly defined and continues to evolve.  One of the roles
    of <i>amicus curiae</i> has been recognized as being an assistant to the
    court when “there is a failure to present the issues (as, for example, where
    one side of the argument has not been presented to the Court)”: <span class=hit><i><span lang=EN>Clark</span></i></span><span class=bold><i><span

class=loose><span lang=EN> (H.C.J.).  When NCR accused are involved, there is
    an elevated possibility that all issues may not be presented. In my view, <i>amicus
    curiae</i> may be appointed by the Board and assigned the role of presenting
    the issues favouring the accused which otherwise might not be raised. I am
    satisfied that an <i>amicus curiae</i> who is assigned this role may be said
    to “act for the accused”.   </span></span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    I do not think that appointing <i>amicus curiae</i> to represent the interests
    of the appellant could have been regarded as inevitably futile.  The appellant’s
    past refusals to communicate with any counsel assigned to him may not necessarily
    predict his future behaviour.  As the <i>amicus curiae</i> on appeal pointed
    out, he may well communicate with and instruct counsel if one were appointed.  It
    is notable that <i>amicus curiae</i> was appointed to assist with this appeal
    contrary to the appellant’s wishes, yet it appears he has co-operated with <i>amicus
    curiae</i> in the preparation and presentation of this appeal. </p>

line-height:normal;'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if the appellant refuses to cooperate, <i>amicus curiae</i> has a role to
    play both in representing his interests and in assisting the Board.  If indeed
    the appellant has refused to participate in Board hearings because he believes
    that the Board is operating on the basis on faulty information, <i>amicus
    curiae</i> could have reviewed documents the appellant attempted to place
    before the Board in 1999, and if they were relevant, could have introduced
    them in a procedurally correct manner.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, I would allow the appeal.  The 2005 disposition no longer
    has any operative effect as it has been overtaken by the Board’s 2006 disposition,
    but as the procedure followed on that disposition mirrored what occurred
    in 2005, I would order the Board to conduct a new hearing under s. 672.82
    in accordance with these reasons as soon as practically possible. </p>
