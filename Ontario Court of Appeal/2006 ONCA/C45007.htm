  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the disposition
      order of the Ontario Review Board dated September 14, 2005.</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals, on various grounds, the September 14, 2005 disposition
    order of the Ontario Review Board denying his request for a transfer from
    the maximum secure Oakridge Division of the Penetanguishene Mental Health
    Centre (the “hospital”) to a medium secure facility.  In our opinion, it
    is necessary for the disposition of this appeal to address only one of the
    grounds of appeal advanced by the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the Board’s refusal to receive a report prepared by
    the appellant’s expert, Dr. Ronald Langevin, a forensic psychologist, for
    the purpose of the September 2005 hearing prevented the Board from conducting
    the inquiry mandated by  s. 672.54 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985,
    c. C-46 in respect of the appellant.  In the unusual circumstances of this
    case, we agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    672.54 of the Code provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>672.54  Where a court or Review Board makes
    a disposition pursuant to subsection 672.45(2) or section 672.47, it shall,
    taking into consideration the need to protect the public from dangerous persons,
    the mental condition of the accused, the reintegration of the accused into
    society and the other needs of the accused, make one of the following dispositions
    that is the least onerous and least restrictive to the accused:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>where a verdict of not
    criminally responsible on account of mental disorder has been rendered in
    respect of the accused and, in the opinion of the court or Review Board,
    the accused is not a significant threat to the safety of the public, by order,
    direct that the accused be dis-charged absolutely;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>by order, direct that the
    accused be discharged subject to such conditions as the court or Review Board
    considers appropriate; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>by order, direct that the
    accused be detained in custody in a hospital, subject to such conditions
    as the court or Review Board considers appropriate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    672.54 thus obliged the Board, when fashioning a disposition in respect of
    the appellant’s transfer request, to consider: (1) the need to protect the
    public from the appellant, (2) the mental condition of the appellant, (3)
    the reintegration of the appellant into society, and (4) the appellant’s
    other needs, for the purpose of arriving at a disposition that was the least
    onerous and least restrictive to the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, at a pre-hearing conference held in December 2004 to discuss the
    appellant’s outstanding annual review, it was determined that time would
    be afforded to the appellant to permit him to consult with Dr. Langevin for
    the purpose of obtaining his opinion, in the form of an expert report, to
    be used at the hearing.  The hearing, therefore, was scheduled for April
    2005.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the hearing commenced on April 25, 2005, the appellant’s counsel requested
    an adjournment in order to obtain Dr. Langevin’s report, which he described
    as “very, very important” to the appellant’s position.  He advised the Board
    that Dr. Langevin’s report had been delayed due to difficulties in obtaining
    legally-aided funding to consult with Dr. Langevin.  He filed a letter with
    the Board from Dr. Langevin dated April 23, 2005, in which Dr. Langevin confirmed
    his willingness to try to work within the 20 hour limit of consultation time
    approved for funding by the legal aid authorities, and his commitment to
    have his report prepared by the first week of June, 2005.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Board granted the adjournment request in part, by determining to hear the
    first witness for the hospital and to then adjourn the hearing to permit
    the appellant to obtain the desired expert report.  In its reasons in support
    of its adjournment ruling, the Board stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   Mr. Doan [counsel for the appellant at the hearing]
    was then asked what sort of a report he anticipated receiving from the doctor.  He
    replied that in his opinion the report would be a favourable one and would
    support his client’s position; again, that the examination and the report
    were essential to his client’s case.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   He was then asked what matter or matters, if
    any, were not in issue at this hearing.  He indicated that everything was
    in issue, that is to say, the question of significant risk was as much in
    issue as was the question related to least onerous and least restrictive
    disposition; that such being the case he repeated that the report of Doctor
    Langevin was essential to his case.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   We recessed to consider whether or not to grant
    the request for adjournment either in whole or in part.  We came to the unanimous
    conclusion that, given all of the circumstances, to deny the request for
    adjournment in it’s [<i>sic</i>] entirety would be grossly unfair to the
    accused.  Her psychologist had made a firm commitment; the delay would be
    minimal given when it would be that his report would be available, and the
    report was essential to her position on both issues of concern.  We were
    of the further unanimous view, however, that it would be more appropriate
    to hear whatever evidence the hospital and the Crown wished to call, and
    especially the evidence of Doctor Hucker, and then adjourn the balance of
    the hearing for conclusion when the Langevin report was made available.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    appears from these comments, counsel for the appellant indicated to the Board
    that he anticipated that Dr. Langevin’s report would be
    “favourable” to the appellant and that the report would relate to two core
    matters in dispute: first, the question of the risk posed by the appellant
    and second, the question of what would constitute the least onerous and least
    restrictive disposition for the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    of these issues were mandatory components of the inquiry that the Board was
    required to undertake pursuant to s. 672.54 of the Code.  The Board expressly
    held that Dr. Langevin’s report was “essential” to the appellant’s position
    on these issues.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ultimately,
    the hearing was adjourned on consent of all parties after hearing part of
    the evidence of one witness, to recommence on September 12, 2005.  We note
    that, although the members of the Board were available to reconvene in June
    2005, the hospital’s medical witnesses were not available then.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the hearing resumed on September 12, 2005, first the appellant and then his
    counsel sought to file Dr. Langevin’s report with the Board.  The Board,
    by then newly constituted, declined to receive or consider the report because
    it had not been produced in a timely fashion in accordance with the Board’s
    rules of procedure.  The appellant’s counsel, however, had explained to the
    Board that the delay in furnishing the report was again occasioned by funding
    difficulties experienced with the legal aid authorities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, the appellant was deprived of the opportunity to present his
    expert evidence on two key factors that the Board was obliged to consider
    under s. 672.54 of the Code.  Nor did the Board have the benefit of this
    evidence when crafting a disposition in accordance with its statutorily mandated
    task under s. 672.54.  As we have said, this was evidence that the Board,
    differently constituted, had earlier ruled was
    “essential” to the appellant’s position on these issues and, hence, apparently
    relevant to the Board’s deliberations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    September 14, 2005, the Board made the disposition order now under appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are sympathetic to the Board’s need to ensure adherence by all parties to
    its rules of procedure in order to facilitate the orderly and fair conduct
    of Board hearings.  However, on this record, we conclude that the Board’s
    failure to accommodate, in some appropriate fashion, the appellant’s efforts
    to tender Dr. Langevin’s report was an error.  Such accommodation was clearly
    possible under the Board’s rules.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fact that the appellant could have sought to tender such evidence at a subsequent
    annual review hearing, or at an earlier future hearing convened at his request
    in the discretion of the Board, does not detract from the importance of this
    evidence to the Board’s inquiry at the appellant’s 2005 annual review hearing.  Nor
    does the possibility that the Board, upon consideration of Dr. Langevin’s
    evidence, ultimately might reject his opinion, or otherwise discount his
    evidence, displace the significance of the report at the September 2005 hearing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under
    the Code and the Board’s own rules, the Board’s hearings are designed to
    be informal and inquisitorial in nature to ensure that the Board is positioned
    to consider all available and admissible information bearing upon the factors
    set out in s. 672.54.  Dr. Langevin’s report was both available and relevant.  On
    the Board’s own findings, it was critical to the appellant’s position on
    the central issues in dispute including, importantly, the risk assessment
    to be conducted by the Board regarding the appellant.  In the circumstances,
    therefore, the Board’s disposition cannot stand.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s 2006 annual review hearing is now overdue.  It has been postponed,
    apparently on consent of the parties, pending the outcome of this appeal.  We
    would expect, therefore, that the 2006 review hearing will be convened promptly
    to consider the appellant’s present circumstances and that the appellant
    will be permitted at that hearing, if so advised, to tender Dr. Langevin’s
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons given, the appeal is allowed and the disposition order of the
    Board dated September 14, 2005 is set aside.</p>
