  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from two orders of
      Justice David Nadeau of the Superior Court of Justice dated February 10,
      2006 and February 13, 2006.</span></h4>
  <h2>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants’ primary argument is that the injunction should not have been
    granted because there was a protocol agreed to by the Union and the respondent
    which the police were successfully applying, so that reasonable efforts to
    obtain police assistance had been successful in ensuring that any obstruction
    to entry to the road leading to the respondent’s work site had been agreed
    to.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However
    the trial judge found that no such agreement was proven by the appellant.  This
    finding of fact was one for which there was a clear evidentiary basis.  The
    respondent flatly denied that it had made any such agreement.  While there
    was also evidence to the opposite effect, it was undoubtedly open to the
    trial judge to make the finding he did.  It does not represent palpable and
    overriding error, and absent that, it is not open to this court to retry
    his finding of fact.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge thus proceeded on the basis that the Union imposed a one hour
    delay for each entering vehicle, and that the police were left to attempt
    to secure compliance with that time limit. He concluded that this amounted
    to unlawful obstruction of access and in addition, requiring constant attendance
    by the police at this remote location was unreasonable.  Thus excessive efforts
    to obtain police assistance had been undertaken and even then obstruction
    of lawful entry could not be prevented.  In these circumstances we can see
    no error in the conclusion of the trial judge that s. 102(3) of the <i>Courts
    of Justice</i> <i>Act</i> was satisfied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning
    to the <i>R.J.R-MacDonald</i> factors, the appellant does not contest the “serious
    issue to be tried” consideration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    to irreparable harm, we see no basis to interfere with the finding of the
    trial judge.  The Union was found to be inflicting unlawful conduct on the
    respondent, preventing it from carrying on its winter operations, which could
    not simply be made up once winter passed.  This is not compensable in damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    did the trial judge err in finding the balance of convenience to favour the
    respondent, given the conduct he found and the absence of an agreed protocol.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also contests the scope of the order. However, that is a quintessential
    exercise of judicial discretion and no basis has been shown for us to interfere
    with it, particularly given the conclusion that requiring constant attendance
    of the police in this remote location was unreasonable and that this would
    have been necessary to apply an order sanctioning stopping that was more
    time limited than one hour.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lastly,
    the respondent is content that the order be modified to remove the Union
    as a party so that the order is only against Nathalie Belair in a representative
    capacity.  The fact that the order was originally sought against her in her
    personal capacity caused the appellant no prejudice and the representative
    order should stand.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subject
    to the removal of the Union as a named party to the order, the appeal is
    dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each
    side asked for $15,000.00 in costs if successful.  In the circumstances,
    costs are to the respondent fixed at $15,000.00 inclusive of disbursements
    and G.S.T.</p>
