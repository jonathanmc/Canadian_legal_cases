      the early morning hours, C.N. was the driver of a van.  He was accompanied
      by three friends.  They spotted two young men, M.F. and J.T., on the street.  One
      of the passengers taunted the pedestrians.  The van made a U-turn and as
      it passed the young men a second time C.N. accused M.F. of being a racist
      skinhead.  Almost simultaneously, C.N. recognized M.F. as the person who
      had been involved in a fight with his younger brother approximately a year
      and a half earlier.  C.N. and M.F. apparently knew each other in any event
      since they had previously lived on the same street in Ottawa.</span></p>

      them.  The group surrounded M.F. and told him that they were going to kill
      him.  M.F. produced a can of pepper spray and sprayed C.N. in the face.  The
      other members of C.N.’s group immediately attacked M.F., punching and kicking
      him in the upper body and face.</span></p>

      leg, a 5.5 centimeter cut on the outside of his right thigh, a broken nose,
      a bruise on the left elbow, extensive bruising and cuts to the top and

      the sentence hearing, the matter was designated, on consent, as a serious
      violent offence.  This opened the door to the possibility of a custodial
      sentence being imposed on C.N., and removed the possibility of a deferred
      custody and supervision order.</span></p>

      months secure custody followed by 12 months probation or, alternatively,
      to 9 months open custody plus two years probation.  The defence sought
      a sentence of two years probation, the maximum probation permitted under
      the <i>Youth Criminal Justice Act</i> (“<i>YCJA</i>”).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      youth court judge wrote comprehensive reasons for sentence.  He reviewed
      C.N.’s personal circumstances, including his supportive family.  There
      were many letters written in support of C.N., including from his parents,
      brother, sister, two cousins, two uncles, former and present employers,
      and former high school vice&#8209;principal and guidance counsellor.  The
      youth court judge gleaned from these letters that C.N. “is generally described
      in these documents as a polite, courteous and respectful young man who
      has strong family support.”  However, the judge also noted that since the
      incident C.N. had “admitted to violating his recognizance by consuming
      alcohol and damaging property.”</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      youth court judge briefly reviewed three cases, two from Manitoba and one
      from British Columbia.  He then carefully considered the relevant provisions
      of the <i>YCJA</i>.  He recognized, correctly, that s.&nbsp;39(1)(a) made
      a custodial sentence a possibility because C.N. had committed a violent
      offence, but that, pursuant to s.&nbsp;39(2), he should impose such a sentence
      only if there were no reasonable alternatives to custody in order to fulfil
      the purpose and principles of sentencing in s.&nbsp;38.</span></p>

      mitigating circumstances:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'><u><span
lang=EN-US>AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCES</span></u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In terms of application of those
      principles to the case before, I will deal firstly with the aggravating
      circumstances.  The first aggravating circumstance the court finds is the
      element of pursuit by C.N. and his accomplices towards M.F.; secondly,
      there is the physical and psychological harm done to the victim; there
      is also the use of a weapon; there were the two breaches of his release
      conditions by youth; and also, the negative peer association that preceded
      and accompanied the event.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'><u><span
lang=EN-US>MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES</span></u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In terms of the mitigating circumstances,
      there is the plea of guilty.  C.N. appears to very remorseful; he read
      a letter of apology in open court to the victim, which the court found
      to be very sincere.  He comes from a very supportive family and his legal
      jeopardy was not hidden from his extended family.  C.N. has been attending
      counselling even prior to today’s sentencing.  He has realistic career
      goals which he is pursuing at Community College.  He has a strong work
      ethic.  He has gained insight into his behaviour and he is motivated to
      change his behaviour.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      youth court judge then reached his conclusion:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>After carefully considering the
      extensive sentencing material before me, I am satisfied that, notwithstanding
      the serious and violent nature of this offence, there is a reasonable alternative
      to custody in the case before me.</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, the
      youth court judge sentenced C.N. to probation for two years, the maximum
      permitted under the <i>YCJA</i>.  He imposed 14 conditions, including the
      requirements that C.N. live with his parents, abstain from the consumption
      of alcohol and intoxicants, and comply with a curfew of 11:00 p.m.&#8209;7:00
      a.m. unless accompanied by a parent or other adult family member or unless
      approval has been obtained from his youth worker.</span></p>

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>D.        <u>ANALYSIS</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      case law is clear.  Sentences imposed by trial judges are entitled to great
      deference from appeal courts.  A sentence can be overturned only if it
      is
    “clearly unreasonable” or “demonstrably unfit”: see <i>R. v. Shropshire</i> (1995),
    102 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at para.&nbsp;46 (S.C.C.) and <i>R. v. M. (C.A.) </i>(1996),
    105 C.C.C. (3d) 327 at para.&nbsp;90 (S.C.C.).  The high bar created by these
    formulations of the standard of review is raised even higher in this appeal
    because the youth court judge delivered comprehensive reasons dealing with
    the offence, the offender and his circumstances, the victim, the key provisions
    of the relatively new <i>YCJA</i>, and some case law.  The youth court judge’s
    reasons are far removed from any <i>Sheppard</i> concern relating to the
    sufficiency reasons: see <i>R. v. Sheppard</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869.  Finally,
    it must always be borne in mind that a principal purpose giving rise to the
    enactment of the <i>YCJA</i> was to reduce over&#8209;reliance on custodial
    sentences for young offenders: see<i> R. v. D.(C.)</i>; <i>R. v. K.(C.D.)</i> (2005),
    203 C.C.C. (3d) 449 at para.&nbsp;49 (S.C.C.).</span></p>

      spite of this jurisprudential context, which I take very seriously, I have

      my view, the sentence of two years probation was not, <i>per</i> s.&nbsp;38(2)(c),
      proportionate to the seriousness of the offence and the degree of responsibility
      of C.N. for the offence.  I reach this conclusion for several reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
      and most importantly, C.N. committed a particularly serious and violent
      crime.  The charge was aggravated assault, the designation of the crime
      was a serious violent crime.  In this case, the words aggravated, serious
      and violent are an entirely accurate descriptor of C.N.’s conduct.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>C.N.
      was 17 years old on the night in question.  He used a weapon – a box cutter – to
      slash and stab a young man.  His violent conduct was sustained and cowardly.  C.N.
      stabbed and slashed his victim several times and he did so while M.F. was
      utterly defenseless, pinned to the ground by three of C.N.’s friends.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
      C.N. committed the crime with a group of friends.  The incident was a ‘swarming’ type
      incident that is of great concern to the community.  The hallmarks of swarming
      incidents are sudden, unprovoked and violent attacks by large numbers of
      people on one or a small number of victims.  It is appropriate to use the
      word ‘cowardly’
    a second time to describe C.N.’s conduct.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third,
      although C.N. apologized to M.F. and told the court that he had made poor
      choices of friends, it is important to note that on the night in question
      C.N. was the ringleader.  He drove the van, he engaged in the taunting,
      he hid in the bushes and jumped out at M.F. and J.T., and he – <i>alone</i> –used
      a weapon in the vicious attack on M.F.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fourth,
      the effects of the attack on M.F. were devastating.  He was seriously injured,
      especially as a result of the wounds inflicted by C.N.’s box cutter.  He
      also suffered acute psychological trauma.  In his victim impact statement
      he described “re&#8209;occurring nightmares” and
    “fears of being murdered”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fifth,
      the youth court judge noted that C.N. admitted to violating his recognizance
      while awaiting the sentence hearing by consuming alcohol and damaging property.</span></p>

      a recent decision, <i>R. v. R.E.W.</i> (2006), 79 O.R. (3d) 1, this court
      upheld a sentence of six months secure custody and two years probation
      for a young person convicted of two counts of being an accessory after
      the fact to murder.  Near the end of his judgment, Rosenberg J.A. summarized
      his conclusion in this fashion, at paras.&nbsp;50 and 52:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, this is one of the clearest of cases
    for which a custodial disposition is the only reasonable response.  I can
    see no other disposition that would be proportional to the seriousness of
    the offence and the degree of responsibility of the appellant for that offence.  A
    custodial disposition is also the only sentence that would promote a sense
    of responsibility in the appellant and an acknowledgment of the harm done
    to the victims and the community.  A custodial disposition is also consistent
    with the relevant factors set out in s. 38(3) (i.e. those factors that focus
    on the circumstances of the offence).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Notwithstanding the importance placed on rehabilitation
    and the need to consider alternatives to custody, I am satisfied that nothing
    other than a custodial disposition is consistent with the purpose and principles
    set out in s. 38 and s. 3 of the <i>YCJA</i> in this case.  Any other disposition
    would undermine public confidence in the youth criminal justice system.</p>

    would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal.  Pursuant to s.&nbsp;42(2)(n)
    of the <i>YCJA</i>, I would make a custody and supervision order of nine
    months consisting of six months to be served in open custody and three months
    to be served under supervision in the community.  Pursuant to s.&nbsp;42(2)(k)
    of the <i>YCJA</i>, I would further order that, following completion of this
    period of open custody and supervision, C.N. be placed on probation for a
    period of six months on the same terms as those ordered by the youth court
    judge.  </p>
