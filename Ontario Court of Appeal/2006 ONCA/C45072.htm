  <h2>ENDORSEMENT</h2>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals the motion judge’s decision to grant the respondent insurer
    summary judgment under the provisions of s. 258 of the <i>Insurance Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8 for reimbursement of settlement monies paid by the insurer
    to the plaintiff, who sued the appellant in negligence seeking damages for
    property and personal injury losses arising from a motor vehicle accident
    in which the appellant was driving the plaintiff’s car with her permission.  The
    plaintiff’s insurer is the respondent insurance company.  The appellant was
    an insured under the plaintiff’s policy because he drove her car with her
    permission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the insurer successfully obtained an order adding it as a third
    party in the plaintiff’s pending personal injury action against the appellant.  Thereafter,
    the insurer settled all the plaintiff’s claims.  Although the insurer provided
    advance notice to the appellant of the intended settlement, the appellant
    neither consented to, signed, or otherwise authorized the settlement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    consent, a judgment in favour of the plaintiff was obtained against the insurer
    as part of the settlement.  However, no judgment was obtained against the
    appellant insured, the driver of the vehicle at the time of the accident
    in question. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge held that the insurer had an absolute liability to settle the
    plaintiff’s claims pursuant to s. 258(4) of the Act.  He also concluded that
    the insurer was entitled under s. 258(13) to be reimbursed by the appellant
    driver for the settlement amount, costs and interest.  In so holding, the
    motion judge stated: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I reject Mr. Quiroz’s argument that s. 258(1) refers
    to a requirement that CAA obtain <i>a judgment</i> in order to have the right
    to [recoup] monies paid to the Plaintiff Lockhard.  The section refers to
    a person having a claim, as does s. 258(4) [emphasis in original].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, we disagree.  Section 258(1) of the Act provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Any person who has a claim against an insured for
    which indemnity is provided by a contract evidenced by a motor vehicle liability
    policy, even if such person is not a party to the contract, may, <i>upon
    recovering a judgment therefor</i> in any province or territory of Canada <i>against
    the insured</i>, have the insurance money payable under the contract applied
    in or towards satisfaction <i>of the person’s judgment and of</i> <i>any
    other judgments or claims against the insured</i> covered by the contract
    and may, on the person’s own behalf and on behalf of all persons having such
    judgments or claims, maintain an action against the insurer to have the insurance
    money so applied [emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  The
    plain language of s. 258(1) provides for the application of insurance money
    in or towards satisfaction of a judgment recovered against the insured, in
    this case, the appellant.  Absent an agreement between the insurer and the
    insured to the contrary as, for example, concerning the application of insurance
    proceeds (see <i>Co-operative Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Ritchie</i>, [1983]
    2 S.C.R. 36), the recovery of such a judgment is a prerequisite to any entitlement
    under s.&nbsp;258(1) to access available insurance monies.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
    judgment was obtained against the appellant insured.  The  insurer argues
    that the authority provided to an insurer under O.A.P. No. 1, the standard
    motor vehicle policy then in use in Ontario, to settle a case without an
    insured’s consent, is tantamount to a contractual agreement by the insured
    to reimburse the insurer for any settlement monies paid.  We reject this
    contention.  Section 3.3.1 of O.A.P. No. 1 authorizes an insurer to settle
    directly a plaintiff’s claims against an insured with or without an insured’s
    consent.  What it does not do is permit an insurer to thereby bind the insured
    to a judgment against the insured <i>at the instance of the insurer itself</i> for
    the amount of the settlement paid.  Stated somewhat differently, nothing
    in O.A.P. No. 1 constitutes an agreement by an insured to the reasonableness
    of a settlement made under s. 3.3.1.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    cases relied upon by the insurer do not assist its position.  These cases
    were predicated on either a specific agreement between the insurer and the
    insured on the terms of settlement, or an actual or deemed judgment recovered
    against the insured: see <i>Co-operative Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Ritchie</i>,<i> supra,</i> and <i>Campanaro
    v. Kim</i> (1999), 41 O.R. (3d) 545 (C.A.).  That is not this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    does s. 254 of the Act assist the insurer on the facts here.  That section
    contemplates an express non-waiver or reimbursement agreement between an
    insurer and its insured concerning amounts paid by the insurer to a third
    party in respect of a claim or judgment against the insured.  But no such
    agreement was entered into in this case; nor, as we have indicated, do the
    terms of O.A.P. No. 1 constitute such an agreement concerning settlement
    monies paid by an insurer in relation to a personal injury claim against
    an insured.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the scheme envisaged by s. 258 of the Act, in combination with
    O.A.P. No. 1, contemplates the balancing of an insurer’s right to minimize
    its exposure to a tort claimant with an insured’s right, in the absence of
    an agreement between the insurer and the insured or a judgment against the
    insured, to be protected against unreasonable settlements by its insurer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the circumstances of this case, therefore, summary judgment against the appellant
    was not available.  The appeal is allowed.  The summary judgment below is
    set aside with costs to the appellant, on the partial indemnity scale, here
    and below, fixed in the total amount of $13,500, inclusive of disbursements
    and GST.</p>
