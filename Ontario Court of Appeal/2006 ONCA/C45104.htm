      of Justices Anne M. Molloy and George D. Lane and the Associate Chief Justice
      of the Superior Court of Justice, J. Douglas Cunningham (dissenting), sitting

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal relates to whether the applicant, Mr. Rolfe, a total stranger who
    believed that he witnessed a brutal act of police misconduct, can make a
    public complaint under s. 57(1) of the <i>Police Services Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. P-15.  The section allows a member of the public who is “directly
    affected” by the conduct that is the subject of the complaint to make a public
    complaint.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant witnessed an incident involving what he believed amounted to an
    unprovoked assault on an unknown woman by a Toronto Police Service Officer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Chief of Police and the Ontario Civilian Commission on Police Services held
    that the applicant was not “directly affected” and thus could not bring a
    complaint.  The majority of the Divisional Court allowed Mr. Rolfe’s application
    for judicial review, set aside the Commissioner’s decision and remitted the
    matter to the Chief of Police to be treated as a public complaint.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    the majority and dissenting judgment of the Divisional Court are well reasoned
    and persuasive.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    being said, it is not necessary to decide the difficult issue of the appropriate
    standard of review as, in our view, assuming that correctness is the appropriate
    standard of review as held by both the majority and dissent, the majority’s
    interpretation is wrong.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    stated by Associate Chief Justice Cunningham, in dissent, the word “directly” signifies
    an intention to narrow the scope of standing.  At paragraph 4 of his reasons,
    he pointed out:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It would be unreasonable to conclude that the Legislature
    intended each and every witness to alleged misconduct could interject themselves
    into the process of resolving public complaints, including becoming a party
    to any hearing and having rights of appeal from any decision taken.  Moreover,
    no useful purpose would be served by having this matter designated as a public
    complaint since the matter has been fully investigated and dealt with by
    the Chief of Police.  Treating this as a public complaint would allow Rolfe
    to obtain personal information concerning the alleged victim and to make
    decisions about the processing of the complaint.  Indeed, I see no utility
    in having Rolfe’s complaint designated as a public complaint.  In fact mischievous
    results could arise from doing so.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>And at paragraph 15:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There can be little doubt that Rolfe was “affected”
    by the impugned conduct.  However, that is not enough.  He has no personal
    interest in the matter.  If the Legislature intended to include anyone “affected” by
    police conduct, it would not have included the word “directly” in the legislation.  By
    including the word “directly”, the Legislature clearly sought to carefully
    circumscribe the right of complaint.  By including the word
    “directly” as an adverb, the Legislature must have intended there to be a
    degree of proximity before a person “affected” would be able to lodge a complaint.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    interpretation is well supported on the authorities referred to in his decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Directly
    affected” has been interpreted to mean a personal and individual interest
    as distinct from general interest which pertains to the whole community.   See <i>Canadian
    Union of Public Employees, Local 30 v. Alberta (Public Health and Advisory
    Board</i>), [1996] A.J. No. 48 (C.A.).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the conclusion of the Associate Chief Justice that Mr. Rolfe could
    not provide the necessary link that he was “directly affected.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We

    Justice.</p>
