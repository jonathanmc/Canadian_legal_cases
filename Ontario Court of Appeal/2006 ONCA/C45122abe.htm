style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is conceded that the conditional sentence of twelve months for the offence
    of possession of a restricted weapon that was fully loaded (a .45 calibre
    handgun) was an illegal sentence. Under s. 95(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    that offence is punishable by a minimum sentence of imprisonment for one
    year when the Crown proceeds by way of indictment, as was the case here.
    We note that in addition to pleading guilty to the s.&nbsp;&nbsp;95(1) offence
    (possession of a restricted weapon with readily accessible ammunition), the
    respondent also pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm knowing that the
    serial number had been removed and also, the offence of carrying a concealed
    weapon.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent was 19 years old at the time of the offence. He had a prior youth
    record for assault causing bodily harm for which he had been sentenced to
    probation for two years. The offences for which he pleaded guilty occurred
    in the early morning hours on a public street. When the police apprehended
    the respondent, he fled and a brief struggle ensued before the police were
    able to contain him. In the course of the arrest, the police found the .45
    calibre handgun concealed in the waistband of the respondent’s pants. Fortunately,
    for all concerned, the arrest did not result in serious, if not fatal consequences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the circumstances, we are of the view that a sentence of two years less one
    day, which Crown counsel at trial was seeking, would have been appropriate.
    In so concluding, we have considered the youth of the respondent, his potential
    for rehabilitation and the strong family support that is available to him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    question, at this point, is what sentence should now be imposed. In particular,
    should we accede to the Crown’s request that the respondent be incarcerated
    for a period of five months less one day.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, having regard to all of the circumstances, we are not persuaded
    that the interests of justice warrant re-incarceration. The respondent had
    served six months in pre-trial custody, for which it is agreed he should
    be credited on a 2 for 1 basis. He has successfully completed seven months
    of his conditional sentence and while on bail pending trial, he complied
    fully with the terms of a restrictive bail order for a period of ten months.
    Taking those factors into account, we are satisfied that the respondent has
    effectively served a sentence of  two years less a day. Accordingly, we would
    grant leave to appeal sentence and at this point, substitute a sentence of
    time served to be followed by two years probation on the terms and conditions
    imposed by the trial judge. The weapons prohibition under s. 109 of the <i>Code</i> and
    the s. 491 forfeiture order shall remain in place.</p>
