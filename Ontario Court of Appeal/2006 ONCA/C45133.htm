  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the sentence
      of twenty-one months concurrent for two counts of breach of recognizance
      imposed on February 3, 2006 by Justice Judith C. Beaman of the Ontario
      Court of Justice.</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BY THE COURT:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The appellant
    applies for leave to appeal and if leave is granted, appeals from concurrent
    sentences of twenty-one months imposed by Justice J. C. Beaman of the Ontario
    Court of Justice on two counts of breach of recognizance contrary to s. 811(a)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. The appellant was sentenced at the same time
    to three months consecutive on a charge of assaulting a peace officer in
    the execution of her duty. He takes no issue with that sentence; nor does
    he challenge the three-year period of probation following the completion
    of his custodial sentences. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      For reasons that
    follow, we would reduce the sentences for the two counts of breach of recognizance
    to twelve months each concurrent. In doing so, we note that the trial judge
    initially imposed sentences of eighteen months concurrent on those counts.
    In the end, however, at the request of the appellant, she added on another
    three months so that he could serve his sentence in the penitentiary. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The appellant
    is a thirty-three year-old career criminal. He has been committing crimes
    on a regular and persistent basis since age fifteen. His criminal record
    is appalling. It contains numerous convictions for crimes of violence, dishonesty
    and offences against the administration of justice. Of particular note, the
    appellant has been sentenced to the penitentiary on three separate occasions
    for serious crimes of violence and he has six prior convictions for breaches
    of court orders.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      On November 18,
    2005, upon his release from federal custody, the appellant entered into a
    recognizance under s. 810.2 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. He was required
    to do so because the authorities had reasonable grounds to fear that once
    in the community, he would commit a
    “serious personal injury offence”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Under the terms
    of his recognizance, among other things, the appellant was required to keep
    the peace and be of good behaviour and carry his recognizance with him at
    all times and produce it to a police officer upon request. On June 13, 2006,
    he breached both of those conditions by failing to carry a copy of his recognizance
    and then spitting into the face of the policewoman who arrested him. Charges
    were laid and the appellant eventually pleaded guilty to two counts of breach
    of recognizance and one count of assaulting a police officer in the execution
    of her duty. The Crown proceeded by way of indictment on all counts. Accordingly,
    on the breach of recognizance counts, the appellant faced a maximum penalty
    under s. 811(a) of the <i>Code </i>of two years imprisonment on each.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The trial judge
    provided detailed and comprehensive reasons for sentence. In determining
    that concurrent sentences of eighteen months (later altered to twenty-one
    months at the request of the appellant) were required on the breach of recognizance
    counts, she quite properly recognized that general and specific deterrence
    and the need to protect the public from high-risk offenders such as the appellant
    were paramount. She also recognized that proportionality was important and
    that the sentences imposed should reflect the gravity and seriousness of
    the crimes. Lastly, she noted that “the more serious the reasons for the
    Recognizance, the more serious the breach should be considered”.  By that,
    we take her to mean that in assessing the seriousness of the breach, the
    criminal history of the offender must be taken into account. (See <i>R. v.
    Jacobson</i> [2006] O.J. No.&nbsp;1558 Ont. C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      We take no issue
    with those principles. In our view, they reflect the proper principles of
    sentencing in this case. In particular, we agree that general and specific
    deterrence and the need to protect the public were paramount here. The breach
    of recognizance offences were serious. One involved elements of violence
    and both involved disdain for authority, characteristics that featured prominently
    in the appellant’s criminal record. For that reason alone, they called for
    stiff penalties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      That said, we
    have concerns that in arriving at the length of sentence for these two counts,
    the trial judge applied an incorrect principle. The principle in question
    is identified and ultimately adopted by the trial judge at pp. 49 and 50
    of her reasons as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The Crown has
    argued that Mr. Labbe is someone who has already been found to be at risk
    of committing a serious, violent offence and personal injury to the community.
    Simply by virtue of the fact that he is this person and one who has been
    placed on a section 810.2, this is, by itself, a statement as to where this
    offender falls on the spectrum of least to worst offender. <i>He has argued
    that just by virtue of this fact, it places him much closer to the end of
    the worst offender</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>I accept
      Mr. Drummond’s [Crown counsel] characterization of Mr. Labbe as being on
      the worst end of the continuum</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, we do not agree that persons who have been required to enter into
    a recognizance under s. 810.2 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> should automatically
    be treated as “the worst offenders” for sentencing purposes. On that approach,
    regardless of the gravity of the breach or the rehabilitative steps taken
    by the offender, s. 810.2 offenders would inevitably receive sentences at
    or near the two-year maximum limit. That approach cannot be right. It effectively
    emasculates the principles of proportionality and rehabilitation that trial
    judges must take into account in arriving at a fit and just sentence. (In
    this case, we recognize that the principle of rehabilitation plays no meaningful
    role.)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the present case, we believe that the trial judge applied the impugned principle
    in arriving at the eighteen-month concurrent sentence for the breach of recognizance
    counts (later raised to twenty-one months at the request of the appellant).
    That amounts to an error in principle and entitles us to review those sentences
    and impose sentences that we deem to be fit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    all the circumstances, without minimizing the seriousness of the breach offences,
    we think they should have attracted sentences of twelve months concurrent.
    Accordingly, we would grant leave to appeal and vary the sentences on those
    counts. In all other respects, we would not interfere with the sentence imposed
    by the trial judge. For greater certainty, the total custodial sentence will
    now be fifteen months (twelve months concurrent for the breach of recognizance
    counts and three months consecutive for the assault police count).</p>
