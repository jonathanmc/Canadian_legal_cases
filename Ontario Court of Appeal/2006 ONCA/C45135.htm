    November 2003, a 10&#8209;year marriage between a highly successful businessman
    and a woman who stayed at home to raise two children ended in divorce.  In
    proceedings in the family division of the Superior Court of Justice, Kruzick&nbsp;J.
    dealt with a large number of issues, including custody, access, equalization,
    and spousal and child support.</p>

    order, including the substantial amounts ordered for spousal and child support
    and for costs.  However, he does appeal two aspects relating to the enforcement
    of the financial components of the order.  First, the appellant contends
    that the trial judge improperly pierced the veil of the appellant’s companies
    and imposed liability on them for the amounts owing pursuant to the court
    order.  Second, the appellant challenges the trial judge’s order making costs
    and pre&#8209;judgment interest “payable and enforceable as spousal support”.</p>

      trial judge fixed the appellant’s income at $700,000.  He ordered the appellant
      to pay spousal support of $16,072 per month, child support of $7,481 per
      month, and 72&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of special and extraordinary expenses
      under s.&nbsp;7 of the </span><i><span lang=EN-US>Child Support Guidelines</span></i><span lang=EN-US>.  The
      trial judge ordered that spousal and child support be paid from November&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2003;
      accordingly, he fixed the arrears for these payments at $450,016 and $73,743
      respectively, after taking account of some child support payments during
      the relevant period.  The trial judge also ordered that the appellant post
      security for future support in the amount of $350,000 and maintain a $1,000,000
      term policy of life insurance with the respondent designated as the irrevocable
      beneficiary.</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
      the trial judge ordered that all amounts owed by the appellant be secured
      and enforceable against not only the appellant personally, but also against
      the various enterprises through which he operated his construction and
      landscaping business.  The appellant contends that this component of the
      order constitutes an improper piercing of the corporate veil.</span></p>

  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>(1)       Did the trial judge err by piercing the veil of the appellant’s
      companies and imposing a charge against them for the various amounts owed
      by the appellant to the respondent and their children?</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>(2)       Did the trial judge err by making the costs and prejudgment

lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Before
      turning to the two issues raised on this appeal, I make a preliminary observation.  This
      is a highly unusual appeal.  The effect of the trial judge’s final order
      is that the appellant owes the respondent and his children more than $800,000
      for spousal support, child support, equalization, costs and interest.  The
      appellant challenges not one penny of this amount.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Instead,

      trial judge.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      my view, the picture presented by this unusual dichotomy is an obvious,
      and troubling, one.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><u><span lang=EN-US>The

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge ordered the appellant to pay large sums of money to the respondent
      and his children.  He sought to enforce his order by ordering that the
      appellant not deplete or dissipate “any property under his control” (paragraph&nbsp;17).  In
      addition, the trial judge ordered that “all amounts owing” by the appellant
      were to be secured by way of charge against the appellant personally and
      his companies, including “Precision Landscape Construction Ltd, Precision
      Paving and Landscape Construction or Landscape by Precision”
    (paragraph&nbsp;18).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Mrs. Wildman seeks an order for
      security and preservation of a number of assets owned by Mr.&nbsp;Wildman,
      be these assets in his name or in the name of the
    “Precision” corporate entities.  The pleadings of Mrs. Wildman implicate
    the corporate assets under the unjust enrichment and constructive trust portion
    of the claim.  I had difficulty with this portion of the relief sought where
    the corporate entity is not a party.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Counsel for Mrs.&nbsp;Wildman
      has directed me to a decision of this court, specifically <i>Arsenault
      v. Arsenault </i>[1998] O.J. No.&nbsp;1423 where Wood&nbsp;J. deals with
      the issue of lifting the corporate veil in dealing with enforcement that
      arises from a support obligation.  Accordingly, and following that decision
      I am prepared to and make the order as sought.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      appellant submits that the trial judge’s reasons and order are based on
      a violation of a fundamental and well&#8209;known legal principle – a corporation
      has a separate legal personality that must be respected.  Accordingly,
      a court should not ‘pierce the corporate veil’ and attach liability to
      persons associated with a corporate entity.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      principle of the separate legal personality of a corporation is an important
      one.  However, it is not an absolute principle.  In my view, a particularly
      clear, concise and useful description of the principle and its limits was
      articulated by Laskin&nbsp;J.A. in </span><i><span
lang=EN-US>642947 Ontario Ltd. v. Fleischer</span></i><span
lang=EN-US> (2001), 56 O.R. (3d) 417 at paras.&nbsp;67&#8209;68 (“</span><i><span
lang=EN-US>Fleischer</span></i><span
lang=EN-US>”):</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
      pierce the corporate veil is to disregard the separate legal personality
      of a corporation, a fundamental principle of corporate law recognized in <i>Salomon
      v. Salomon &amp; Co.</i>, [1897] A.C. 22.  Only exceptional cases – cases
      where applying the <i>Salomon</i> principle would be “flagrantly” unjust – warrant
      going behind the company and imposing personal liability.  Thus, in <i>Clarkson
      Co. Ltd. v. Zhelka et al</i>., [1967] 2 O.R. 565 at 578 (H.C.J.), Thompson
      J. held that instances in which the corporate veil has been pierced “represent
      refusals to apply the logic of the <i>Salomon</i> case where it would be
      flagrantly opposed to justice.”  Similarly, Wilson J. observed in <i>Kosmopoulos
      v. Constitution Insurance Co.</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 2 at 10, that the law
      on when the corporate veil can be pierced “follows no consistent principle.  The
      best that can be said is that the
    ‘separate entities’ principle is not enforced when it would yield a result ‘too
    flagrantly opposed to justice, convenience or the interests of the Revenue’:
    L.C.B. Gower, <i>Modern Company Law</i> (4th ed. 1979) at p. 112.”</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Typically,
      the corporate veil is pierced when the company is incorporated for an illegal,
      fraudulent or improper purpose.  But it can also be pierced if when incorporated “those
      in control expressly direct a wrongful thing to be done”.  <i>Clarkson
      v. Zhelka</i> at 578.  Sharpe J. set out a useful statement of the guiding
      principle in <i>Transamerica Life Insurance Co. of Canada v. Canada Life
      Assurance Co.</i> (1986), 28 O.R. (3d) 423 at 433-34 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)),
      aff’d [1997] O.J. No. 3754 (C.A.): “the courts will disregard the separate
      legal personality of a corporate entity where it is completely dominated
      and controlled and being used as a shield for fraudulent or improper conduct.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    note, at the outset, that what the trial judge did in this case was not a
    typical piercing of the corporate veil.  Most corporate veil cases involve
    an attempt by a claimant <i>to look through</i> a corporation to make the
    principal(s) liable for the obligations of the corporation.  In this instance,
    however, the trial judge allowed the respondent wife <i>to look to</i> the
    corporation to satisfy the obligations of its principal and sole shareholder,
    the appellant husband.  As a result, the usual concern regarding piercing
    the corporate veil –
    unanticipated personal liability – is not present.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    crucial question in this appeal is whether the exception to the principle
    of separate legal personality for corporations set out in <i>Fleischer</i> and <i>Transamerica
    Life Insurance</i> should be injected into family law.  Should the courts
    in appropriate family law cases disregard the separate legal personality
    of a corporate entity where, in the words of Sharpe&nbsp;J. in the latter
    case, “it is completely dominated and controlled and being used as a shield
    for fraudulent or improper conduct”?  In my view, the answer to this question
    is a resounding ‘Yes’.  I say this for two reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    s.&nbsp;18 of both the federal and provincial <i>Child Support Guidelines</i> contemplates
    piercing the corporate veil in appropriate cases:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>18.(1) Shareholder, director or officer –</b> Where
    a spouse is a shareholder, director or officer of a corporation and the court
    is of the opinion that the amount of the spouse’s annual income as determined
    under section&nbsp;16 does not fairly reflect all the money available to
    the spouse for the payment of child support, the court may consider the situations

    purpose of s.&nbsp;18 is to enable the courts to conduct a fair accounting
    of the money available for the payment of child support.  Justice Martinson
    commented in <i>Baum v. Baum</i> (1999), 182 D.L.R. (4th) 715 at para.&nbsp;128
    (B.C.S.C.):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Valid corporate objectives may differ from valid
    child support objectives.  The purpose of s.&nbsp;18 is to allow the court
    to “lift the corporate veil” to ensure that the money received as income
    by the paying parent fairly reflects all of the money available for the payment
    of child support.  This is particularly important in the case of a sole shareholder
    as that shareholder has the ability to control the income of the corporation.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>I agree with these observations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    in his reasons the trial judge explicitly referred to and adopted the analysis
    and conclusion of Wood&nbsp;J. in <i>Arsenault</i>, <i>supra</i>.  In my
    view, he was right to do so.  <i>Arsenault</i> is a particularly well&#8209;reasoned
    and useful decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Arsenault</i>,
    the parties had a traditional marriage in which the husband provided all
    the income while the wife was the primary caregiver for their four children.  Pursuant
    to a settlement agreement, the husband was to pay $1800 per month in support.  The
    husband was a software consultant who worked for a single employer, Soldier’s
    Memorial Hospital in Orillia.  However, his income was paid to a numbered
    company of which he was the sole shareholder.  As a result of this arrangement,
    child and spousal support payments were made in an inconsistent manner, causing
    frustration and financial difficulties for the wife, as well as the accrual
    of arrears.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice
    Wood described Mr.&nbsp;Arsenault and his corporation in this fashion, at
    paras.&nbsp;10&#8209;12:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The respondent is a talented software consultant.  Although
    he does work for more than one person or organization, his primary source
    of revenue is a permanent contract with the Soldier’s Memorial Hospital in
    Orillia.  The funds which flow to him from this contract are more than sufficient
    to satisfy the support requirements of the separation agreement and are received
    at regular intervals.  However, the contract with Soldier’s Memorial Hospital
    is not between that institution and the respondent.  Rather it is with 1112705
    Ontario Limited.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This is a corporation of which the respondent is
    the sole shareholder, director, officer and employee.  Since the respondent
    offers no evidence, the reason for the corporation’s existence is unknown.  However,
    it would not be unreasonable to assume that it was incorporated for the tax
    flexibility and limited liability protection it might offer to what is in
    reality a sole proprietorship.  The corporation carries on no activity outside
    personal ones of the respondent.  It exists solely as a vehicle through which
    funds flow to him.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is this arrangement which frustrates the regular
    flow of support to the applicant and the children and prevents the Family
    Responsibility Office from being able to effectively enforce the terms of
    the agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Against
    this backdrop, Wood&nbsp;J. shifted to his legal analysis.  Because his analysis
    is especially clear and, in my view compelling, I set out in full paras.&nbsp;24&#8209;30
    of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a name="OLE_LINK1"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
        the area of corporate and commercial law, the Courts are generally reluctant
        to look behind the corporate veil unless there are circumstances in which
        it is appropriate that this be done.&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, the following
        circumstances must be present:</span></a></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
      individual exercises complete control of finances, policy, and business
      practices of the company.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
      control must have been used by the individual to commit a fraud or wrong
      that would unjustly deprive a claimant of his or her rights.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
      misconduct must be the reason for the third party's injury or loss.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
      of those criteria apply in this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;The respondent has absolute
      control of the company, as he is the sole shareholder, director and officer.&nbsp;&nbsp;His
      actions in determining when and how monies are to be paid by the corporation
      to him have resulted in the frustration of the operation of the <i>Family
      Responsibility and Support Arrears Enforcement Act</i>. The frustration
      of the operation of that Act has prevented support flowing in a regular
      and orderly fashion to the applicant and the children.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>While
      I am satisfied that the situation in this case meets even the most rigorous
      standards applied in corporate law to the lifting of the veil; I take some
      comfort in the fact that in the area of family law a somewhat more relaxed
      approach has been taken by the Courts.&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>M.(B.B.) v. M.(W.W.)</i> (1994),
      7 R.F.L. (4th) 255 (Alta. Q.B.), a general contractor was ordered to pay
      a portion of the monies owing to a solely held corporation operated by
      the respondent (payor) to satisfy arrears of support.&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar
      approach to closely held corporations' assets has been taken by Courts
      in Ontario in <i>Bregman v. Bregman</i> (1978), 21 O.R. (2d) 722 (H.C.J.),
      affirmed by the Court of Appeal at (1979), 25 O.R. (2d) 254 (C.A.) and <i>Crowe
      v. Crowe</i>, [1985] O.C.P. 110 (H.C.J.). [Footnote omitted.]</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
      should also be noted that a piercing of the corporate veil for the purpose
      of imputing income is not only mandated, but set out in detail in section
      18 of both the Federal and Provincial <i>Child Support Guidelines</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;It
      could be argued that section 18 of the Guidelines [is] a codification of
      a common practice in the Courts across Canada when imputing income for
      the purpose of setting the appropriate level of child or spousal support. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
      is also a strong public policy argument to be made for a review of closely
      held corporations in the context of support.&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite improvements
      in the rate of collection, an enormous number of support orders are in
      arrears.&nbsp;&nbsp;Non payment of support often results in support recipients
      and their families having to rely on public funds. The connection between
      non payment of support and the present levels of child poverty in Canada
      hardly needs to be underlined.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
      title of the <i>Family Responsibility and Support       Arrears Enforcement
      Act</i> announces its intended purpose unequivocally.  It is legislation
      designed specifically to improve the dismal support payment statistics
      in the Province of Ontario.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in situations such as the
      one before the Court, the Act is frustrated in its purpose.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
      will be many situations in which funds flow through many hands from their
      ultimate source to a payor. Where this is so, for appropriate reasons the
      Director must look to the immediate source of funds as the income source.
      Where, however, the income source as defined in the Act is no more than
      the alter ego of the payor and has no function other than as a vehicle
      through which funds owing to the payor are channelled, it is appropriate
      to look through that entity to determine the relationship between the real
      income source and the payor.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
      this case, the real income source (the Soldier's Memorial Hospital) has
      a relationship with the respondent, Gary Arsenault.&nbsp;&nbsp;He is their
      computer programmer. He is on the premises each day and is responsible
      for ensuring the proper operation of their software systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;If
      something goes wrong, they call Gary Arsenault, not 1112705 Ontario Limited.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      expertise upon which they depend, and for which they pay, is the respondent's
      and the respondent's alone. 1112705 Ontario Limited has no employees other
      than the respondent.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has no owners, officers, or directors
      other than the respondent.&nbsp;&nbsp;It carries on no business other than
      that carried on by the respondent.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, in short, irrelevant
      to the relationship between the Hospital and the respondent and should
      be so for the purposes of attaching funds paid to the respondent for support
      purposes.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant sets against <i>Arsenault</i> the decision of the British Columbia
    Court of Appeal in <i>Rohani v. Rohani</i> (2004), 34 B.C.L.R. (4th) 62.  In <i>Rohani</i>,
    the court did not pierce the corporate veil of a company in a matrimonial
    case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Rohani</i> is
    distinguishable on the facts from this appeal.  In <i>Rohani</i>, the husband
    was not the sole shareholder or director of the company in issue, though
    he did make almost all of the business decisions relating to it.  Moreover,
    the company in question was merely the husband’s vehicle for participating
    in a much larger business enterprise that involved other owners.  In this
    case, the appellant is the sole shareholder and director of Precision Landscape
    Construction Ltd. and the only person involved in his other business entities.  Accordingly,
    there is no concern here that an order attaching to the appellant’s various
    business entitites might have the effect of expropriating the assets of innocent
    third parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    putting aside the factual difference between the two cases, the appellant
    relies on some of the reasoning in <i>Rohani</i> to support his position.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the appellant relies on <i>Rohani</i> to argue that if the existence of the
    company in issue pre&#8209;dates the separation of the parties and it was
    created for legitimate business, succession and tax planning objectives – in
    short, if there has been a genuine incorporation – then the corporate veil
    should not be pierced.  The appellant submits that Precision Landscape Construction
    Ltd. comes within this description; it was incorporated long before the parties
    separated and for legitimate business and tax reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this point, I do not read <i>Rohani</i> in the absolute fashion contended
    for by the appellant.  On the contrary, I read <i>Rohani</i> as standing
    for the proposition that the history relating to how a spouse sets up his
    business affairs is a relevant factor in resolving the financial issues in
    a matrimonial case.  It is not, however, the controlling factor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    set out again what Laskin&nbsp;J.A. said in <i>Fleischer</i>, at para.&nbsp;68:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Typically,
      the corporate veil is pierced when the company is incorporated for an illegal,
      fraudulent or improper purpose.  <i>But it can also be pierced if when
      incorporated “those in control expressly direct a wrongful thing to be
      done”</i>.  <i>Clarkson v. Zhelka</i> at 578.  Sharpe J. set out a useful
      statement of the guiding principle in <i>Transamerica Life Insurance Co.
      of Canada v. Canada Life Assurance Co.</i> (1986), 28 O.R. (3d) 423 at
      433-34 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)), aff’d [1997] O.J. No. 3754 (C.A.): <i>“the
      courts will disregard the separate legal personality of a corporate entity
      where it is completely dominated and controlled and being used as a shield
      for fraudulent or improper conduct.”</i>  [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is clear from this passage that a company need not have been <i>created</i> with
    an improper purpose in mind to justify piercing the corporate veil; it is
    sufficient that the corporation is <i>used</i> for an improper purpose.  In
    a matrimonial context, what this must mean is that the snapshot of the company
    at the time of incorporation is probably nothing more than a starting point.  The
    real focus must be on the relationship between the company and the controlling
    spouse and how the spouse is using the corporation after the parties have
    separated and before the financial issues are resolved.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellant relies on <i>Rohani</i> to support his argument that since
    the respondent benefited from the use of the corporate vehicle during the
    marriage, she cannot resile now and try to convert corporate assets into
    personal assets of her husband.  The appellant especially relies on <i>Rohani</i>,
    at para.&nbsp;20:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>While
      the wife had no direct interest in Myfam she benefited from its existence
      during the marriage to the extent that it presumably provided a tax shelter
      for assets and income and was used by the husband to fund family living
      expenses and gifts to the wife.&nbsp; The use for family purposes was central
      to the conclusion that the Class A shares were family assets.&nbsp; While
      the husband's use of company funds may have been questionable by others,
      the wife was not defrauded or prejudiced on that account.&nbsp; To paraphrase
      Wilson J., the wife, having received the benefits of incorporation, should
      not be allowed to escape the burden of its existence by looking directly
      to its assets as if they were personal assets of the husband.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, I do not agree with this reasoning.  It was the appellant who chose
    to incorporate.  He was the director and sole shareholder and he made all
    the business decisions.  The appellant alone chose the benefits and burdens
    of the decision to incorporate.  It may well be that the respondent and the
    children benefited from these decisions during the marriage.  However, so
    did the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
    fundamentally, the emphasis on how assets were accumulated and used during
    the marriage, in my view, is misplaced.  Once a marriage collapses, the focus
    must shift to the parties’ <i>real</i> assets post&#8209;separation and a
    fair distribution of those assets between the parties and, importantly, with
    an eye firmly fixed on the future needs of the children.  In this context,
    piercing the veil of a company owned and controlled by one party may, in
    some circumstances, be entirely appropriate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    return to <i>Arsenault</i>.  After reviewing the case law, Wood&nbsp;J. summarized
    it in this fashion, at para.&nbsp;24, as I have previously set out:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
      the area of corporate and commercial law, the Courts are generally reluctant
      to look behind the corporate veil unless there are circumstances in which
      it is appropriate that this be done.&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, the following
      circumstances must be present:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The individual exercises complete control
      of finances, policy, and business practices of the company.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That control must have been used by the
      individual to commit a fraud or wrong that would unjustly deprive a claimant
      of his or her rights.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The misconduct must be the reason for the
      third party's injury or loss.</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>Justice&nbsp;Wood decided that it
    was appropriate to apply these three factors in the matrimonial context.  In
    my view, he was right to do so.  Accordingly, I will conduct the same analysis
    in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the appellant is the sole owner of, and exercises complete control over,
    his various business enterprises.  With respect to Precision Landscape Construction
    Ltd., the appellant is the sole shareholder and director.  In the transcript
    of a motion before Clarke&nbsp;J. on May&nbsp;10,&nbsp;2005, the appellant
    called himself a “sole proprietor”.  Furthermore, the appellant appears to
    make no distinction between his personal and business assets.  For example,
    in the cash logs prepared by the appellant (and produced at trial by the
    respondent) the appellant did not differentiate between personal and business
    assets.  In short, the appellant’s business enterprises are his <i>alter
    ego</i>; they are not distinct from him and have no connection to any third
    party.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    there is no question that the appellant has controlled his business enterprises
    and structured his corporate assets in a way that diverts money from them
    to his own personal use. The most compelling evidence on this issue is probably
    the evidence gathered by the private investigator engaged by the respondent
    concerning the appellant&rsquo;s business relationship with a client, M.
    Z. It is clear from this evidence that the appellant negotiated payment options
    with Mr. Z. in a manner designed to maximize the appellant&rsquo;s personal
    cash intake and minimize the amount of money flowing to the company.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the losers in all of this have been the respondent and the children.  They
    have not received, and continue to not receive, the money that various courts
    have found they should receive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary, on the facts of this case it would be flagrantly opposed to justice
    to allow the appellant to hide behind a corporate veil that he does not himself
    respect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant makes one other argument on the corporate veil issue.  He contends
    that the trial judge erred by making orders against the appellant’s companies
    because the companies were not named as parties and, therefore, had no notice
    of the matrimonial litigation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree.  This is matrimonial litigation, not commercial litigation.  Importantly,
    the record establishes that the appellant and his companies are one and the
    same.  No third party has any interest in any of the companies.  The appellant
    was given notice of the proceedings and thus, the companies, his alter ego,
    were also given notice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the end, although a business person is entitled to create corporate structures
    and relationships for valid business, tax and other reasons, the law must
    be vigilant to ensure that permissible corporate arrangements do not work
    an injustice in the realm of family law.  In appropriate cases, piercing
    the corporate veil of one spouse’s business enterprises may be an essential
    mechanism for ensuring that the other spouse and children of the marriage
    receive the financial support to which, by law, they are entitled.  The trial
    judge was correct to recognize that this was such a case.</p>

      provides:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>1(1) In this Act, “support order” means a provision in an order made

      advantages of an order under this provision are that the costs award is
      enforceable by the Family Responsibility Office and the order is not discharged

      validity of an order making a costs award at trial enforceable by the Family

      in that case the court went even further and ordered, at para.&nbsp;17,
      that costs of the appeal also constitute a support order and
    “are fully enforceable by the Family Responsibility Office.”</span></p>

      note that both s. 1(1)(g) of the </span><i><span
lang=EN-US>FRSEA</span></i><span lang=EN-US> and the wording of the court’s endorsement
      in </span><i><span lang=EN-US>A.M.D. v. A.J.P.</span></i><span lang=EN-US> use
      the terminology of “enforceable”, not “payable and enforceable” as in the
      order in this case.  The respondent concedes that nothing is added by the
      words “payable and”.  For the sake of accuracy, they should be deleted
      from paragraph&nbsp;14 of the order.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      appellant makes a second argument on this issue.  He contends that the
      trial and the final order dealt with several issues other than support,
      including custody, access, property, debts, and preservation, freezing
      and charging orders.  The appellant submits that only those costs relating
      to support should be enforceable pursuant to s.&nbsp;1(1)(g) of the </span><i><span lang=EN-US>FRSEA</span></i><span
lang=EN-US>.</span></p>

      disagree.  The principal issue at trial was spousal and child support.  In
      any event, I agree with Thomson&nbsp;J.’s observation in </span><i><span lang=EN-US>Re
      Stancati v. Stancati</span></i><span lang=EN-US> (1984), 49 O.R. (2d) 284
      at 287 (Prov. Ct.): “It seems to me to be both impractical and inappropriate
      to suggest that this court should attempt to dissect cost awards in order
      to determine which part of the award relates to the support aspect of the
      proceedings.”  I also note that </span><i><span
lang=EN-US>A.M.D. v. A.J.P.</span></i><span
lang=EN-US> was a multi&#8209;issue matrimonial case in which this court upheld
      the trial judge’s order that all costs be enforceable by the Family Responsibility
      Office.</span></p>

      appellant submits that prejudgment interest was not awarded by the trial
      judge on the support order or arrears, but only with respect to the calculation
      of the equalization payment.  Accordingly, even if s.&nbsp;1(1)(g) of the </span><i><span
lang=EN-US>FRSEA </span></i>permits “interest”
    to be enforced as support, the requisite link between the interest and a
    support order is missing in this case.</p>

lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    agree.  Both paragraph&nbsp;15 of the final order and the trial judge’s reasons
    link prejudgment interest to equalization, and only to equalization.  Accordingly,
    there is no foundation within the wording of s.&nbsp;1(1)(g) of the <i>FRSEA</i> for
    an order making the awards of prejudgment interest enforceable as spousal
    support.</p>

    result is that the trial judge’s awards of prejudgment interest in the amounts

    that the trial judge’s order applies to three businesses, only one of which,
    Precision Landscape Construction Ltd., is a registered company.  However,
    in the circumstances of this case, it is fair to treat all three of the appellant’s
    business entities in a similar fashion.  Accordingly, if the trial judge’s
    order cannot stand against Precision Landscape Construction Ltd., it should
    not bind the other two business entities either.</p>
