  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    July 11, 2003, Jennifer Currie was injured in a motor vehicle accident in
    the state of Michigan, U.S.A. and, as a result, she required emergency medical
    services there.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time of the accident, Ms. Currie was insured under two policies: first,
    a standard Ontario automobile policy issued by Aviva Canada Ltd. (“Aviva”)
    and second, a travel insurance policy issued by RBC Travel Insurance Company
    (“RBC”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Currie contacted RBC and made an emergency claim for medical expenses. RBC
    paid the total claim in the sum of $23,960.82 (Cdn) on behalf of Ms. Currie
    on October 2, 2003.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>RBC
    then brought the within proceeding for reimbursement by Aviva of the amount
    it paid on behalf of Ms. Currie.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    March 3, 2006, RBC brought a motion under Rules 20 and 21 for judgment compelling
    Aviva to reimburse RBC in full for the amounts paid on behalf of Ms. Currie,
    and for a determination of a question of law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion proceeded before Moore J. who found that both the RBC policy and the
    Aviva policy provided primary coverage. That being so, in his view s. 268(6)
    of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I. 8 applied. That section provides
    that an automobile policy is excess “to any other insurance not being automobile
    insurance of the same type.” He concluded that RBC was solely responsible
    to pay Ms. Currie’s medical expenses.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>RBC
    appeals that decision, taking the position that its policy is excess and
    the Aviva policy is primary and that therefore Aviva is responsible to reimburse
    RBC for the amounts it paid on behalf of Ms. Currie together with interest
    and costs. I agree and, in the circumstances conclude that s. 268(6) of the <i>Insurance
    Act</i>, does not apply.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'><u>GENERAL PRINCIPLES</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    begin with the observation, that in the usual case, the interpretation of
    a policy of insurance raises a question of law where the standard of review
    is correctness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Insurance
    policies, like other contracts, are to be interpreted based on the plain
    and ordinary meaning of the language used therein (absent, of course, any
    special or defined meanings set out in the contract). As this court said
    in <i>Trafalgar Insurance Company of Canada v. Imperial Oil Limited</i> (2001),
    57 O.R. (3d) 425 at para. 23, “the plain meaning of the policy language should
    be respected. Ambiguities should not be judge-made; they should be apparent
    from a reasonable reading of the policy.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    law presumes that the words used in a policy of insurance have meaning; if
    the meaning of the words is clear, it should be given effect. In <i>Neill
    and Gunter Inc. v. Simcoe &amp; Erie General Insurance Co.</i> (1985), 60
    N.B.R  (2d) 351 at para. 14 (Q.B. (T.D.)), aff’d [1986] N.B.J. No. 17 (C.A.)
    it was stated:  “The court will if possible give effect to all parts of an
    instrument and an interpretation which gives a reasonable meaning to all
    its provisions is preferred to one which leaves a portion of the writing
    useless or inexplicable.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is of interest to note that before the motions judge Aviva took the following
    position:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[T]he RBC policy
    is not an excess but rather a primary policy and, as such, there is sufficient
    overlap between the coverages provided by the two policies that the two insurers
    need jointly share the claim. Furthermore it was agreed between the parties
    that if it were determined that both policies provided primary coverage,
    the Currie claim should be split equally between the two insurers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this court, Aviva seeks to uphold the motion judge’s finding that, although
    its policy provides primary coverage as did the RBC policy, contribution
    is governed by s. 268(6) of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, and accordingly the
    RBC policy is primary and the Aviva policy excess.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue between the parties turns on the wording of their respective policies.
    As this court noted in <i>Trenton Cold Storage Ltd. v. St. Paul Fire and
    Marine Insurance Co.</i> (2001), 199 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 654 at para.
    9,  “[i]n order to determine the nature and extent of the coverage, it is
    necessary to look at the obligation to pay under each policy and to consider
    any other applicable provisions in the context of each insurance agreement
    as a whole.” </p>

    406 (Sup. Ct.), aff’d [2002] O.J. No. 3566 (C.A.) Lane J. considered whether
    a policy of travel insurance providing coverage for medical benefits or the

    was to consider s. 268(6) of the <i>Insurance Act</i> as the governing enactment
    and that, no matter the language of the travel policy, this provision made
    the travel insurance primary cover and the SAB excess. In rejecting that
    submission Lane J. stated at para. 10:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I cannot read
    that subsection so widely. If it intended to override the terms of policies
    of insurance, the legislature would surely have done so explicitly. The subsection
    must, in my opinion, be read as making the SAB excess to any other insurance
    which is, by its own terms, bound to provide ‘first dollar coverage’.  Since
    the applicant’s policy is, by its own terms, a second payor, s. 268(6) has

    9 of the travel policy at issue in the <i>Travel Insurance</i> case, <i>supra </i>at
    para. 5, explicitly stated that it provided second payor coverage:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The coverages
    outlined in this insurance are second payor plans. If there are other third
    party liability, group or individual basic or extended health insurance plans

    liability insurance in force concurrently herewith, amounts payable hereunder

    of residence that are in excess of the amounts for which an Insured person
    is insured under such other coverage.</p>

    my view, the language in the travel policy at issue in that case admitted
    of no other meaning. It specifically stated a) that it was second payor insurance
    and b) that where there were provincial or territorial auto insurance plans
    that provided hospital, medical or therapeutic coverage, amounts payable
    under the travel policy were limited to those expenses in excess of those
    available to the insured under those other coverages.</p>

    policy at issue in <i>Baker v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia </i>(1994),
    93 B.C.L.R. (2d) 112 (S.C.) was similarly clear. The insured in that case
    had been injured in an accident in the state of Washington. At the time he
    drove a motor vehicle that was owned by his father and covered by the Insurance
    Corporation of British Columbia owner’s certificate of insurance issued to
    his father. In addition the plaintiff insured’s father had acquired on behalf
    of his son a policy of insurance issued by Lloyd’s of London, which by its
    terms provided “Excess Hospital/Medical for Canadian Residents” coverage.
    The plaintiff was therefore an insured under both the ICBC policy and the
    Lloyd’s policy. The lone issue in that case was whether the medical expenses
    incurred by the plaintiff in the State of Washington were recoverable solely
    from either Lloyd’s or ICBC or from both of them.</p>

    terms of the Lloyd’s policy make it plain that the Lloyd’s coverage is ‘excess’ insurance,
    and in particular that the coverage for hospital and medical expenses is
    excess to the amount payable or recoverable under any ‘provincial auto insurance
    plan.’”</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    language in the RBC policy before the court is of a more general nature (in
    relation to auto coverage) than was the language in either <i>Travel Insurance</i>, <i>supra</i> or <i>Baker

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motions judge concluded that the wording of the RBC policy did not support
    a finding that the RBC policy was an excess policy. In his reasons in reference
    to the <i>Baker v. ICRC </i>decision he concluded:  “RBC makes no specific
    reference to a
    “provincial auto insurance plan” and [as] that phrase is specifically referred
    to in paragraph 15 of the decision, clearly [it was] a significant factor
    in the court’s determination that the Lloyd’s policy was excess to the Provincial
    auto insurance plan.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    then turned to the policy in issue and reasoned:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>But for the
    use of the word “excess” in paragraph 3 on page 18 of the RBC policy and
    in General Condition 6 on page 41, included in a 22 word closing of one paragraph
    in the former and 29 words in the latter, I see no specific reference to
    an overall intention in the 46 pages of the RBC policy to alert the reader,
    clearly and in the first instance, the insured, that the premiums to be paid
    for the coverage afforded by the RBC policy are to buy an excess coverage
    applicable in circumstances of a case such as the one at bar. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            I
    do not find the wording of General Condition 3 clearly supports the view
    that the RBC issued an excess coverage policy. At best, that condition is
    neutral to the determination.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            On
    the whole of the policy, I do not find a clear intent expressed, not in the
    title of the contract nor in the text of the policy language, to justify
    the conclusion urged upon me by RBC. If the insurer had so intended, it would
    have been an easy task to so say, as apparently was the situation in the
    language of the policy interpreted by Justice Lane in the <i>Travel Insurance</i> case
    which he found provided second payor coverage by its terms.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    other words, he concluded that the language of the RBC policy was not sufficient
    to make that policy a “second payor” or excess policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    respectfully disagree with that conclusion. While the language of the RBC
    policy is perhaps not quite as “clear” as was the language in <i>Travel Insurance</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    it is nevertheless my view that, properly interpreted, the RBC policy provides
    excess coverage. To hold otherwise would be to ignore the plain language
    of the policy as set out in paragraphs 15 through 18 of these reasons as
    well as those in paragraphs 39 and 40 below.</p>

    coverage clause reads:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>This insurance

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All

line-height:normal'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, these clauses cannot be ignored and their plain meaning leads to
    the conclusion that the travel policy provides excess coverage where other
    coverage exists for the same loss. To hold otherwise is to ignore these provisions.</p>

line-height:normal'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Aviva
    argues that by reason of section 268(6) of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, its

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    as Lane J. pointed out in <i>Travel Insurance</i>, <i>supra </i>at para.

    bound to provide ‘first dollar coverage.’”</p>

line-height:normal'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
