lang=EN-US> of the Superior Court of Justice dated March 7, 2006.</span></h4>
  <h2>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Avvro Developments Inc. appeals the order declaring
    that an agreement of purchase and sale of land was valid and that the
    purchasers, the Roppos, were entitled to the remedy of specific performance and
    damages. The appellant raises five arguments on the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, it says that the application judge should have
    found that there was no completed agreement because the terms of the contract
    cannot be ascertained with certainty and the parties were not <i>ad idem</i>. In essence, the appellant
    argues that the court cannot be sure whether the terms of the agreement are
    found in the February 27, 2003 document, or in that document together with the
    March 5, 2003 memorandum.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge found that the February 27
    document (the APS sent back by the respondents), which was accepted by a letter
    by the appellant, constitutes the agreement. The additional terms contained in
    the March 5 memorandum were not similarly accepted, so that while Mrs. Roppo
    may have thought it was included in the agreement, it was not. The finding that
    the terms of the agreement are set out in the February 27 document was
    available to the application judge on this record, and there is no basis to
    interfere with it. Those terms are clear and constitute the contract. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the appellant says that these terms are no more
    than a non-binding agreement to agree. We disagree. The essential terms of the
    land sale contract are all there. Any subsequent recording of these terms in a
    more formalized way does not negate their binding effect prior to that.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the appellant says that the contract is void
    because the November 30, 2003, closing date passed without the required
    planning approval. However, the application judge found as a fact that both
    sides proceeded on the basis that November 30 was simply a suggested closing
    date and that closing would take place after the requisite approvals had been
    obtained. They conducted themselves accordingly. This finding is unassailable
    and is a complete answer to this argument.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, the appellant says that the respondents cannot
    establish the uniqueness of the property for which specific performance was
    ordered. Again, the findings of fact answer this assertion. This property was
    unique in being vacant, and in being one on which the respondents had the right
    to construct a new house, using the builder of their choice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifth, the appellant says that for the other two
    properties covered by the contract, damages should have been calculated as of
    the date of its breach by unlawful repudiation, rather than as at the date of
    judgment. It says that if this is so, the respondents also failed to mitigate following
    the breach. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree. Although a departure from the norm, it is
    open to the court to depart from the date of breach when fixing the date for
    calculation of damages, provided always that it is reasonable to do so. Here at
    the date of breach, planning approval had not yet been obtained. Part of the
    value contracted for was the enhancement in the value of the property up to the
    point of that approval, when closing would take place. Therefore, it is
    undoubtedly reasonable to compensate the respondents so as to include that
    portion of the enhancement from breach up to the date of judgment. This being
    so, no issue of mitigation prior to judgment need be considered. Moreover, the
    appellant led no evidence of the absence of reasonable mitigation efforts by
    the respondents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal must therefore be dismissed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs to the respondents fixed at $14,000.00 inclusive
    of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
