    is required to make from $1054 per month to $1613 per month retroactive to
    February 25, 2005. In addition, the January motion judge ordered the appellant
    to pay s. 7 expenses totalling $13,500 on account of university costs for
    two children plus spousal support of $2200 per month retroactive to February
    25, 2005. A motion brought by the appellant for leave to appeal the January

lang=EN-US>      In making the March 22, 2006 order, the motion judge accepted
      the January motion judge’s finding that income of $100,000 per year should
      be imputed to the appellant. However, she also recognized that the January
      25, 2006 order created substantial arrears and that, because the appellant
      is an undischarged bankrupt, he “has no property and no ability to borrow
      institutionally.” In light of these factors, she said she was not satisfied
      that the appellant “has the ability to immediately comply with the existing
      order.” </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>However,
      the motion judge also noted that the appellant had been able to borrow
      some funds for legal fees from relatives and his girlfriend. In addition,
      the motion judge said, “he has had over a year’s holiday from spousal support
      payments while the support motion was pending, so he should have been making
      some contingency plans to deal with the possibility that he would have
      some support arrears.” </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>      In our view, the motion judge was correct in concluding that
      she should consider the appellant’s ability to make all of the payments
      required under the January 25, 2006 order. Because the January motion judge
      did not make a specific finding concerning the appellant’s ability to pay
      immediately the retroactive arrears of child and spousal support created
      by his order and the lump sum s. 7 expenses, it was necessary that the
      motion judge determine that issue before making an order that might effectively
      end the appellant’s right to participate in the proceeding. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>     However, in our
    view, <span lang=EN-US>the motion judge erred in implicitly holding that
    the appellant could and should have set aside money to allow him to pay lump
    sum amounts on account of retroactive support. </span>As the motion judge
    noted, given<span lang=EN-US> the appellant’s status as an undischarged bankrupt,
    he was not in a position to own property. In these circumstances, we fail
    to see how he could properly have made a “contingency plan” to pay any significant
    amount on account of retroactive support. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In
      addition, in our view, the motion judge erred in failing to consider the
      annualized amount of the payments required under paragraphs 3, 4 and 5
      of her order and the appellant’s ability to pay when considered in that
      light. T</span>he combined effect of paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of the March
      22, 2006 order is to bar the appellant from participating further in this
      proceeding unless he makes payments in excess of $80,000 on an annualized
      basis,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a> or
      approximately 80% of his gross annual income.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Particularly
    because the appellant is currently unable to own property, in <span lang=EN-US>our
    view, the motion judge should have assessed the appellant’s ability to pay
    the amounts ordered more specifically by reference to his annual income and
    his proper monthly expenses. In the absence of such an analysis, we are not
    satisfied that the appellant has the present ability to comply with paragraphs
    3, 4, and 5 of the order dated March 22, 2006.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    we reject the appellant’s submission that the motion judge erred in requiring
    the appellant to comply with the January 25, 2006 order for ongoing periodic
    support payments. There was no basis for the motion judge to go behind the
    order made on January 25, 2006 concerning the appellant’s imputed income.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the oral hearing of this appeal, the appellant sought to vary his position
    on appeal from the positions taken in his factum and notice of appeal. The
    thrust of the appellant’s position was that he should be able to proceed
    to trial and to seek further relief in this proceeding without any payment
    conditions. We reject that submission. </p>
