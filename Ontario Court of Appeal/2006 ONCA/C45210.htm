    Inc. (“KPMG”), the respondent receiver and manager, successfully moved for
    a declaration that an option held by the appellants, Paul Albert Wolscht
    and the late Mary Lou Wolscht, by her estate trustee, Paul Albert Wolscht
    (“Wolscht”), to purchase certain lands under the administration of KPMG was
    void and of no force or effect.  Wolscht’s cross-motion for relief validating
    the option to purchase, which included a plea for rectification, was dismissed.  As
    a result, Wolscht is required to vacate the home he and his family have occupied
    for some thirty-eight years. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Wolscht
    appeals the decision of the motion judge and asserts that the option agreement
    is valid and enforceable and complies with the <i>Planning Act, </i>R.S.O.
    1990, c. P.13.  Alternatively, Wolscht submits that the option agreement should
    be rectified so that it complies with the <i>Planning Act. </i></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1968, Wolscht acquired a seventy-four acre farm in Mount Albert, Ontario.  Since
    then, the Wolscht family has continuously resided on a certain parcel of
    this farmland (the “Residential Parcel”), which is the subject of this dispute.  Paul
    Albert Wolscht is now seventy-three years of age.  His spouse died in October
    2005.  Together they raised five children in the two residences that are
    situated on the residential parcel. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    May 1988, Wolscht sold the entire seventy-four acre farmland to Brian Corbett
    for $850,000 (the “Purchase Agreement”).  The Purchase Agreement contains
    an addendum that was allegedly drafted to allow Wolscht to acquire title
    to the farm’s Residential Parcel if the rest of the property was ever subdivided.  The
    transaction was completed on October 27, 1988, at which time the title to
    the property was taken by 787266 Ontario Limited (“787”), a nominee of Mater’s
    Management Ltd. (“Mater’s”).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the closing of the acquisition of the Wolscht farmland in October 1988, 787
    and Wolscht executed a Tenancy and Option to Purchase Agreement (the “Option
    Agreement”), which is central to this appeal.  It was not registered against
    title until January 13, 2003.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1988, Mater’s mortgaged the land in favour of the Morgan Trust Company of
    Canada (“Morgan Trust”) in the principle sum of $3,000,000 and subsequently
    fell into receivership.  In 1990, Morgan Trust, as trustee for individuals
    who invested in the mortgage, successfully moved for an order appointing
    KPMG receiver and manager of 787 and all of the other corporate members of
    Mater’s.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1991, KPMG entered into an agreement with Law Development (Mount Albert)
    Limited (“Law Development”) to develop certain of Mater’s lands in Mount
    Albert, including the seventy-four acre Wolscht farmland.  Law Development
    never actually developed the lands, but in 2001 assigned the right to develop
    to 1422754 Ontario Limited (“Beaverbrook Homes”).  Beaverbrook Homes has
    since developed a portion of the lands, and has registered a plan of sub-division
    that includes the Wolscht farmland. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the Wolschts first raised the Option Agreement by letter dated January
    8, 2003, approximately 15 years after the date on which the Option Agreement
    was executed.  KPMG, Law Development, and Beaverbrook Homes believed the
    Option Agreement to be void and successfully moved for a declaration to that
    effect in June 2005. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge held that the Option Agreement contravenes s. 50 of the <i>Planning
    Act</i>, because it creates an equitable interest in the optioned land while
    purporting to allow the grantor to retain the abutting lands.  The motion
    judge further concluded that the contravention is not remedied by s. 50(21)
    of the <i>Planning Act</i>.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    background facts are generally not in dispute.  Rather, what is disputed
    is the interpretation to be given to the various documents that made up the
    sale of the Wolscht property to 787.  The issues on this appeal are, whether
    the motion judge correctly:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1. held that the Option Agreement contravenes s.
    50 of the <i>Planning Act</i> and is accordingly void and of no force or
    effect; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2. refused to rectify the Option Agreement to contain
    an express condition pursuant to s. 50(21) of the <i>Planning Act</i>; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3. <span> </span>concluded that the Option Agreement
    is void because it fails to provide a mechanism by which Wolscht could specifically
    enforce the option during its term; and, </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4. <span> </span>held that the Option Agreement
    is void due to uncertainty of its terms, namely, the description of the property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, this appeal can be disposed of by the first two issues only.  That
    is, even assuming that the Option Agreement is not void, but rather that
    it amounts to a valid option, it still does not comply with the requirements
    of the <i>Planning Act</i>, nor can it be rectified so that it does comply.  Accordingly,
    although it may appear to some to be a harsh result, I conclude, for the
    reasons that follow, that the motion judge made no error and the appeal from
    his decision must be dismissed.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    propose to deal with the issues in the following order.  First, I will examine
    the Option Agreement and its non-compliance with s. 50 of the <i>Planning
    Act</i>.  I will then address why reading the Option Agreement together with
    the Purchase Agreement does not remedy the <i>Planning Act</i> contravention.  And
    finally, I will explain why rectification is not available to the appellants. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants’ principle submission in this case is that the Option Agreement
    meets the requirements of s. 50(3).  Alternatively, they argue that the Option
    Agreement alone, or read together with the Purchase Agreement, provides an
    exception to the <i>Planning Act</i>.  That is, they argue that these documents
    together establish that all the parties intended to enter into a legal and
    binding contract concerning specifically defined property, and moreover,
    demonstrate that the <i>Planning Act</i> was to be complied with. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(i)             Does the Option
      Agreement contravene s. 50 of the <i>Planning Act</i>?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Option Agreement provides an option to purchase two houses existing on the
    property conveyed by Wolscht to 787 and two acres “immediately subjacent
    thereto”.  It does not include a sketch or description of the boundaries
    of the property to be conveyed.  The material portion of the Option Agreement
    provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Vendors shall be entitled to an option to purchase
    the two houses existing on the lands conveyed by them to the Purchaser, together
    with the two acres immediately subjacent thereto, forthwith after registration
    of any plan of subdivision on the lands, or the severance of the lands, or
    for a period of twenty years from the date hereof, whichever shall first
    occur, at an option price of $2.00 per house and lot, if the lots are then
    separated, or at an option price of $2.00 if the houses remain on one lot.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    50 of the <i>Planning Act</i> controls the subdivision of land in Ontario.   Section
    50(3)(b) provides that “no person shall convey” any interest in land where
    such person retains an interest in “any land abutting the land that is being
    conveyed or otherwise dealt with”, unless the abutting land “is the whole
    of one or more lots or blocks within one or more registered plans of subdivision.”  Non-compliance
    with the <i>Planning</i> <i>Act </i>is fatal to an agreement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    agreement in contravention of s. 50(3)(b) may be remedied by s. 50(21) of
    the Act, which provides that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>An agreement, conveyance, mortgage or charge made,
    or a power of appointment granted, assigned or exercised in contravention
    of this section or a predecessor thereof does not create or convey any interest
    in land, <i>but this section does not affect an agreement entered into subject
    to the express condition contained therein that such agreement is to be effective
    only if the provisions of this section are complied with</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Dical
      Investments Ltd. v. Morrison </i>(1990), 75 O.R. (2d) 417 at 423-424 (C.A.),
      leave to appeal to the S.C.C. refused [1991] 3 S.C.R. v, this court held
      that options to purchase are subject to the application of s. 50(3) of
      the <i>Planning Act</i>.   In this case 787 purchased all seventy-four
      acres of the Wolscht property and then granted an option to purchase back
      two acres of the property to the Wolschts while retaining abutting lands
      that are not the whole of one or more lots or blocks within a registered
      plan of subdivision.  The Option Agreement is therefore in violation of
      s. 50(3) of the <i>Planning Act</i>.  Accordingly, the motion judge was
      correct in deciding this issue as he did. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge also held that the Option Agreement is not remedied by s. 50(21)
    of the Act because it does not expressly <span
lang=EN-US>stipulate that the agreement is to be effective only if the provisions
    of s. 50 of the <i>Planning Act </i>are complied with</span>.  Again, he
    was correct.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Dical</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at 425, this court held that the term “express condition” in s. 50(21) of
    the <i>Planning Act</i> must be given its plain meaning.  This conclusion
    explains the court’s earlier narrow construction of the term at 424: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The impugned option contains no reference to s.
    49 [now s. 50] of the <i>Planning Act</i>, <i>1983</i> nor does it contain
    an “express condition” that the option is to be effective only if the provisions
    of s. 49 are complied with.  The provisions of the <i>Planning Act</i>, <i>1983 </i>preclude
    a court from finding that the parties, by <i>impliedly</i> agreeing to make
    their contract effective only on compliance with s. 49, can circumvent the “express” provision
    requirement.  See <i>Nepean Carleton Developments Ltd. v. Hope</i>, [1978]
    1 S.C.R. 427, 71 D.L.R. (3d) 609, 13 N.R. 7, at p. 431 S.C.R.  In the present
    case, since the necessary “express condition” is absent from the option,
    it cannot be implied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    50(21) of the <i>Planning Act </i>therefore remedies an agreement that contravenes
    the Act only where the agreement is subject to an express condition contained
    therein “that such agreement is to be effective only if the provisions of
    [s.50] are complied with.”   The Option Agreement, by itself, does not contain
    such an express condition and consequently is not remedied by s. 50(21) of
    the Act. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants argue that this court ought to undertake a
    “purposive approach” to the interpretation of the <i>Planning Act</i>, consistent
    with the dissenting opinion in <i>Dical</i>.  Respectfully, I reject this
    argument given that the majority in <i>Dical</i> overruled the authorities
    that were relied upon in the dissenting opinion, and which are now relied
    upon by the appellants in this appeal.  </p>

    the within case, the words “in accordance with the Agreement of Purchase
    and Sale”, in my view, are too general and fall short of being sufficiently
    clear to meet the test.  That is, the words do not provide notice of which
    terms of the Purchase Agreement were to be incorporated into the Option Agreement.
    The notice therefore does not enable a reasonable person to conclude that
    the Option Agreement contained an express condition pursuant to s. 50(21)
    of the <i>Planning Act</i>.  I rely on the following reasons in support of
    this conclusion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is clear from the Purchase Agreement and the addendum in the Purchase Agreement
    that Wolscht and 787 intended to ensure that Wolscht could obtain certain
    houses and land after a contemplated severance or subdivision.  Moreover,
    the Option Agreement plainly intended that Wolscht was to continue to occupy
    the houses and land as described, even though 787 owned the entire seventy-four
    acres.  Nevertheless, in my view, the motion judge was correct in holding
    that Clause 12 in the Purchase Agreement refers to the sale of the seventy-four
    acres of land as opposed to the land described in the Option Agreement, and
    that the Option Agreement was entered into following the Purchase Agreement.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    agree with KPMG’s position that the definitions of the terms in Clause 12
    make it impossible to relate it to the subsequent completion of a purchase
    by Wolscht pursuant to the Option Agreement.  Wolscht is the vendor under
    the Purchase Agreement and the purchaser under the Option Agreement, whereas
    787 is the purchaser under the Purchase Agreement and the vendor under the
    Option Agreement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Clause
    12 of the Purchase Agreement therefore clearly relates to the completion
    of the sale of “the property”, defined therein as all seventy-four acres
    of the Wolscht property, and not to the optioned property.  It relates to
    the completion of the sale by the “Vendor”, defined in the Purchase Agreement
    as Paul and Mary Lou Wolscht.  Accordingly, this provision cannot provide
    the express condition required by s. 50(21) of the <i>Planning Act</i> to
    remedy the Option Agreement.  I would therefore dismiss this ground of appeal. </p>

    R.P.R. 344 (H.C.J.), upheld [1977] O.J. No. 800 (C.A.), is of no assistance.  Unlike
    in the case at bar, the court in <i>Marcrob</i> found that notice had been

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    order to obtain rectification of a term of a contract, Wolscht must establish
    that all of the parties were in complete agreement as to the terms of their
    contract, but wrote them down incorrectly: <i>H.F. Clarke Ltd. v. Thermidaire
    Corp. Ltd.</i> (1973), 33 D.L.R. (3d) 13 at 20-21 (Ont. C.A.), reversed on
    other grounds (1974), 54 D.L.R. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.).  Clear and compelling
    evidence is required to show that the written contract does not correspond
    with a prior oral agreement.  The Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Sylvan Lake
    Golf &amp; Tennis Club Ltd. v. Performance Industries Ltd.</i> (2002), 209
    D.L.R. (4) 318 at 330 (S.C.C.) articulated the principle as:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Rectification is predicated on the existence of
    a prior oral contract whose terms are definite and ascertainable.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
    plaintiff must establish that the terms agreed to orally were not written
    down properly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    appellants provided no evidence, either in the form of written documents
    or sworn statements, that the parties had a prior agreement to reference
    the <i>Planning Act</i> in the Option Agreement, but mistakenly did not do
    so.  At its highest, the evidence is that Wolscht believed that the Option
    Agreement would allow him to obtain title to the area described as the Residential
    Parcel and that the Wolschts relied on their lawyer in this respect.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence in this case falls far short of that which is necessary to support
    the claim for rectification.  The evidence does not support a finding that
    Wolscht and 787 made a prior oral agreement to condition the effectiveness
    of the Option Agreement on compliance with s. 50 of the <i>Planning Act</i>.  Once
    again, the motion judge was correct on this issue. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.  Disposing of the appeal in this
    fashion renders it unnecessary to decide whether the Option Agreement is
    void for lack of an enforcement mechanism in favour of Wolscht or for uncertainty
    of its terms.</p>
