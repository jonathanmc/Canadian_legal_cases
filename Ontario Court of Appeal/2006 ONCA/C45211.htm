  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment
      of Justice R. T. P. Gravely of the Superior Court of Justice dated March
      9, 2006.</span></h4>
  <h2>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant is the landlord of a small commercial plaza and the respondent,
    which is one of its tenants, operates a gas bar in the plaza.  By way of
    notice of application, the tenant sought an interpretation of the lease with
    respect to two issues.  The only issue that is under appeal is whether the
    provisions of the lease require the tenant to share in the landlord’s costs
    for maintenance of the common facilities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge found that the tenant was not required to share these costs.  On
    his interpretation of the lease, he found that the tenant was required to
    pay its propor-tionate share of the landlord’s costs for maintenance of the
    common facilities.  However, he went on to find that the lease had been amended
    by the parties’ subsequent course of conduct with the result that the tenant
    was not required to share in the landlord’s costs for maintenance of the
    common facilities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    landlord contests part of the application judge’s judgment.  It submits that
    the trial judge correctly interpreted the lease, but appeals on the ground
    that he erred in finding that the lease was amended by the subsequent course
    of conduct of the parties, with the result that the tenant would be required
    to share in the landlord’s costs for maintenance of the common facilities.  The
    tenant cross-appeals from the application judge’s interpretation of the lease.  It
    contends that the lease, properly interpreted, does not require that it share
    in the landlord’s maintenance costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    we agree with the result of the application, we do not agree with the application
    judge’s interpretation of the lease or with his conclusion that the lease
    was amended by the subsequent conduct of the parties.  In our view, the interpretation
    of the lease advanced by the tenant is correct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    way of background, the application judge made the following findings of fact
    that are relevant to the interpretation of the lease:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>because
    the tenant’s gas bar is separate and apart from the plaza’s main building,
    its arrangements with the landlord were different from those of the other
    tenants;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    tenant has always paid separate metered utilities, its own insurance premiums
    and its own heating and ventilation costs;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    two prior landlords did not request payment of the tenant’s share for maintenance
    costs of the common facilities from the tenant, nor did the tenant pay such
    costs;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    tenant paid its proportionate share of municipal taxes;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    tenant’s acknowledgement of lease provided to the landlord on its purchase
    of the plaza confirmed that the tenant was not required to pay its share
    for main-tenance costs of the common facilities.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>In our view, these facts support,
    and are consistent with, the proper interpretation of the lease.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the tenant that the lease is unambiguous.  In reading Articles
    4.2(c) and 6.1(a) of the lease, together with Schedule “C” and the definition
    of “premises” in Article 1.1, it is clear that the tenant’s obligation with
    respect to maintenance costs applies only to its gas bar, which is separate
    and apart from the main building and the common facilities.  Consequently,
    the tenant is not required to share in the landlord’s costs for maintenance
    of the common facilities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the true intent of the tenant and the original landlord when they entered
    into the lease is evident by the parties’ conduct in the subsequent five
    years before the landlord acquired the plaza, during which the tenant did
    not contribute to the landlord’s costs of maintaining the common facilities.  As
    well, the interpretation of the lease urged by the landlord does not make
    commercial sense.  It would require the tenant to contribute a proportionate
    share of the landlord’s maintenance costs of the common facilities, while
    at the same time paying all maintenance costs related to its premises without
    contribution from the other tenants of the plaza.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    we agree that the lease, properly interpreted, does not require the tenant
    to share in the landlord’s costs for maintenance of the common facilities,
    it is unnecessary to consider whether the lease was amended by the subsequent
    conduct of the parties to achieve the same result.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, we would dismiss the landlord’s appeal and allow the tenant’s
    cross-appeal.  Accordingly, we would set aside the order of the application
    judge and grant an order in accordance with these reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    have agreed on costs in the amount of $8,000 payable to the respondent, inclusive
    of costs and GST.</p>
