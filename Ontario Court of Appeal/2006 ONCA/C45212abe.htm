style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is a Crown appeal from the decision of the Summary Conviction Appeal Judge
    ordering a new trial. For reasons that follow, we would allow the appeal
    and restore the conviction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    the extent that the Summary Conviction Appeal Judge may have felt that the
    s.&nbsp;16 competence inquiry was inadequate, we disagree. While we acknowledge
    that the inquiry was brief, it showed that the complainant could observe,
    recollect and communicate and that she understood the difference between
    the truth and a lie and she confirmed that she would tell the truth. Nothing
    more was required.  In this regard, we note that the defence raised no objection.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the issue of the medical evidence, the trial judge disclosed a proper understanding
    of the complainant’s evidence on the issue of penetration. The trial judge
    found the import of her testimony to be that “the defendant put his private
    in or near her private”. That finding was fully supported by the evidence
    and the Summary Conviction Appeal Judge should have deferred to it. Had he
    done so, he would not have found an inconsistency between the complainant’s
    evidence and Dr. Boyer’s evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent further submits that the trial judge failed to give adequate reasons
    for accepting the complainant’s evidence in the face of a number of alleged
    inconsistencies that he should have, but did not address.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    rejecting this ground, we note that the written submissions to the trial
    judge, filed on behalf of the respondent, did not focus on these inconsistencies.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s reasons were largely responsive to the issues raised. He gave
    cogent reasons for rejecting the evidence of the respondent and he explained
    why it was that he accepted the complainant’s evidence. In particular, he
    noted that her testimony was “clear and forthcoming”, that her description
    of what occurred was “in age appropriate language and style” and significantly,
    that there was “no hint of her having been coached”. This assessment of her
    credibility, when taken together with her spontaneous and unprompted complaint
    to her mother, was, in our view, sufficient to explain and justify the trial
    judge’s willingness to act on her evidence. While it might have been preferable
    had he addressed some of the alleged inconsistencies, we are not persuaded
    that his failure to do so was fatal in the circumstances. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    leave to appeal is granted, the decision for the Summary Conviction Appeal
    Judge is set aside and the conviction is resorted.</p>
