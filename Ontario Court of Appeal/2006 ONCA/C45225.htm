  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the order of
      Justice Farley of the Superior Court of Justice dated March 7, 2006.</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants are the holders of certain Convertible Notes of Stelco.  They
    seek to set aside the order of Farley J. dated March 7, 2006, which they
    describe as imposing “an expedited, summary ‘CCAA-style’ claims process” for
    the determination of certain inter-creditor claims in the Stelco restructuring.  They
    assert that the order was made without jurisdiction either under the CCAA
    or through the exercise of the court’s inherent jurisdiction, and that the
    order deprives them of their rights to require those who wish to assert Subordination
    Claims as against other Stelco creditors to prove those claims in a ordinary
    civil lawsuit with all the bells and whistles that go with such a proceeding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents say that the March 7 order was a discretionary, interlocutory,
    scheduling order made in the course of the CCAA proceedings by the experienced
    supervising judge, familiar with those proceedings, and that the decision
    should be granted deference and left in place.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the respondents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Stelco restructuring Plan under the CCAA was negotiated and approved by all
    creditors – including the appellant Convertible Noteholders and the respondent
    Senior Bondholders.  It was sanctioned by Justice Farley on January 20, 2006.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Plan establishes a pool of cash, warrants, and securities of various kinds
    for purposes of satisfying the claims of Stelco’s creditors.  These are known
    as the
    “Turnover Proceeds”.  Distributions cannot be made out of the pool in relation
    to the Convertible Noteholders and the Senior Bondholders until the issue
    of the latter’s subordination claims has been determined.  This is because
    the instruments establishing the rights of the Convertible Noteholders and
    the Senior Bondholders provide that the latter are entitled to be paid in
    full before the former can recover anything.  Thus, it is necessary to fix
    the Senior Bondholder’s claim – which in turn requires a valuation of the
    securities in the pool – to determine the respective distributions from the
    Turnover Proceeds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    6.01(2) of the Plan specifically provides that the Plan is not to prejudice
    the rights of the holders of the Senior Debt to pursue their subordination
    claims or the rights of the Convertible Noteholders to raise any defences.  “In
    that regard”, it then stipulates that the Monitor (who holds the Turnover
    Proceeds) will apply within 30 days of the Plan Implementation Date for an
    order “seeking directions in respect of a process to determine <i>on a timely
    basis</i> entitlements to the Turnover Proceeds”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants are creditors of Stelco and at least some of them participated
    in the negotiation of the Plan.  In any event they voted on approval and
    the Plan was approved and is binding on them. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    short, the parties negotiated as part of the Plan, and agreed to – and the
    Court sanctioned -- a mechanism for resolving “entitlements to the Turnover
    Proceeds”.  That is what this dispute is about. The evidence before Farley
    J. indicated that a significant portion of the Turnover Proceeds consists
    of potentially volatile marketable securities that could not be traded until
    this dispute is resolved.  The procedure created by Farley J. reflects this
    dynamic of the Stelco process and responds to the particular exigencies of
    this restructuring.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Macdonald argues that the appellants should be entitled to their full rights
    of process under the Rules of Civil Procedure and to put the respondents
    to compliance with the Class Proceedings Act.  We do not agree.  That is
    not what the Plan calls for, nor is it what we would expect in the context
    of a complicated and time-driven CCAA proceeding such as the Stelco restructuring.  The
    Plan contemplates <i>directions</i> with respect to a <i>process to determine </i>entitlements
    to the Turnover Proceeds<i> on a timely basis</i>.  If the parties and the
    Court had intended the subordination claims issue to be resolved by way of
    a regular lawsuit, they would simply have said so or left the Convertible
    Noteholders and the Senior Bondholders to their normal remedies.  They did
    not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is not a pure inter-creditor dispute that is unconnected to the debtor, Stelco.  It
    is a dispute that invokes – at least insofar as the subordination claims
    that have to be resolved for purposes of distribution of the Turnover Proceeds
    are concerned –
    the provisions of the Plan and the court’s control of its own process in
    relation to matters pertaining to the roll out of the Plan.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    the circumstances differ from those involved in either of the two prior Stelco
    cases to which we were referred.  In <i>Re Stelco</i> (2005), 75 O.R. (3d)
    5 (C.A.) – the directors case – the court was dealing with a matter relating
    to the company’s role in the restructuring process as opposed to the court’s
    role in the restructuring process.  The present case pertains to the court’s
    control over the restructuring process.  In <i>Re Stelco</i>, [2005] O.J.
    No. 4883 (C.A.) – the classification case – the court observed that it is
    not a proper use of a CCAA proceeding to determine disputes between parties
    other than the debtor company.  As pointed out above, however, the present
    case is not simply an inter-creditor dispute that does not involve the debtor
    company; it is a dispute that is inextricably connected to the restructuring
    process. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Monitor duly applied to the Court, as required, and Farley J., exercising
    his jurisdiction as the supervising judge of the Stelco restructuring put
    a timely process in place – in CCAA Commercial List fashion –
    to resolve the entitlements to the Turnover Proceeds.  His jurisdiction over
    the process of the CCAA restructuring extends at least to continued process-related
    matters concerning the rollout of the Plan in accordance with its provisions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Farley
    J. is entitled to considerable deference in respect of this type of discretionary
    decision, which, as the respondent submits, is in the nature of an interlocutory,
    scheduling order.   We see no basis for interfering with his order</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is dismissed.</p>

    respondent Informal Committee of Senior Debenture Holders is entitled to
    the costs of the motion before Labrosse J.A., fixed at $500.00, and to the
    costs of the appeal, fixed in the total amount of $12,500.00 inclusive of
