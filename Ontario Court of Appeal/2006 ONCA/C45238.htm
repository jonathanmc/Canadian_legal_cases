    appellant was convicted of one count of criminal harassment of his former
    common-law partner contrary to s. 264(2)(b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  This
    was his third offence involving the same victim.  He was sentenced to thirty
    days concurrent to an existing sentence.  He was also sentenced to three
    years probation, also concurrent with an existing probation order.  The sentencing
    judge imposed the following probation condition: “Forthwith or in any event
    within two weeks of release leave the province of Ontario immediately.”</p>

    probation that amounts to banishment. <ins
cite="mailto:soobraa" datetime="2006-09-20T10:39"> </ins>In his reasons for sentence,
    the sentencing judge stated that he did not consider this “to be an injudicious
    exile” because the appellant had stated that he wanted to end his relationship
    with the victim and that upon release he intended to leave the jurisdiction
    and return to the Maritimes.  The sentencing judge added that this was a
    serious offence and that the appellant’s “continuation within a community
    such as Napanee/Kingston area, in Ontario, will cause [the victim and her
    children] to be constantly in fear of his presence.”  The sentencing judge
    added that it would be open to the appellant to apply to vary the condition
    if he received employment in some other part of Ontario.</p>

    appellant submits that banishment from Ontario cannot be justified as a condition
    of the probation order under s. 732.1(3)(h):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(3) The court
    may prescribe, as additional conditions of a probation order, that the offender
    do one or more of the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>(h) comply with such other reasonable conditions as the court
    considers desirable, subject to any regulations made under subsection 738(2),
    for protecting society and for facilitating the offender’s successful reintegration
    into the community.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the <i>Criminal Code</i> specifies that conditions of probation should facilitate “the
    offender’s successful reintegration into the community”, banishment remains
    the exception rather than the rule.  It has been said on more than one occasion
    that banishment orders “should not be encouraged”: see <i>R. v. Malboeuf</i> (1982),
    68 C.C.C. (2d) 544 at 547 (Sask. C.A.); <i>R. v. Williams</i>, [1997] B.C.J.
    No. 2101 at para. 9 (B.C. C.A.).  As a member of the Manitoba Court of Appeal,
    Dickson J.A. frowned on the practice of banishment in <i>R. v. Fuller</i>,
    [1969] 3 C.C.C. 348 at 351:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In Canada communities
    are interdependent and relations between them should be marked by mutual
    respect and understanding.  A practice whereby one community seeks to rid
    itself of undesirables by foisting them off on other communities violates
    this basic concept of consideration for the rights of others and should not
    be tolerated.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the other hand, orders banishing an offender from a specific community have
    been made against estranged spouses with a view to protect<ins cite="mailto:Sharpe" datetime="2006-09-21T09:10">ing</ins> the
    victim or to assist<ins cite="mailto:Sharpe" datetime="2006-09-21T09:10">ing</ins> with
    the offender’s rehabilitation: see e.g. <i>R. v. Stack</i>, [1998] B.C.J.
    No. 1492 (B.C. C.A.); <i>R. v. Peyton</i>,<i> </i>[1996] N.J. No. 120 (Nfld.
    S.C. T.D.). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;&quot;\[%2\:7\:0\:\]&quot; Sharpe 20060920T1018'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Plainly,
    the larger the ambit of the banishment, the more difficult the order will
    be to justify.  In <i>R. v. Brooks</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 105, this court upheld
    a probation term excluding the appellant from Muskoka, but, at para. 1, the
    court stated that it did so “given the appellant’s avowed intention to leave
    that area as a step in his rehabilitative process.”  Banishment from an entire
    province is an extreme measure that could be justified only in exceptional
    circumstances, even in cases of domestic violence.  The only case I have
    been able to uncover that upholds banishment from a province is <i>R. v.
    Banks</i>, [1991] B.C.J. No. 424, where the British Columbia Court of Appeal
    upheld such an order specifically on the ground that the appellant had proposed
    and consented to the condition.  On the other hand, in a case similar to
    the one at bar, <i>R. v. Stulac</i> (1983), 63 N.S.R. (2d) 357 at para. 5,
    the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal struck down a condition requiring an offender
    who had committed an offence against his domestic partner to leave the province
    for the term of his probation as
    “unnecessary to accomplish the purpose of keeping the appellant away from
    the victim”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;&quot;\[%2\:8\:0\:\]&quot; Sharpe 20060920T1018'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the probation term requiring the appellant to leave Ontario upon
    his release from prison cannot be justified as a reasonable measure for the
    protection of society.  Moreover, banishment from the province far exceeds
    what is required to protect the victim.  I note that the offence in the present
    case involved communications by telephone and mail.  Banishment to another
    province will not effectively protect the victim from repetitions of that
    conduct and less drastic restrictions will protect the victim from other
    forms of harassment.  Banishment from the province would be contrary to the
    second factor mentioned in s. 732.1(3)(h),
    “facilitating the offender’s successful reintegration into the community.”  As
    neither of the factors specified in s. 732.1(3)(h) are present, the term
    cannot be justified as a reasonable condition and must be set aside. </p>
