style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    February 1997, the appellant loaned her son, the respondent, the sum of
    $150,000.  By promissory note dated
    February&nbsp;10,&nbsp;1997 (the “Note”), the respondent promised to pay the
    appellant, on demand, the sum of $150,000.  The Note also required the respondent to pay interest at the rate of
    prime plus one&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent per annum.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    respondent last made an interest payment on October&nbsp;26,&nbsp;1998.  No payments in respect of the Note have been
    made since then.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    November 10, 2004, the appellant made a demand for repayment.  She met with no success so, on
    February&nbsp;17,&nbsp;2005, she commenced the present action in which she
    claims all sums due on account of the Note.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    respondent moved for summary judgment.  By order dated April&nbsp;10,&nbsp;2006, Minden&nbsp;J. granted the
    motion and dismissed the appellant’s claim.  He held that the appellant’s action is barred by s.&nbsp;45(1)(g) of the </span><i><span lang=EN-US>Limitations Act</span></i><span lang=EN-US>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.15 (the “former </span><i><span lang=EN-US>Limitations Act</span></i><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    motion judge referred to the appellant’s submission that the new </span><i><span lang=EN-US>Limitations Act </span></i><span lang=EN-US>applied.  His reasons for
    rejecting that submission are extremely brief.  The full text of the reasons in respect of this issue is as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Plaintiff’s principal submission, unsupported
    by any caselaw, concerning the applicability of <i>Limitations Act</i>, 2002, S.O. 2002, c. 24, Sch. B. was premised upon
    the defendant’s refusal to comply with the plaintiff’s November 10, 2004 demand
    letter as constituting the act or omission giving rise to the plaintiff’s
    claim.  As I have said, the authorities
    binding upon me make it clear that it was, rather, the making of the demand
    loan that gave rise to the plaintiff’s claim.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant appeals.  Counsel for the
    appellant notes that, given the paucity of the reasons on the issue of the
    applicability of the new </span><i><span
lang=EN-US>Limitations Act</span></i><span
lang=EN-US>, it is unclear whether the motion
    judge considered its provisions.  If he
    did, the appellant argues that the motion judge erred in concluding that her
    claim arose when the Note was made, rather than when the respondent refused to repay
    the loan after a demand for repayment had been made.  Consequently, the appellant says, the
    limitation period under the new <i>Limitations Act </i>has not expired and her
    claim is not statute-barred.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Before
    addressing these issues, it is useful to consider the result under the former <i>Limitations
    Act</i>. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE RESULT UNDER THE FORMER <i>LIMITATIONS ACT</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>If
    the former </span><i><span lang=EN-US>Limitations Act</span></i><span lang=EN-US> applies, the limitation period expired before
    the action was commenced.  I agree with
    the motion judge who explained this result as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In
    my view, this situation is governed by clear and binding authorities, including
    the Ontario Court of Appeal’s decision in <i>Royal Bank v. Hogg</i>, [1930] 2
    D.L.R. 488, and other cases to the effect that (p. 490) “a demand note matures
    for all purposes as soon as it is delivered”.  See also:  <i>Royal Bank v. Dwigans</i>,
    [1933] 1 W.W.R. 672 (Alta.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    )
    at p.&nbsp;675 and p.&nbsp;677.  In these
    circumstances, where the loan is repayable on demand, s.&nbsp;45(1)(g) of the <i>Limitations
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, C. L.15 applies to bar an action unless commenced
    with[in] 6 years of the funds being advanced; <i>Wilkosz v. Amato</i>, [1999]
    O.J. 1958, at paras. 49 and 50, and <i>Spencer
    Investments Ltd. v. Hansford </i>(1974), 84 D.L.R. (3d) 474, at para.</span>&nbsp;6.  Here, the limitation period was started
    afresh by reason of the last payment [on October 26, 1998]: <i>St. Hillaire et
    al. v. Kravacek et al.</i> (1979), 26 O.R. (2d) 499 (Ont. C.A.).  See also <i>Montreal
    Trust Co. of Canada v. Vanness Estate</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 594 (C.A.) at
    para.&nbsp;2.  Thus, the effective
    limitation period by which this action had to have commenced was October&nbsp;26,&nbsp;2004.  Accordingly, this action commenced
    February&nbsp;17, 2005 is statute barred.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>WHAT EFFECT DOES THE NEW <i>LIMITATIONS ACT</i> HAVE ON THE PRESENT
    ACTION?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The present action was commenced on February 17, 2005,
    after the new <i>Limitations Act </i>came into force on January 1, 2004.  To determine whether the appellant’s claim is
    to be dealt with in accordance with the former or the new <i>Limitations Act</i>,
    recourse must be had to the transition provisions in s. 24 of the new <i>Limitations
    Act</i>.     </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>Section
    24(2) of the new Limitations Act  </span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties argued this appeal on the basis that s.
    24(5) of the new <i>Limitations Act</i> applies.  However, it appears to me that s. 24(2)
    determines whether the transition provisions in s. 24 apply.  Thus, in my view, s. 24(2) must be considered
    before it can be known whether s. 24(5) is applicable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 24(2) provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>24 (2) This section applies to claims based on acts
    or   omissions that took place before the
    effective date and in respect of which no proceeding has been commenced before
    the effective date.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are two conditions in s. 24(2): first, that the
    appellant’s claim is based on an act or omission that took place before January
    1, 2004; and, second, that no proceeding had been commenced in respect of that
    claim before January 1, 2004.  The second
    condition is met as the present action is the only proceeding to have been
    commenced in relation to the Note and it was brought after January 1,
    2004.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, in determining whether the requirements of s.
    24(2) have been met, the only issue is whether the appellant’s claim is based
    on an act or omission that took place before the effective date.  As the demand for payment was made on
    November 10, 2004, a date after the effective date of January 1, 2004, while
    the appellant may argue that she “discovered” her claim after January 1, 2004,
    since she argues on the basis that s. 24(5) applies, she must concede that for
    purposes of s. 24(2), her claim is based on an act or omission that took place
    prior to January 1, 2004.  The only such
    acts are the delivery of the Note on February 10, 1997, the making of the last
    interest payment on October 26, 1998, or the failure to repay the loan prior to
    January 1, 2004, without the necessity of a demand for repayment having been
    made.  As explained below, I agree that
    the act is the delivery of the Note as extended by the making of an interest
    payment.  As those events took place
    before January 1, 2004, s. 24 applies to her claim.       </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>Section
    24(5) of the new Limitations Act</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 24(5) reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>24  (5) If
    the former limitation period did not expire before the effective date and if a
    limitation period under this Act would apply were the claim based on an act or
    omission that took place on or after the effective date, the following rules
    apply:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the claim was not discovered before the effective

  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the claim was discovered before the effective date,
    the former limitation period applies.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>“Effective date” and “former
    limitation period” are defined in s. 24(1), which reads as follows:    </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>24  (1) In
    this section,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            “effective
    date” means the day on which this Act comes into force; (“date de l’entrée en

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            “former
    limitation period” means the limitation period that applied in respect of the
    claim before the coming into force of this Act.  (“ancien delai de prescription”) </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On a plain reading of s. 24(5), its rules apply if two

  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the former limitation period did not expire before

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>Have the

    s.&nbsp;45(1)(g) of the former <i>Limitations Act</i>, was six years.  As the motion judge explained, given that a
    payment had been made in October 1998, that six-year limitation period expired
    in October 2004.  As the former six-year
    limitation period had not expired before January&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2004, the first
    condition is met.   <i></i></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second condition requires a determination as to
    whether a limitation period under the new <i>Limitations Act </i>would apply if
    the appellant’s claim were based on an act or omission that took place after
    January 1, 2004.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties disagree as to what act or omission is the
    basis of the appellant’s claim.  The
    appellant contends that her claim is based on the respondent’s refusal to repay<br

    the loan after demand for repayment had been made.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  The respondent maintains that the appellant’s
    claim is based on the Note.  In my view,
    regardless of which of those views is correct, a limitation period under the
    new <i>Limitations Act </i>would apply and the second condition has been
    met.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 4 of the new <i>Limitations Act </i>creates a
    basic limitation period of two years following the discovery of a claim.  It reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4.         Unless this Act provides otherwise, a proceeding shall not
    be commenced in respect of a claim after the second anniversary of the day on
    which the claim was discovered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None of the exceptions in s. 2 of the new <i>Limitations
    Act </i>apply to a demand promissory note so <i>prima facie </i>the appellant’s
    claim (whether based on default after demand for repayment or the Note) would
    be subject to the two-year limitation period provided for by s. 4.  As discussed below, the appellant’s claim may
    be subject to the fifteen-year ultimate limitation period in s. 15 of the new <i>Limitations
    Act</i>.  However, whether the applicable
    limitation period is two years or fifteen years is immaterial for the purposes
    of the second condition as all that is required is that a limitation period

    as if the act or omission had taken place on January 1, 2004.  Rule 2 provides that if the appellant’s claim
    was discovered before January 1, 2004, the former limitation period applies.  It is readily apparent that in order to
    decide which of the two rules applies, it must be determined when the

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that it was the respondent’s

    the “act or omission” giving rise to her loss and, hence, to her claim.  Thus, the appellant argues that her claim was
    discovered after the demand for repayment was made in November 2004.  As November 2004 falls after January 1, 2004,
    the appellant says that Rule 1 applies.  Rule 1 provides that the new <i>Limitations Act</i> applies as if the
    act or omission had taken place on January 1, 2004.  As the action was commenced in February 2005,
    it was brought in time.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is a great deal of strength to the appellant’s
    position.  The language of the new <i>Limitations
    Act </i>is very different from that of the former <i>Limitations Act</i>.  Where the former <i>Limitations Act </i>speaks
    of “action”, the new legislation speaks of “claims”.  “Claim” is defined in s. 1 of the new <i>Limitations
    Act </i>as “a claim to remedy an injury, loss or damage that occurred as a
    result of an act or omission”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 5 of the new <i>Limitations Act </i>ties the
    discovery of a claim to the notion of “injury, loss or damage”.  Section 5(1) reads as follows:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span

  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(i)        that the injury, loss or damage had
    occurred,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(ii)       that the injury, loss or damage was
    caused by or contributed to by an act or omission,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(iii)     that the act or omission was that of the

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that in the modern commercial
    world, a reasonable lender would not be considered to have suffered “injury,
    loss or damage” until there was a failure to comply with a demand for repayment</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the same reason, several commentators have
    suggested that the new <i>Limitations Act </i>should be interpreted as changing
    the law so that the limitation period would begin to run from the date of
    default of payment, as opposed to from the date of the promissory note.  See, for example, Brian Bucknall, “The
    Limitations Act, 2002 and the Real Property Limitations Act: Some Notes on
    Interpretive Issues” (2004) 29 Advocates’ Q. 1 at 19 – 21.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the Alberta <i>Limitations Act, </i>R.S.A.
    2000, c. L-12 (the “Alberta Act”), has been interpreted so that failure to pay,
    after the demand for repayment has been made, triggers the running of the
    limitation period.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 3(1) of the Alberta Act provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3 (1) Subject to section 11,
    if a claimant does not seek a remedial order within</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) 2 years after the date on which the claimant

  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(i)        that the injury for which the claimant

  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(ii)       that the injury was attributable to

  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(iii)    that the injury, assuming liability on the

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>whichever period expires first, the defendant, on

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 3(1) was interpreted in the context of a claim
    based on a demand loan in <i>Sawchuk v. Bourne</i>, [2004] A.J. No. 526
    (Q.B.).  In <i>Sawchuk</i>, the court
    held that the limitation period started to run when the plaintiff demanded
    payment and the defendant refused to pay.  The court acknowledged that at common law, the cause of action on a
    demand loan runs from the date of the advancement of the loan.  However, the court referred to s. 3(1) of the
    Alberta Act and held that the limitation period began to run not on the date
    the cause of action arose but on the date of injury.  The date of injury was held to be when the
    defendants failed to repay the loan despite a demand having been made.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The order in <i>Sawchuk </i>was appealed but the appeal
    was dismissed for inaction; the defendant’s application to have the appeal

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not find <i>Sawchuk </i>to be helpful in
    construing the new <i>Limitations Act</i>, as the wording of the Alberta Act is
    materially different.  Significantly,
    “injury” is defined in s. 1(e)(iv) of the Alberta Act to include
    “non-performance of an obligation” whereas the new <i>Limitations Act </i>does
    not define “injury, loss or damage”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, I reject the appellant’s argument for
    three reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, to accede to the appellant’s submission, I would
    have to accept that the legislature intended to change the law relating to
    demand notes by means of the new <i>Limitations Act</i>, a piece of legislation
    that is directed at limitation periods, not commercial law.  In my view, it would require very clear
    language evidencing an intention on the part of the legislature to impair
    existing rights before such a construction, which would overturn centuries’ old
    jurisprudence, would be warranted.  As
    the Supreme Court of Canada stated in <i>Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. of Canada
    v. T. Eaton Co</i>., [1956] S.C.R. 610 at 614:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[A] Legislature is not
    presumed to depart from the general system of the law without expressing its
    intention to do so with irresistible clearness, failing which the law remains
    undisturbed.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the language in the new <i>Limitations Act </i>is
    not so “irresistibly clear” that it can be presumed that the legislature
    intended to depart from established commercial law and disturb existing common
    law rights.  <i>  </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the appellant’s interpretation, taken to its
    logical extreme, results in limitless liability.  If a demand for repayment must be made before
    the limitation period would begin to run and no demand is made, the limitation
    period would never begin to run and the claim would exist in perpetuity.  Consequently, liability would exist
    indefinitely.  That is contrary to the
    foundational notions underlying the creation of limitation periods, namely, the
    need for the law to promote finality and certainty in legal affairs and to
    prevent indefinite liability.  When
    considering the undesirability of indefinite liability, the words of this court
    in <i>Deaville v. Boegeman </i>(1984), 48 O.R. (2d) 725 at 729-30 are usefully
    recalled:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>When limitation periods were
    under consideration by the common law courts in the 18th and 19th centuries,
    the judges described these limitation statutes as “statutes of repose” or
    “statutes of peace”.  The emphasis then
    was as it is today, on the necessity of giving security to members of society.  Citizens would not expect to be disturbed
    once the limitation period had expired.  Today when a limitation period has expired it is considered that,
    generally speaking, a defendant need no longer be concerned about the location
    or preservation of evidence relevant to the particular claim or relevant to a
    claim which has not been made.  Further,
    the defendant is, presumably, at that stage free to act and plan his life
    without concern for stale claims or claims of which he has no knowledge which
    have arisen out of the original incident.  When considering the purpose of limitation periods, the maxim, although
    used frequently in other connections, <i>expedit reipublicae ut sit finis
    litium</i> is appropriate; it is indeed in the public interest that there
    should be an end to litigation.   [citations omitted]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Ontario Law Reform Commission explained the need
    for limitation periods in its <i>Report on
    Limitation of Actions </i>(Toronto: Department of the Attorney General, 1969)
    at 9-10:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Lawsuits should be brought
    within a reasonable time.  This is the
    policy behind limitation statutes.  These
    laws are designed to prevent persons from beginning actions once that
    reasonable time has passed.  Underlying
    the policy is a recognition that it is not fair that an individual should be
    subject indefinitely to the threat of being sued over a particular matter.  Nor is it in the interests of the community
    that disputes should be capable of dragging on interminably.  Furthermore, evidentiary problems are likely
    to arise as time passes.  Witnesses
    become forgetful or die: documents may be lost or destroyed.  Certainly, it is desirable that, at some
    point, there should be an end to the possibility of litigation in any
    dispute.  A statute of limitation is sometimes
    referred to as an “Act of peace”.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Apart from the protection they give to potential
    defendants, limitation statutes enable the courts to function more effectively
    by ensuring that litigation is not started so long after the event that there
    are likely to be evidential difficulties.  In addition, the commercial world is able to carry on more
    smoothly.  The limitation statutes
    encourage early settlements so that the disrupting effect of unsettled claims
    on commercial intercourse is minimized.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It has been suggested that the ultimate fifteen-year
    limitation period provided by s. 15 of the new <i>Limitations Act </i>resolves
    the problem that a claim could exist in perpetuity.  In my view, it does the opposite.  It confirms that a claim could exist in
    perpetuity should a demand for repayment (or failure to respond to such a
    demand) be the triggering event.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sections&nbsp;15 (2) and (6)(c) read as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>15
    (2) No proceeding shall be commenced in
    respect of any claim after the 15th anniversary of the day on which the act or
    omission on which the claim is based took place.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>      (6) For the purposes of this section, the day an
    act or omission on which a claim is based takes place is,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            (c)
    in the case of a default in performing a demand obligation, the day on which
    the default occurs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 15(2) creates an ultimate fifteen-year
    limitation period.  It is triggered by
    the “act or omission on which the claim is based”.  Section 15(6)(c) provides that, in the case
    of demand obligations, the day an act or omission on which a claim is based
    takes place is the date of default.  If
    default does not occur until a demand for repayment has been made and no demand
    is made, there can be no default and the limitation period cannot begin to
    run.  If, on the other hand, default is
    the failure to repay on the day that a demand promissory note is delivered, the
    limitation period begins to run on that date<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[4]</span></span></span></a> and
    the ultimate limitation period will necessarily operate.  This interpretation is consistent with
    established jurisprudence, as explained above, and with s. 5(2) of the new <i>Limitations
    Act</i>, discussed below.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, it would be contrary to common sense to
    think that a piece of legislation designed to create uniform, simplified
    limitation periods actually did the opposite by taking a well-settled area of
    commercial law and creating indefinite liability.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the act on which the appellant’s claim is based is

    presumed to have discovered her claim in February&nbsp;1997.  Section 5(2) reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5 (2)  A person with a claim shall be presumed to
    have known of the matters referred to in clause (1)(a) on the day the act or

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the act on which the appellant’s claim is based is
    the delivery of the Note in February&nbsp;1997, pursuant to s.&nbsp;5(2) of the

    presumption.  Consequently, she is
    presumed to have discovered the claim before January 1, 2004, and Rule 2 of s.
    24(5) applies.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My third reason for rejecting the appellant’s
    submission is this.  The alleged
    deficiency in the approach to limitation periods under the former legislation
    is that it failed to recognize that a person may not know of a cause of action
    at the time the limitation period commences.  Hence, the former approach could act to unfairly bar claims before potential
    plaintiffs had any knowledge of their causes of action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This concern, it seems to me, does not arise in the
    case of demand promissory notes.  The law
    is well-settled that a lender has the right to immediate repayment of such
    loans.  The face of the promissory note
    makes clear that the debtor owes money to the lender.  As there is no repayment period specified,
    the lender is entitled to require immediate repayment.  There is nothing to be discovered by the
    lender before he or she becomes aware of their claim.  They know of their claim immediately on
    receipt of the demand promissory note. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule 2 of s. 24(5) of the new <i>Limitations Act </i>provides
    that the former limitation period applies.  As explained above, the former limitation period is the six-year
    limitation period under s.&nbsp;45(1)(g) of the former <i>Limitations Act</i>.  For the
    reasons given by the motion judge, set out above, the former limitation period
    has expired and the appellant’s action is statute-barred.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The question is whether the new Act changes the

    date of default following a demand, as opposed to the date the loan is
    made.  I conclude that it does.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gillese J.A. reaches the conclusion she does because
    she does not accept that the legislature, by enacting the new Act, intended to
    change the law relating to demand notes.  She would require very clear language to make evident the intention of
    the legislature to depart from established commercial practice and disturb
    existing common law rights before adopting a construction of the new Act that
    would overturn long-established jurisprudence.  </p>

    at p. 87 of his Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>     Today there is only one principle or
    approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context
    and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the
    Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Driedger’s modern approach has been repeatedly
    cited by this Court as the preferred approach to statutory interpretation
    across a wide range of interpretive settings.  [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Looking at the new Act as whole, it marks a major
    change of approach from the former limitations regime.  It prescribes a basic limitation period of
    two years and an ultimate limitation period of fifteen years that both apply
    generally, it enumerates a number of claims subject to no limitation period,
    and it lists specific statutory limitation periods that remain unchanged.  I will describe the key parts of the new Act
    in more detail. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the new Act creates a new “basic limitation
    period” of two years that applies generally.  It begins to run on the day on which the claim was discovered as opposed
    to the day on which the cause of action arose.  This is apparent from sections 1, 4 and 5, which are set out below.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1. In this Act, … “claim” means a claim to remedy
    an injury, loss or damage that occurred as a result of an act or omission </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4.  Unless
    this Act provides otherwise, a proceeding shall not be commenced in respect of
    a claim after the second anniversary of the day on which the claim was
    discovered. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5.  (1)  A claim is discovered on the earlier of,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)    the
    day on which the person with the claim first knew,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)    that the injury, loss or damage had
    occurred,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)   that the injury, loss or damage was caused
    by or contributed to by an act or omission,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii)   that the act or omission was that of the
    person against whom the claim is made, and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iv)   that, having regard to the nature of the
    injury, loss or damage, a proceeding would be an appropriate means to seek to remedy
    it; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)    the
    day on which a reasonable person with the abilities and in the circumstances of
    the person with the claim first ought to have known of the matters referred to
    in clause (a).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)  A person
    with a claim shall be presumed to have known of the matters referred to in
    clause (1) (a) on the day the act or omission on which the claim is based took
    place, unless the contrary is proved.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the new Act provides for an “ultimate
    limitation period” that also applies generally.  The fifteen-year ultimate limitation period begins to run on the day on
    which the act or omission on which the claim is based took place.  This is set out in s. 15:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>15.  (1)  Even if the limitation period established by
    any other section of this Act in respect of a claim has not expired, no
    proceeding shall be commenced in respect of the claim after the expiry of a
    limitation period established by this section. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)  No
    proceeding shall be commenced in respect of any claim after the 15th
    anniversary of the day on which the act or omission on which the claim is based
    took place.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, ss. 16 and 17 set out a number of claims that
    are not subject to any limitation period, including proceedings for a
    declaration where no consequential relief is sought, proceedings to enforce a
    court order or an arbitration award, proceedings to obtain support under the <i>Family Law Act</i>, and undiscovered
    environmental claims.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the list of specific statutory limitation
    periods that are left unchanged is set out in a schedule to the new Act.  These limitation periods range from eight
    days to launch an application under the <i>Creditors’
    Relief Act,</i> R.S.O. 1990, c. C.45 to fifteen years to bring a proceeding for
    forfeiture under the <i>Remedies for
    Organized Crime and Other Unlawful Activities Act</i>, 2001, S.O. 2001, c. 28.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before turning to the specific provisions of the new
    Act and considering how they apply to demand loans, it is useful to make some
    observations about the <i>Limitations Act, </i>R.S.O.
    1990, c. L.15 (the “former Act”).</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>III Application of the Former Act to Demand
    Loans</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the outset, it is important to note that “[t]he law
    of limitations is wholly a creature of statute.  Limitation periods were unknown to the common law, although equity
    developed the doctrine of laches”:  Graeme Mew, <i>The Law of Limitations</i>, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed. (Markham:
    LexisNexis Butterworths, 2004) at 29. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The general rule under the former Act was that the
    limitation period began to run on the date the cause of action accrued.  Section s. 45(1)(g) of the former Act, which
    applied to demand notes, stipulated that the action “shall be commenced...
    within six years <u>after the cause of action arose.</u>” [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>July et al. v.
    Neal</i> (1986), 57 O.R. (2d) 129 (C.A.), Morden J.A. adopted the definition of
    “cause of action” as espoused by Diplock L.J. in <i>Letang v. Cooper</i>, [1965] 1 Q.B. 232 at 242-43:  “A cause of action is simply a factual
    situation the existence of which entitles one person to obtain from the court a
    remedy against another person.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The common law authorities reasoned that since a demand
    loan is fully mature and repayable when it is made, a cause of action to
    collect on a demand note accrues as soon as the note is delivered.  For example, in <i>Royal Bank v. Hogg</i>, [1930] 2 D.L.R. 488 (Ont. S.C. (A.D.)) the
    court wrote at 489: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Then, coming down to the <span class=st>note</span> on <span class=st>demand,</span> while no formal demand was made, it has been
    law certainly for nearly a century, since <i>Norton
    v. Ellam</i> (1837), 2 M. &amp; W. 461, and probably for centuries before, that
    a promissory <span class=st>note</span> on <span class=st>demand</span> is due
    as soon as it is delivered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The logic of the common law is easily appreciated.  There would be no basis upon which the courts
    could dismiss an action brought before the making of a demand.  Not only was the loan fully mature and
    repayable as soon as it was made, but the bringing of the action itself
    constituted a demand for payment.  In <i>Birks v. Trippet </i>(1666), 1 Wms. Saund.
    32, 85 E.R. 34 (K.B.), the court adopted counsel’s argument that “no actual
    request is necessary, but the bringing of the action is a sufficient
    request.”  Further, in <i>Rumball v. Ball </i>(1711), 10 Mod. Rep. 39,
    88 E.R. 616 (K.B.), the court noted: “Besides, supposing the demand necessary, the action itself, perhaps, is
    a demand.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The point I emphasize is that while the common law came
    into play in identifying the date on which the “cause of action arose,” it was
    statute law that prescribed that the limitation period began to run when a
    cause of action arose.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is also worth noting that the former Act did not
    contemplate demand loans specifically, as does the new Act in s. 15(6)(c).  Section 45(1)(g) of the former Act set out a
    six-year limitation period for actions based on “trespass to goods or land,
    simple contract or debt grounded upon any lending or contract without
    specialty, debt for arrears of rent, detinue, replevin or upon the case other
    than for slander.”  This was the
    provision that applied to demand loans.  Under it, the limitation period began to run immediately upon the
    delivery of the demand note.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, I note that all of the authorities regarding
    the commencement of the limitation period for a demand loan antedate the
    development of the discoverability principle.  It appears as though this is the first case in Ontario to consider when
    a claim based on a demand loan is discovered. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn now to a consideration of the new Act keeping in
    mind that the common law determined when one was first entitled to sue, and it
    was the former Act that stipulated that the limitation period began to run on
    that day. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>IV. Application of the New Act to Demand Loans</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The new Act establishes a new and different regime for
    limitation periods.  Section 4, which is
    set out above, provides for a basic limitation period of two years that begins
    to run, not when the cause of action arose, but on the day “on which the claim
    was discovered.”  Section 5, also set out
    above, stipulates the criteria that define the day on which a claim is
    discovered.  Section 5 refers to “injury,
    loss or damage”, but for the sake of simplicity I will, at times, speak of
    “damage” only.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My view is that the earliest a plaintiff can “discover”
    a claim based on a demand loan is the date on which default in making repayment
    following a demand occurs (provided all other conditions of the loan had been
    met) and not the date on which the demand loan is made.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some commentators have suggested that without default
    following a demand for payment, one cannot speak of the lender of a demand loan
    suffering from injury, loss or damage.  For example Brian Bucknall states, “the simple existence of a present
    debt would not, in accordance with the interpretive principles set out here, be
    construed to occasion ‘injury, loss or damage’ to the creditor until a demand
    was made and refused”:  Brian Bucknall,
    “Limitations Act, 2000 and Real Property Limitations Act:  Some Notes on Interpretative Issues” (2004)
    29 Advocates Q. 1 at 20.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That commonsense view is foreclosed by the common law
    authorities.  The rationale of the common
    law authorities dictates the conclusion that the holder of a demand note has
    suffered some sort of legally cognizable damage on the day the loan is
    made.  Otherwise, the creditor would not
    be entitled to bring an action in court. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Employing the logic of the common law authorities leads
    to the conclusion that the criteria of ss. 5(1)(a)(i), (ii) and (iii) are
    satisfied on the date the demand loan is made.  As required by subparagraph (i), legally cognizable damage has occurred
    because there is a fully mature loan that has not been repaid.  Subparagraph (ii) is satisfied because the
    act that caused the damage was the delivery of the demand note or equivalent
    act that created the demand loan.  Subparagraph (iii) is met because the claim is made against the person
    who delivered the demand note or otherwise created the demand obligation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While ss. 5(1)(a)(i), (ii) and (iii) may be satisfied
    as of the date of the loan, s.&nbsp;5(1)(a)(iv) is not.  Subparagraph (iv) requires that the claimant
    know that “having regard to the nature of the ... damage, a proceeding would be
    an appropriate means to seek to remedy it.”  Section 5(1)(a)(iv) imposes a completely new requirement.  There is nothing analogous to it in the
    former Act.  Nor are the common law
    authorities of any assistance in understanding this new requirement, as they
    address when a lender is <i>entitled</i> to
    bring a proceeding as opposed to when it is <i>appropriate</i> to do so.  A more detailed examination of
    the words of s. 5(1)(a)(iv) is necessary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My first observation is that s. 5(1)(a)(iv) sets out
    something the claimant must know, in addition to knowing the matters in ss.
    5(1)(a)(i), (ii) and (iii).  In the
    context of a demand loan, knowledge of the matters in the first three
    subparagraphs is sufficient for a creditor to appreciate that he or she has a
    cause of action against the debtor.  If
    s. 5(1)(a) were satisfied upon a creditor knowing he or she has a cause of
    action, then s. 5(1)(a)(iv) would be devoid of meaning.  This leads me to conclude that, at least in
    the context of a demand loan, the creditor must know more than that a cause of
    action has accrued. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I next observe that the “nature” of the injury, loss or
    damage is important in assessing whether the claimant should know a proceeding
    is appropriate.  The “nature” of an
    injury, loss or damage requires consideration of matters beyond the mere fact
    that such exists.  “Nature” is a general
    word.  It would seem to include the
    character as well as the extent of the injury, loss or damage.  Before the concept of discoverability was
    judicially developed, the nature and extent of damages were not relevant to the
    determination of whether a cause of action accrued.  As Major J. noted in <i>Peixeiro v. Haberman,</i> [1997] 3 S.C.R. 549 at para. 18:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It was conceded that at common law ignorance of or
    mistake as to the extent of damages does not delay time under a limitation
    period.  The authorities are clear that
    the exact extent of the loss of the plaintiff need not be known for the cause
    of action to accrue.  Once the plaintiff
    knows that some damage has occurred and has identified the tortfeasor ..., the
    cause of action has accrued.  Neither the
    extent of damage nor the type of damage need be known.  [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the determination of this case, it is neither
    necessary nor desirable to embark on an exhaustive consideration of the meaning
    of the “nature” of the injury, loss or damage.  It is sufficient to say that the nature of the damage that flows from a
    freely advanced demand loan is latent or potential until the debtor defaults in
    making repayment.  Until then, the
    creditor is in precisely the situation he or she expected to be in.  The creditor has lent money to someone and
    expects that person to keep it until asked to repay it.  If the creditor did not expect the debtor to
    repay the money when asked to, it is doubtful the loan would have been advanced
    in the first place.  It is only when the
    debtor fails to repay the money after a demand is made, that the creditor
    realizes the damage is not latent but actual.  The creditor knows from the beginning that he or she is owed money, but
    only knows after the debtor has defaulted following a demand for repayment that
    he or she has a “bad debt”.  I conclude
    that the nature of the damage occasioned by the debt, whether “latent” or
    “actual”, is pertinent to the application of s. 5(1)(a)(iv).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is necessary, in interpreting section s.
    5(1)(a)(iv), to consider what a reasonable person with the abilities and in the
    circumstances of the person with the claim ought to have known as required by
    s. 5(1)(b).  A reasonable person who has
    extended a demand loan would know from the common law that he or she was
    entitled to commence legal action without first making a demand.  That person would know that a legal
    proceeding might not be necessary to collect the debt as the making of a simple
    demand might prompt repayment.  He or she
    would also know that commencing a legal proceeding could result in unnecessary
    costs.  Finally and most importantly, the
    reasonable person would be well aware that the courts take a dim view of
    unnecessary litigation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are many illustrations of the courts’ dim view of
    unnecessary litigation.  There are the
    common law concepts of maintenance and champerty; there is the rule against
    multiple proceedings; and there are potential cost consequences for unnecessary
    steps and excessive caution.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The inappropriateness of commencing a legal action on a
    demand note without first making a demand is so apparent there are few cases
    where such action has been taken.  Nevertheless, in<span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:Garamond'> </span><i>Byles on
    Bills of Exchange</i> (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1965) at 378, Maurice Megrah
    writes: <i> </i>“If a bill or note is payable on demand,
    no demand other than action brought is necessary, apart from the question of
    costs, to enforce payment.”  For this
    proposition, <i>Macintosh v. Haydon</i> (1826), Ry. &amp; Mood. 362, 171 E.R. 1050 (K.B.), is cited as authority, where
    the court wrote at 363:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is quite true that in strict law no demand is
    necessary against an acceptor, but in practice a demand is usual, and ought to
    be made before proceedings are instituted; and it might make a material
    difference in the costs, if a solvent acceptor, against whom proceedings had
    been instituted without a demand, were promptly to apply to the Court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is worth noting that in <i>Recommendations for a New Limitations Act: Report of the Limitations
    Act Consultation Group</i> (Toronto:  Consultation Group on the Limitations Act, 1991), it was recommended
    that the plaintiff have knowledge of “the significance of the harm relative to
    the claim.”  The Consultation Group made
    the following pertinent comments about the earlier wording proposed for s.
    5(1)(a)(iv) at 24:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If the limitation period starts to run as soon as
    the plaintiff has knowledge of the harm, the cause of the harm and the identity
    of the defendant, in order to preserve their rights plaintiffs may be compelled
    to begin legal proceedings at the first moment they acquired this
    knowledge.  It would not be in the public
    interest if limitations policy inadvertently promoted unnecessary
    litigation.  Accordingly, some account
    should be taken of the significance of the harm, so the plaintiff is not
    necessarily required to commence proceedings at the first sign of damage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, it would seem to me that a reasonable person
    would not know that it was appropriate to commence a legal proceeding to
    recover a demand loan without first making a demand for repayment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have considered the reasoning that a creditor would
    know that the limitation period had begun to run upon the making of a demand
    loan, and so would regard it as appropriate to commence a legal proceeding
    before the limitation period expired.  In
    my view, this reasoning is circular.  It
    uses a presumption about when the limitation period begins in order to construe
    the statutory definition of when the limitation period begins.  Section 5(1)(a)(iv) is part of the statutory
    definition of the commencement date of the limitation period under the new
    Act.  It should be construed without
    presuming the creditor knows the limitation period began upon the making of the
    loan.  As well, I see no reason for
    making such a presumption.  The common
    law does not provide a basis for making the presumption, as the common law does
    not establish limitation periods, but only addresses when a creditor is<i> entitled</i> to commence an action.  The
    only possible source for such a presumption is the former Act, which has been
    repealed.  Under the new Act, which
    governs now, it is only when the creditor knows not only that he or she is <i>entitled</i> to bring an action but also that it is <i>appropriate</i> to do so that the
    limitation period begins to run. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the grammatical and ordinary sense of the
    words of s. 5(1) is clear.  They do not
    identify the date the demand loan was made as “the day on which the claim was
    discovered.”  Under s. 5(1) the basic
    limitation period for a claim based on a demand note commences on the date that
    the debtor defaults on a demand for immediate repayment by the creditor.  To find otherwise would be to countenance
    unnecessary litigation as appropriate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other sections of the Act provide no reason to depart

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 5(2) provides that claimants are presumed to
    discover their claims on “the day the act or omission on which the claim is
    based took place.”  It follows from the
    common law, again, that a claim on a demand note is based on the act of
    delivering the note or otherwise creating the demand obligation.  At first glance, it might seem that s. 5(2)
    would entirely negate the effect of s. 5(1) for claims based on demand
    obligations.  That is not so, because, in
    my view, evidence that no demand for repayment had been made would be
    sufficient to rebut the presumption in s. 5(2).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 15(2) provides that the fifteen-year ultimate
    limitation period also begins to run on “<span lang=EN>the day on which the act or omission on which the claim is based took place</span>.”
    Attaching the same meaning to this phrase as in s. 5(2), it would seem, at
    first, that a claim based on a demand loan would be subject to an ultimate
    limitation period of fifteen years from when it is made.  However, s. 15(6)(c), provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a name="15.(6)">15(6)  For the purposes of this section, the day an
    act or omission on which a claim is based takes place is,</a></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='"15\.\(6\)"'>(c)    in the case of a
    default in performing a demand obligation, the day on which the default occurs.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This provision is undoubtedly pivotal in understanding
    the legislature’s intent regarding limitation periods for demand loans, as it
    is the only provision of the new Act that deals with demand loans expressly. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I first consider and reject a construction that would
    identify “the day on which the default occurs” as the date on which the demand
    loan is made.  I consider this
    construction because the common law authorities may be taken to imply,
    awkwardly in my view, that a debtor is in default of performing a demand loan
    as soon as the loan is made.  I reject
    this construction because the day on which “default occurs” cannot be the same
    day that would be identified as “the day of the act or omission on which the
    claim is based” absent the section.  If
    that were so, s. 15(6)(c) would be a tautology — i.e. the day of the act on which
    the claim is based is the day of the act on which the claim is based.  Section 15(2) already provides that the
    ultimate limitation period begins to run on “the day on which the act or
    omission on which the claim is based took place.”  A special provision to say the general
    provision applies to demand obligations is not necessary.  As s. 15(6)(c) must have meaning, the day of
    default must be construed to be a day other than the day that would be
    identified as “the day of the act or omission on which the claim is based”
    absent the section. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In argument, the respondent did not offer any
    interpretation of s. 15(6)(c).  In my
    view, s. 15(6)(c) refers to the day of default in not performing the obligation
    to repay a demand loan after a demand has been made.  The words “default” and “in performing” in s.
    15(6)(c) do not aptly describe the passive state of simply being subject to a
    demand obligation in good standing.  I
    would conclude that these words identify the day on which the debtor defaults
    after being called upon to “perform” by repaying the demand obligation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Gillese J.A. points out, the result of such a
    construction is that the limitation period for a demand loan will not be
    triggered unless a demand is made.  This
    potential for indefinitely existing liability does not result from s. 5 or s.
    15(2).  Section 5 and s. 15(2), without
    s. 15(6)(c), would result in there being an ultimate limitation period of
    fifteen years from the day the demand loan is made if there were no demand for
    repayment.  It is s. 15(6)(c), and s.
    15(6)(c) alone, that produces the potential for indefinitely existing
    liability.  Section 15(6)(c) creates a
    special rule for demand obligations.  In
    my view, it reflects the express legislative intent to allow the potential for
    indefinitely existing liability for demand obligations where no demand is made.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not regard this result as disharmonious with the
    overall scheme of the new Act.  While I
    agree that the legislation was designed to create uniform and simplified
    limitation periods generally, the new Act provides for special situations in
    which claims have no limitation periods.  First, it would seem that the whole of s. 15(6) is devoted to situations
    where the limitation period could remain open indefinitely.  Sections 15(6)(a) and (b) create the
    possibility for indefinite limitation periods where there is a continuous act
    or omission and a series of acts or omissions, as the ultimate limitation
    period in such situations will never begin to run as long as the act or series
    of acts continues.  While paragraphs (a)
    and (b) concern matters that are different in concept, they do provide for
    indefinitely existing liability and the new Act deals with them in the same
    subsection as demand obligations. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, as noted above, s. 16 lists a number of
    situations in which there is no limitation period at all.  It is significant that ss. 16(1)(f) and (g)
    provide that there is no limitation period in regard to certain other types of
    debt obligations.  Therefore, the
    legislature did contemplate indefinitely continuing liability in certain
    debtor-creditor relations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
    I see no disharmony between the possibility for indefinitely existing liability
    for demand obligations and the new Act as a whole.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    do I see a departure from established commercial practice or the common
    law.  There is no interference with the
    common law that determines when a cause of action accrues.  The creditor of a demand loan may still
    commence an action without making a demand for repayment, as unlikely and
    inappropriate as that action may be.  Only the provincial statute of limitations has changed.  Commercial practice must be based on the
    statutory limitation period.  Commercial
    practice would be more affected by the majority’s conclusion, which results in
    the considerable reduction, from six years to two years, in the limitation
    period during which creditors could recover on demand loans.  I venture that a two-year limitation period
    for demand loans would cause difficulties in numerous routine commercial
    transactions.  For example, a small
    company’s operating line of credit secured by a personal demand note of the
    owner would need to be revisited every two years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    I do not regard the adoption of a limitation period for demand loans that would
    commence on the day of default following a demand to be an interference with
    the rights of the debtor.  Because the
    expiration of a limitation period does not extinguish the liability of a
    debtor, the debtor never acquires the substantive right not to repay the
    creditor.  It is simply that after the
    provincially enacted limitation period elapses, the creditor cannot proceed
    with a civil action to recover on the note.  In addition, creditors’ rights to have their money repaid should also be
    considered. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    I note that several other jurisdictions have adopted limitation periods for
    demand loans that commence only after a demand for repayment has been
    made.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1980, the United Kingdom enacted legislation that postpones the commencement of
    the limitation period for qualifying loans, which include demand loans, until
    the making of a written demand for repayment.  Section 6(3) of the <i>Limitations Act 1980</i> (U.K.), 1980,<i> </i>c. 58, provides that the limitation period
    for such loans is calculated “as if the cause of action to recover the debt had
    accrued on the date on which the demand was made.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, in Florida, for an “obligation or liability
    founded on a negotiable or nonnegotiable note payable on demand or after date
    with no specific maturity date specified in the note,” the limitation period
    does not start to run until the first written demand for payment: Fla. Stat. §
    95.031 (LexisNexis 2006). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is also significant that the Alberta <i>Limitations Act</i>, R.S.A. 2000, c.
    L-12, which is similar to the scheme in Ontario, has been interpreted in a way
    that the limitation period for a demand loan starts to run from the date of
    default following a demand for <br clear=all style='page-break-before:always' />
    repayment:  <i>Sawchuk v. Bourne</i>,
    [2004] A.J. No. 526 (Q.B.).<a href="#_ftn7"

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In sum, under the new Act in Ontario, I would conclude
    that a claim based on a demand loan cannot be discovered until a debtor
    defaults following a demand for repayment.  At that point, both the basic and the ultimate limitation period will
    begin to run. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>V. Application of the Transition Provision to Determine if the Present
    Action is Statute-Barred </h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The transition provision of the new Act has to be
    applied to determine whether the new Act or the former Act applies to the
    present appeal.  Section 24 reads as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>24.  (1)  In this section,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“effective date” means the day on which this Act
    comes into force; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“former limitation period” means the limitation
    period that applied in respect of the claim before the coming into force of
    this Act.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)  This
    section applies to claims based on acts or omissions that took place before the
    effective date and in respect of which no proceeding has been commenced before
    the effective date.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the former limitation period
    expired before the effective date, no proceeding shall be commenced in respect
    of the claim.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…</p>
  <br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always' />
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(5)  If the former
    limitation period did not expire before the effective date and if a limitation
    period under this Act would apply were the claim based on an act or omission
    that took place on or after the effective date, the following rules apply:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.    If the
    claim was not discovered before the effective date, this Act applies as if the
    act or omission had taken place on the effective date.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.    If the claim was discovered before the
    effective date, the former limitation period applies.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the demand note was given on February 10, 1997 and some interest was
    paid on October 26, 1998.  The terms of
    the note did not specify when the interest should be paid and the parties did
    not attach any significance to the payment of interest.  As Gillese J.A. does, I find it convenient to
    refer to the date of the note for the sake of simplicity and to reflect the way
    the issue was presented to the court.  Using the October 26, 1998 date as the commencement of the former
    limitation period would not change the result.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    six-year former limitation period had not expired on the effective date of the
    new Act, January 1, 2004.  The act
    referred to in s. 24(2) must mean the act of delivering the note in February
    1997 and not the act of default.  I say
    this because default is only deemed to be the act or omission for the purposes
    of s. 15.  Therefore, the claim is based
    on an act that took place before the effective date and no proceeding was
    commenced before the effective date.  The
    transition provision applies.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to the criteria for discovery stipulated in s. 5 of the new Act, the claim was
    not discovered before the effective date of the new Act.  In particular, the appellant, having regard
    to the nature of the damage could not know that a proceeding would be an appropriate
    means to seek to remedy the claim before a demand was made.  The presumption in s. 5(2) does not apply
    because the record indicates that no demand for payment was made until after
    the effective date.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first rule in s. 24(5) applies and the limitation period is calculated as if
    the act or omission had taken place on the effective date.  Applying the new Act, the basic limitation
    period would begin to run upon the respondent’s default in repaying the loan
    following the appellant’s demand made on November 10, 2004.  As such, the claim was not statute-barred
    when the appellant started proceedings in 2005.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>VI. Conclusion</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would conclude that the new Act applies, that the appellant did not discover
    her claim until the default following the demand for repayment made on November
    10, 2004, and that the appellant’s action was launched within the basic
    two-year limitation period which began on that day.  Consequently, I would conclude that the
    motion judge erred in granting summary judgment.  I would allow the appeal, set aside the
    summary judgment, and replace it with an order dismissing the respondent’s
    motion for summary judgment.  </p>
