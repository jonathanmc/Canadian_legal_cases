style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    April 10, 2006, the motion judge: (1) dismissed the appellant’s motion for
    an order discharging, setting aside or varying the contempt order of July
    29, 2004 and staying all civil contempts proceedings; (2) made a finding
    that the appellant was in contempt for the third time; and (3) sentenced
    him to a further fifteen months incarceration, consecutive to any other time
    required to be served.  The appellant appeals these orders.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is a class action in which the plaintiffs are suing the appellant in relation
    to a multi-million dollar fraud ($50,000,000 or more).  The appellant was
    noted in default and commencing in August 2003, numerous orders have been
    made for production of material and attendances for examination for discovery.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first contempt order was made on October 14, 2003 for failing to produce
    documents, answer questions on examination for discovery and attend in court.  He
    was sentenced to twelve months incarceration.  On July 29, 2004, a second
    contempt order was made for the same reasons and the appellant was sentenced
    to fifteen months incarceration followed by a third contempt order on April
    10, 2006 when he was sentenced to a further fifteen months incarceration.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Throughout
    the proceedings, the appellant has repeatedly breached his promises to the
    court and demonstrated a deliberate and flagrant disregard for court orders.  He
    was not only encouraged to purge his contempt at any time, but provided with
    opportunities to file material, to retain counsel when not represented by
    counsel, to attend for his examination for discovery and to answer questions
    under oath.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant took no step (until the present appeal) to appeal the orders to
    produce, the orders to attend for his examination for discovery, the findings
    of contempts or the sentences.  No attempts have been made to stay the orders
    except pending the hearing of this appeal.  A stay was granted but had no
    effect as the appellant was refused bail on the criminal contempt charges
    arising from the fraud.  More importantly, at all times, he could have purged
    his contempt by complying with production and submitting to his examination.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is not a case of a court sanctioning the same refusal.  In this case, each
    sentence for contempt was the result of a positive act by the appellant,
    which constituted a discrete and wilful refusal to comply with the subsequent
    orders.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant seeks leave to introduce fresh evidence, which it is alleged, contradicts
    the respondents’ contention that his responses to questions that would be
    asked on his examination for discovery are relevant for the purpose of determining
    what happened to the money invested by the class members.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accepting
    that contention at face value does not in any way render the orders for production
    and his examination moot.  This evidence could not affect the result of this
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    see no basis to interfere with the discretionary orders of contempt made
    by the motion judge.  Given the serious, wilful and deliberate nature of
    the contempt, we are not persuaded that the motion judge was in error in
    imposing the sentences that he imposed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at $10,000, all inclusive.</p>
