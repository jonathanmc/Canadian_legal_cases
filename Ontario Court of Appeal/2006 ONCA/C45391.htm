  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On
    appeal from the order of Justice Charles T. Hackland of the Superior Court of
    Justice dated May 11, 2006.</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>      On January 27, 2006, the respondent, Mr.
    Riddell, commenced an application against the Conservative Party of Canada
    (&quot;CPC&quot;) for a declaration that the parties had entered into a binding
    agreement and for the appointment of an arbitrator in relation to that
    agreement. On April 4, 2006, Mr. Riddell issued four summonses to witnesses in
    order to examine the witnesses in connection with a pending motion in the application
    and in connection with the underlying application. One of the summonses was
    issued to the appellant, Mr. Brodie.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>      </span>In
    an endorsement dated May 3, 2006, Power J. dismissed a motion by the CPC to
    quash the summonses. In his endorsement, Power J. found that the four witnesses
    may have evidence to give that would be relevant both on the pending motion and
    on the underlying application. He also held that examining counsel should not
    use the examination as an opportunity to conduct a fishing expedition with
    respect to other pending litigation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>      Subsequently, on May 11, 2006, Hackland J.
    made the order under appeal in which he directed that that the appellant attend
    for examination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>      In our view, Hackland J. made no error in
    ordering the appellant to attend for examination. As of May 11, 2006, the court
    record in this proceeding included an affidavit filed by the CPC that referred
    to information received from the appellant and appended, as an exhibit, a
    document prepared by the appellant. The record also indicated that, in April
    2006, the CPC disputed Mr. Riddell’s position that the paragraph that referred
    to information received from the appellant should be removed. In addition, the
    arguments relating to abuse of process relied on by the appellant before Hackland
    J. had already been considered and rejected by Power J. No appeal of the order
    of Power J. had been taken; nor had the appellant brought a motion on his own
    behalf seeking to quash his summons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>      We reject the appellant's contention that
    an appeal of Power J.'s order is subsumed in this appeal. On a plain reading of
    the appellant's notice of appeal, it does not include an appeal of Power J.'s
    order. During the appeal hearing, counsel for the appellant requested that, if
    necessary, we grant him leave to treat this appeal as including an appeal of
    Power J.'s order. In our view, we have no jurisdiction to do so. The appellant
    was not a party to the motion before Power J., he did not apply to be joined as
    a party for the purpose of appealing and, as already noted, he has never
    brought a motion to quash the summons issued to him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>      However,</span> even if we had jurisdiction to consider an appeal from Power J.'s order, we
    would find no error in the order that was made. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>      </span>As
    already noted, as of the date of the motion before Hackland J. (and as of the
    date of the motion before Power J.), an affidavit filed by the CPC included a
    paragraph containing information received from the appellant and appended, as
    an exhibit, a document prepared by the appellant. The record also indicated
    that, in April 2006, the CPC disputed Mr. Riddell’s position that the paragraph
    that referred to information received from the appellant should be removed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>      </span>Although
    both parties made submissions on appeal concerning matters that were not in evidence
    before either Hackland J. or Power J. that bear on the potential relevance of
    the appellant's evidence, there was no admissible evidence before us supporting
    either party's submissions. Accordingly, on the record before us, we are not
    persuaded that Power J. erred in his conclusion concerning relevance. Finally,
    as was noted by Power J., the right to conduct an examination does not include
    the right to conduct a fishing expedition relating to other litigation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In all of the circumstances, the appellant
    has not demonstrated that the examination that was ordered amounts to an abuse
    of process.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>            As
    alternative relief, the appellant asked that we stay the order of
    Hackland&nbsp;J. pending the hearing and determination of a pending motion
    brought by the CPC to stay Mr. Riddell’s application as an abuse of process. In
    our view, particularly since the CPC’s motion is scheduled to be heard together
    with Mr. Riddell’s application, the appellant has not demonstrated that such
    relief would be appropriate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>            Accordingly, the appeal is
    dismissed. Costs of the appeal and stay motion are to Mr. Riddell on a partial
    indemnity scale fixed at $7,500 inclusive of disbursements and applicable
    G.S.T. </span> </p>
