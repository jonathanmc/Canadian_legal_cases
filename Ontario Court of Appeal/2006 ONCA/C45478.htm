      Steel Car Limited and the United Steelworkers of America, Local 7135 are
      parties to a collective agreement.  Collective negotiations between the

      on behalf of its bargaining unit employees.  Since 1984, the OHIP provision
      of the collective agreement has remained essentially unchanged and now

lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      arbitrator reviewed the language of Articles&nbsp;17.06 and 17.07 and determined
      that the grievance before him raised two questions – first, is the OHP
      a premium within the meaning of the collective agreement; and second, if
      so, is it, at least effectively, the OHIP premium contemplated by the agreement?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      answering the first question, the arbitrator rejected the notion that private
      commercial law definitions should govern in determining whether the OHP
      should be considered a premium.  Rather, the issue was whether the OHP
      was a premium within the meaning of the collective agreement:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[T]he issue is not whether the
      OHP is a premium within the context of insurance law; the issue is whether
      it is a premium within the meaning of the collective agreement.  And even
      if it is appropriate to consider concepts outside the collective bargaining
      sphere in making such a determination, the realm of private commercial
      insurance is simply not the right place to turn.  O.H.I.P. emerges from
      legislation of wide application intended to confer social benefits on citizens.  A
      cursory review of both the O.H.I.P. premium (as it existed prior to the
      introduction of the [Employer Health Tax]) and other well known legislative
      schemes conferring social benefits funded, at least in part, by premiums
      clearly demonstrates that these types of premiums are readily distinguishable
      from their private commercial insurance variants.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN-US>. . . </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I am satisfied that, certainly
      to the extent that O.H.I.P. premiums are
    “premiums” within the meaning of the collective agreement, so too, and regardless
    of its “alter&#8209;ego” status as a tax, is the OHP.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With
      respect to the second question, the arbitrator asked whether the two charges
      were “reasonably and materially similar”.  He concluded that they were:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Given the sheer longevity of the
      provisions in question as evidenced by their consistent renegotiation,
      the parties, rather than continuing to append mere surplusage to their
      collective agreements, must be taken to have anticipated that the language
      might have some future application.  Similarly, had their intention been
      to limit that application to a resurrection of <i>the </i>specific O.H.I.P.
      premium … they would have negotiated language more similar to that found
      in the <i>Colleges</i> cases.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN-US>. . .</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The OHP is a discrete identifiable
      stand&#8209;alone public health care related charge collected from employees’ paycheques
      by government direction.  It is, in its chief respects, materially and
      reasonably similar to the O.H.I.P. premium payable prior to 1989.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      reaching his conclusion, the arbitrator found that the surrounding collective
      agreement language supported his interpretation of Article&nbsp;17.06.  In
      particular, the arbitrator noted that Article&nbsp;17.06 appeared under
      the heading “Medicare”, suggesting that the parties had prescribed a broad
      meaning to the term OHIP under the collective agreement.  Finally, the
      arbitrator referred to the language of Article&nbsp;17.07 as indicative
      of the parties’
    intention that the benefit negotiated on behalf of bargaining unit employees
    should not be “defeated by a change in the name of a vehicle designed to
    facilitate the delivery of public health care.”</span></p>

      arbitrator summarized his award in this fashion:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In summary, I have determined
      that the OHP is a
    “premium” within the meaning of the collective agreement and that the distinction
    between tax and premium is not material to my determination.  I have also
    determined that the OHP is not <i>the very </i>O.H.I.P. premium which existed
    prior to 1989.  I have, however, also concluded that the OHP </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman";'>–</span><span lang=EN-US> as
    a separate discrete identifiable workplace government imposed charge to fund
    public health care </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman";'>–</span><span lang=EN-US> is
    reasonably and materially similar to the former O.H.I.P. premium and is consequently
    a charge the employer is required to pay on behalf of bargaining unit employees.</span></p>

      and held that the standard of review of the arbitrator’s award was patent
      unreasonableness.  The Divisional Court observed that “the nub of the decision,
      we believe, was an interpretation of a clause in the agreement, albeit
      against a statutory backdrop.”  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span

  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span

      appellant’s principal argument – namely, that the standard of review of
      the arbitrator’s award should be correctness because the arbitrator was
      required to interpret external statutes of general application – is identical
      to the one advanced in <i>LaPointe</i>.  The analysis in <i>LaPointe</i> requires
      that the appellant’s argument in this appeal must also fail.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However,
      the appellant in this appeal, alone in the five grouped appeals, makes
      a second submission on the standard of review issue.  The appellant asserts
      that the decision of this court in <i>Lakeport</i> is wrong and should
      not be followed.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      basis for the appellant’s submission is the decisions of the Supreme Court
      of Canada in <i>Voice Construction Ltd. v. Construction &amp; General Workers’
    Union, Local&nbsp;92</i>, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 609 (“<i>Voice</i>”), and its companion
    case <i>Alberta Union of Provincial Employees v. Lethbridge Community College</i>,
    [2004] 1 S.C.R. 727, holding that the awards of arbitrators in Alberta are
    subject to review on a reasonableness standard.  The appellant contends that
    the reasoning in <i>Voice</i> is entirely applicable to the arbitral and
    judicial review regime in Ontario; accordingly, <i>Lakeport</i> is wrong
    and should not be applied in this appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      the appellant has not followed the well&#8209;established process for challenging
      settled decisions of this court.  If an appellant seeks to overturn a decision
      of this court, it must approach the chief justice and request that the
      chief justice appoint a five&#8209;judge panel to hear the appeal:  see  </span><i><span

lang=EN-US> (1996), 29 O.R. (3d) 577 at 582 (C.A.); </span><i><span lang=EN-US>David

      Regional Police Services Board</i> (2005), 76 O.R. (3d) 481 at para. 2
      (C.A.).  The appellant did not do this in this appeal.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, <i>Lakeport</i> was
      decided after <i>Voice</i>.  The panel in <i>Lakeport</i> was aware of <i>Voice</i> and
      discussed it extensively in its reasons.  The panel applied the “pragmatic
      and functional” approach to determining the proper standard of review and
      fully addressed the four well&#8209;established contextual factors that
      flesh out this approach – the presence or absence of a privative clause
      or a statutory right of appeal; the expertise of the tribunal relative
      to the expertise of the reviewing court on the questions at issue; the
      purpose of the legislation and the particular provision; and the nature
      of the question at issue (law, fact or mixed law and fact):  see <i>Dr.&nbsp;Q
      v. College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia</i>, [2003] 1
      S.C.R. 226 at para.&nbsp;26.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After
      a full and careful review of these four factors in the context of the arbitral
      and judicial review regime established by the Ontario <i>Labour Relations
      Act, 1995</i>, S.O. 1995, c.&nbsp;1, Laskin J.A., writing for a unanimous
      court, concluded at paras.&nbsp;31&#8209;34:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>On my assessment of the four contextual
      factors, patent unreasonableness remains the appropriate standard of review.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>What then of the Alberta cases?  I
      think that they are largely explained by the relatively weak privative
      clause in the Alberta statute.  Section&nbsp;142 of the Alberta <i>Labour
      Relations Code </i>states merely that an arbitrator’s decision is “binding”,
      and s.&nbsp;143(2) expressly stipulates that an arbitrator’s decision is
      open to judicial review if notice is filed with the court within 30 days
      after the date of the award.  By contrast, although the “final and binding”
    clause in s.&nbsp;48(1) of the Ontario statute is not the strongest privative
    clause imaginable, it does provide more protection than its counterpart in
    s.&nbsp;142 of the Alberta Code.  And the Ontario Act has no provisions comparable
    to s.&nbsp;143(2) of the Alberta Code expressly permitting judicial review.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I conclude that the Supreme Court’s
      decisions in <i>Voice Construction</i> and <i>Lethbridge Community College</i> do
      not alter the standard of review applicable to the arbitrator’s decision
      in this case.  The standard remains patent unreasonableness.  In my view,
      until we have a clear statement from the Supreme Court of Canada, we should
      not depart from a highly deferential standard of review of decisions of
      Ontario labour arbitrators </span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:"Times New Roman";'>–</span><span
lang=EN-US> a standard of review that harkens back to Dickson&nbsp;J.’s seminal
      decision in <i>Canadian Union of Public Employees</i>, <i>Local 963 v.
      New Brunswick Liquor Corp.</i>, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 227, 97 D.L.R. (3d) 417,
      and that has served the labour relations community in this province so
      well for over a quarter of a century.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I am comforted in this conclusion
      by the similar views of David Mullan, one of the country’s pre&#8209;eminent
      administrative law scholars.  Professor Mullan has recently written that
      it would be “premature to lament the passing of an era of deference”.  “More
      particularly”, he wrote, “I believe that that cannot be justified at least
      until such time as the Court applies a reasonableness standard of review
      to the interpretation of a collective agreement by a labour arbitrator
      in another jurisdiction and not subject to the kind of explicit review
      regime established in the Alberta <i>Labour Relations Code</i>”.  See David

      appellant submits that the Divisional Court erred in not finding that the
      arbitrator’s determination that the OHP is “reasonably and materially similar”
    to the former OHIP premium was patently unreasonable.  This argument covers
    the same ground as the appellants’
    submissions in <i>LaPointe, City of Hamilton</i> and <i>Toronto Transit Commission</i> and
    must, therefore, fail for the same reasons.</span></p>

      appellant contends, given that there are now a large number of arbitral
      awards across Ontario dealing with whether employers must reimburse their
      employees for the OHP, and given that more than three&#8209;quarters of
      those awards have accepted the employers’ position, this court should step
      in and settle the jurisprudence in favour of the employers’ interpretation.  I
      reject this submission for two reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
      there is no single, uniform collective agreement dealing with the OHP issue
      in play throughout Ontario.  This fact is exemplified by these five grouped
      appeals which involve five collective agreement provisions with very different
      wording.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
      the appellant’s submission is premised on a fundamental misconception about
      the operation of an arbitral regime protected by a standard of review of
      patent unreasonableness.  As explained by L’Heureux&#8209;Dubé&nbsp;J.
      in <i>Domtar Inc. v. Quebec (Commission d’appel en matière de lésions professionnelles)</i> (1993),
      105 D.L.R. (4th) 385 at 418 &#8209;
    19 (S.C.C.):</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>This process has led to the development
      of the patently unreasonable error test.  If Canadian administrative law
      has been able to evolve to the point of recognizing that administrative
      tribunals have the authority to err within their area of expertise, I think
      that, by the same token, a lack of unanimity is the price to pay for the
      decision&#8209;making freedom and independence given to the members of
      these tribunals.  Recognizing the existence of a conflict in decisions
      as an independent basis for judicial review would, in my opinion, constitute
      a serious undermining of those principles.  This appears to be especially
      true as the administrative tribunals, like the legislature, have the power
      to resolve such conflicts themselves.  The solution required by conflicting
      decisions among administrative tribunals thus remains a policy choice which,
      in the final analysis, should not be made by the courts.</span></p>
