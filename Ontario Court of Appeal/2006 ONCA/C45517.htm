  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment of
    Justice B. MacDougall of the Superior Court of Justice dated May 19, 2006.</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, it was open to the trial judge to conclude
    that the respondent was entitled to a fifty percent interest in the farm
    property on the basis of both a purchase money resulting trust and a common
    intention resulting trust.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent and appellant each contributed fifty
    percent of the down payment.  Although
    the appellant also increased his bank overdraft by $3,700 in order to pay the
    closing costs, we see no error in the trial judge declining to reduce the
    respondent’s interest in the property below fifty percent for that reason.  Subsequent to closing, both parties
    contributed to the improvement and maintenance of the farm property and they
    operated it as a joint venture.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s main argument is that the trial judge
    erred in not refusing the respondent the equitable relief sought because he alleges
    she came to court with unclean hands.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances of this case, the trial judge was
    entitled to take the view that the alleged improper conduct was not so
    “immediately and necessarily related to the claim” that he should exercise his
    discretion against granting the relief sought by the respondent.  The effect of the trial judge’s reasons is
    that it would be unfair, he used the word “improper”, to deny the respondent
    relief based on the conduct alleged.  We
    see no reason to interfere with this exercise of discretion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to child support, we conclude that the trial judge
    erred in two ways.  First, he erred in
    ordering a lump sum payment without evidence that would allow him to make a
    proper calculation of the amount owing in accordance with the Child Support Guidelines.  In this respect, he erred in basing the
    amount of child support on the assumption that the child would remain entitled
    to such support until age twenty-five.  He also erred by including expenses to be proportionately shared under
    s. 7 of the Guidelines, such as post-secondary expenses.  Both of these calculations were made without
    evidence about the likelihood that the child would continue in school after age
    eighteen and without allowing for contingencies.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge calculated the child support obligation
    to be $345 a month based on an imputed income of $40,000 per year to the
    appellant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, we order that there be ongoing periodic
    child support in accordance with the Guidelines in the amount of $345 a month
    commencing on January 1, 2007.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, pursuant to s. 12 of the Guidelines, we
    order that the appellant pay into court or to the Family Responsibility Office,
    as appropriate, the amount of $40,000 (the “Security Funds”) to pay and secure
    his ongoing child support obligations.  The
    Security Funds are to be paid from the appellant’s share of the farm sale
    proceeds and the appellant may deduct from the Security Funds a credit for
    payments made in excess of $345 a month from the time of trial until the
    present.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, after either the court, or the Family
    Responsibility Office, receives the Security Funds, it shall pay to the
    respondent the amount of child support provided by this order or such other amount
    of child support as may be determined by a court from time to time.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We also direct that the court, or the Family
    Responsibility Office, pay to the appellant any remaining balance of the
    Security Funds upon termination of the child support payments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant did not pursue his ground of appeal
    relating to the restraining order.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is allowed in part in accordance with these
    reasons.  Costs to the respondent are
    fixed in the amount of $14,000, inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
