lang=EN-US>On appeal from the decision of Justice S. Rogin of the Superior Court
      of Justice, dated March 25, 2006, dismissing an application to quash the
      committal order of Justice G.F. DeMarco of the Ontario Court of Justice,
      dated July 27, 2005.</span></h4>
  <h2>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals the dismissal of his application to quash his committal for trial on a charge of first-degree murder.  He maintains that the preliminary inquiry judge committed jurisdictional error by failing to consider the whole of the evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry when determining whether to commit the appellant for trial on the offence charged.  In particular, he argues that there was no evidence of the <em>mens rea</em> for first-degree murder adduced at the preliminary inquiry and that the evidence that was adduced was not reasonably capable of supporting the inference that the appellant had the requisite intent for murder.  As a result, he asserts, he should have been committed for trial on the offence of manslaughter only.  We disagree for the following reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    note at the outset that the scope for review of the committal decision of a preliminary inquiry judge is very limited.  As observed by Hill J. of the Superior Court of Justice in <em>R. v. Coke</em>, [1996] O.J. No. 808 (Gen. Div.), any reasonable interpretation or permissible inference from the evidence adduced at a preliminary inquiry, if properly admissible against the accused, must be resolved in favour of the prosecution.  However, there must be some evidence regarding the constituent elements of the offence charged.  In this case, therefore, this requirement applies to the elements of the offence charged relied upon by the Crown as establishing a planned and deliberate murder and/or a homicide committed while the victim was unlawfully confined.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant&rsquo;s challenge of his committal rests on the contention that, while there was evidence of planning and deliberation to cause harm to the victim, there was no evidence of planning and deliberation to cause the victim&rsquo;s death, that is, to cause bodily harm that the appellant knew was likely to cause the victim&rsquo;s death.  The appellant further argues that a committal for murder under s. 231(5) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> was not available here because there was no evidence to support the claim that the appellant played an active, essential or integral part in the conduct that caused the victim&rsquo;s death.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But,
    in our view, even if the parties&rsquo; original plan concerned only the intent to assault, rather than the intent to kill, the victim, there was evidence upon which a reasonable jury, properly instructed, could return a verdict of guilty on the offence charged.  The evidence led by the Crown, if accepted, would establish that: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(A portion of this paragraph has been edited for publication, pending the conclusion of the trial, in compliance with the publication ban ordered by Justice DeMarco at the preliminary inquiry.) </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our opinion, if accepted, this evidence would at least support the inference that the appellant by his conduct actively and directly facilitated the murder of the victim during the victim&rsquo;s forcible confinement in the taxicab.  This evidence could also be regarded by a properly instructed jury as supporting the Crown&rsquo;s theory that the murder was both planned and deliberate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is dismissed.  We thank both counsel for their able assistance
    to the court.</p>
