lang=EN-US>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice R.G. Hunter of the
      Ontario Court of Justice, dated March 15, 2006</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-weight:normal'>.</span></h4>
  <h2>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant pleaded guilty to one count each of possession of a firearm without
    being a holder of a licence and possession of a firearm while prohibited
    from doing so.  Notwithstanding a joint submission by Crown and defence counsel
    that a fit sentence in the circumstances was time served, being the equivalent
    of 11 months incarceration, the sentencing judge imposed a sentence comprised
    of time served, credited on a two-for-one basis, and an additional nine months
    incarceration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our opinion, the sentencing judge erred in principle in rejecting the joint
    submission.  The sentencing judge provided no analysis or explanation in
    his reasons as to why it would be contrary to the public interest or bring
    the administration of justice into disrepute if effect was given to the joint
    submission.  Indeed, he made no reference at all to this high threshold for
    declining to accept the joint submission.  Instead, in very brief reasons,
    he merely indicated that he had “some problems” with the joint submission
    given the appellant’s criminal record, the appellant’s breach of the firearm
    prohibition order and his possession of the firearm in question – an unloaded
    handgun. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the absence of further explanation, these factors, which were clearly known
    to both counsel, did not establish that the joint submission was contrary
    to the public interest or that it would bring the administration of justice
    into disrepute.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, the sentencing judge rejected the joint submission without informing
    counsel that he was disinclined to accept it and affording them an opportunity
    to make further submissions on the matter.  Although the sentencing judge
    was not required to accept the joint submission, this court has emphasized
    on numerous occasions the high threshold for rejecting a joint sentencing
    submission given the need, among other matters, to foster confidence by an
    accused, who gives up his right to a trial, that a joint sentencing submission
    obtained in return for a plea of guilty will be respected by the sentencing
    judge and, at least, not disregarded without sufficient cause.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the exchange that occurred between the appellant and the sentencing
    judge immediately following the pronouncement of sentence makes it abundantly
    clear that this important objective was frustrated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    if the sentencing judge was not prepared to accept the joint submission,
    it was incumbent on him to then consider fully the circumstances of these
    offences and this offender in determining a fit sentence.  Given the reasons
    of the sentencing judge, we cannot be satisfied that this obligation was
    met in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    leave to appeal sentence is granted, the sentence appeal is allowed, and
    the appellant’s sentence is reduced from 20 months to a total of 11 months
    incarceration, that is, time served.</p>
