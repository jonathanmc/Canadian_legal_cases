    issues arising from proceedings in the Superior Court of Justice concerning
    what has become known as the standoff at

    Caledonia.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In February of this year, a
    large group of Six Nations Aboriginal protestors occupied property in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Caledonia, known as Douglas Creek Estates, and refused to
    leave. Henco Industries Limited, a developer that then owned the property,
    obtained an injunction requiring the protestors to vacate the property and
    cease interfering with its development.  Many protestors refused to do so.  Henco then brought contempt proceedings against them.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motions judge, Marshall J.,
    found those who did not leave the property – both named and unnamed persons –
    in criminal contempt for breach of the injunction.  The Ontario Provincial Police arrested
    twenty-one persons, who, by virtue of their arrest, were convicted of contempt
    and sentenced.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

    continued.  It was accompanied by
    violence in the community: barricades were erected; a bridge was destroyed; the
    local rail line could not operate; vandalism, thefts and assaults
    occurred.  Protestors continued to occupy
    the property</span></p>

    impasse, the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario
    government decided to purchase Douglas Creek Estates from Henco and let the
    protestors remain on it.  On July 5,
    2006, the day after its purchase, the government joined Henco in asking the
    motions judge to dissolve the injunction.  On August 8, 2006, the motions judge delivered his judgment, which is
    the subject of this appeal.  It contains
    two paragraphs.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In paragraph 1, the motions
    judge ordered that the Attorney General of Ontario take carriage of the “matter
    of contempt”, that a case management meeting would be scheduled so that the
    Crown could apprise the public of its progress, and that he would remain seized
    of the matter until it was resolved.  In
    paragraph 2, he ordered that the injunction granted in favour of Henco would
    bind the Crown and that it would not be dissolved “until the criminal contempt
    has been disposed of.”  These two paragraphs
    alone are in issue on this appeal.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Attorney General of Ontario
    and the OPP submit that both paragraphs of the motions judge’s order are flawed
    and should be set aside.  The <i>amicus
    curiae</i> for the perspectives of Aboriginal Peoples, whom the Associate Chief
    Justice of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario
    appointed to assist the panel on this appeal, and the Six Nations Council
    support the appeal.  The <i>amicus curiae</i> for the perspectives of the residents of Caledonia and

    appellants’ submissions. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would maintain paragraph 1 of
    the motions judge’s order but on three conditions: (i) no person may be found
    in criminal contempt for breach of the injunction unless new contempt
    proceedings are brought and the person is given a fair opportunity to be heard;
    (ii) new contempt proceedings may be brought only for alleged breaches of the
    injunction during the period between April 21 and July 4, 2006; and (iii) the
    Attorney General and the police, in the exercise their discretion, shall decide
    whether to bring further contempt proceedings.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would maintain this paragraph
    because the referral to the Attorney General and the case management of that
    referral is a lawful exercise of the motions judge’s discretion.  I have included the first condition because
    the conduct of the contempt proceedings to date has been seriously flawed.  The motions judge’s finding of contempt
    permitted the OPP, instead of the court, to determine who was guilty of
    criminal contempt, operated prospectively instead of retrospectively and was
    made without affording basic procedural fairness to any of the twenty-one
    persons convicted.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I have included the second condition
    because, on the record before us, all possible contempts for breaches of the
    injunction that occurred before April 20 have already been dealt with; and,
    after July 4, when the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario
    government purchased the property, there have not been, and indeed cannot be,
    any breaches of the injunction.  The
    injunction prohibited interference with Henco’s development.  The mere occupation of Douglas Creek Estates
    with the consent of the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario
    government does not breach any court order.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I have included the third
    condition to ensure that the court does not seek to review the way the police
    exercises its operational discretion in enforcing the law and the Attorney
    General exercises his prosecutorial discretion.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would set aside paragraph 2
    of the motions judge’s order and in its place I would order that the injunction
    is dissolved effective July 5, 2006.  In
    my view, the motions judge erred in law and in the exercise of his discretion
    in maintaining the injunction against the wishes of both the previous owner of
    the property, Henco, and the current owner, the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario government. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I emphasize that the legal
    issues on this appeal are narrow.  The
    two broader questions that surround the standoff – the validity of the Six
    Nations land claim, which gave rise to the protest, and the wisdom of
    permitting the protestors to remain on the property while the land claim
    negotiations continue – are not before this court.  The first question will, preferably, be
    resolved at the negotiating table.  The
    decision on the second question rests with the

    residential areas; (ii) claim that the protestors have interfered with the
    quiet enjoyment of their property by revving car engines, playing loud music,
    chanting and beating drums, all in the middle of the night; (iii) claim that
    property values in the town have dropped because of the dispute, and say that
    potential buyers view Caledonia as an unsafe place to raise a family; (iv) say
    that the dispute has caused them to suffer bouts of anxiety, including an
    ongoing concern every time their children step outside; and (v) feel that the

    the court should do with the extant orders of contempt.”  Counsel for the Attorneys General of Ontario

    County, the Haldimand Law
    Association, and the Six Nations Elected Council all made submissions, as did
    the <i>amicus curiae</i> appointed by the motions judge to provide the court
    with advice on its legal options.  These
    submissions focused on whether the March 28 order continued to operate after
    the execution of the warrant of arrest on April 20, and what role the motions
    judge could assume in any future arrests and prosecutions for contempt.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Counsel for the OPP took the
    position that the court’s jurisdiction to supervise the enforcement of the
    injunction should be divided into two time periods: pre-April 20 and post-April
    20.  In the OPP’s view, its execution of
    the March 28 order on April 20 finally disposed of all contempts that occurred
    before that date.  After April 20,
    however, new contempts of the injunction took place because of the protestors’
    re-occupation of the Douglas Creek Estates.  The OPP submitted that the court could exercise its inherent
    jurisdiction to address these contempts, but would have to do so in new
    proceedings.  In its view, the March 28
    order was spent after its execution and a new order would be required to
    address post-April 20 contempt matters.</span></p>

    at one point the motions judge appeared to agree with the OPP’s position that
    the March 28 order had no continuing legal effect after its execution on April
    20.  He did not, however, view the
    court’s involvement in enforcing the injunction as ending with the execution of
    the March 28 order.  Much of the hearing,
    therefore, was devoted to submissions on the court’s jurisdiction to continue
    enforcing the injunction through new orders. While emphasizing that the motions
    judge should allow the Crown to decide whether future contempt proceedings
    would be appropriate, the other parties conceded that the court was entitled to
    exercise its inherent jurisdiction to refer the matter to the Attorney
    General.  The Haldimand Law Association
    asked the motions judge to make a new contempt order, that, while allowing the
    OPP discretion over its execution, would “sen[d] a definite signal that it’s time the [site] was cleared.”  The motions judge declined to do so.</span></p>

    not functioning in

    Caledonia and that his
    orders were not being enforced.  The motions
    judge went as far as to say, at para. 82, that he had jurisdiction to order
    that all negotiations over the Six Nations land claims be suspended “until the
    barricades are removed from Douglas Creek Estates and the rule of law restored
    to that property.”  He said, at para. 87,
    that “the government agents involved in these negotiations should, in deference
    to the court order, withdraw from these negotiations until the court orders are
    respected, and the rule of law returned and the barricades removed”.  And near the end of his reasons he repeated,
    at para. 95, that “there should be no further negotiations till the blockades
    are lifted and the occupation is ended.”  His formal order, however, contained no term suspending negotiations.</span></p>

    the motions judge’s August 8 order and asked for a stay of the order pending

    judge’s formal order did not preclude negotiations, the parties felt
    constrained from negotiating because of the statements in the motions judge’s reasons.  Thus, we said that “the parties should be
    free to continue to negotiate if they choose to do so without fear of being in
    breach of contempt of a court order.”  We
    reserved the balance of the motion and gave our reasons on August 25.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On March 9, 2006, the motions
    judge granted Henco a permanent injunction.  The injunction restrained both named and unnamed protestors from obstructing
    the roads in and around Douglas Creek Estates and from interfering with Henco’s
    construction work.  It also required the
    protestors to remove cars and take down the barricades they had erected on the
    public highways to prevent access to Douglas Creek Estates.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On July 4, 2006, Henco conveyed
    Douglas Creek Estates to the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario
    government.  The following day, July 5,
    Henco moved to dissolve the injunction.  As it had sold the property, it no longer needed the injunction. 
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario
    supported the motion for dissolution.  It
    now owned the property and did not wish to enjoin the protestors.  No other party to the litigation opposed
    Henco’s motion.  Nonetheless, the motions
    judge refused to dissolve the injunction unconditionally.  Instead, he postponed its dissolution “until
    the criminal contempt has been disposed of.”  For convenience, I set out again paragraph 2 of his order:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>THIS

    2006, we stayed paragraph 2.  We
    concluded that there was a serious question about its validity.  We expressed our concern in para. 19 of our
    reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    Province owns Douglas Creek Estates.  It
    does not claim that the protesters are on its property unlawfully.  It does not seek a court order removing them.  It is content to let them remain.  We see no reason why it should not be

    cause a nuisance or other disturbance affecting neighbouring lands or residents
    of
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    required.  But no evidence was presented

    reasons for refusing to dissolve the injunction as of July 5: as a matter of
    law, an injunction binds a subsequent purchaser until the court dissolves it;
    and as a matter of discretion, the court is entitled to continue the injunction
    until its breach is dealt with by contempt proceedings.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

    is supportable.  As a matter of law,
    maintaining the injunction unjustifiably interfered with the government’s
    property rights.  As a matter of

    of it that had already occurred but had not been dealt with by contempt

    despite the conveyance of Douglas Creek Estates to the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    Ontario government, the injunction continued
    because “if the law were otherwise – an injunction could be defeated by
    transferring ownership.”  Thus, in his
    view “the injunction here will bind the new owner with notice – as here until
    it is finally dissolved.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the motions judge’s
    reasoning confuses two categories of cases.  In the first category, a person succeeds to the title of one who had
    obtained an injunction for its benefit; in the second category, a person
    succeeds to the title of one who is subject to an injunction.  The
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario
    government is a person in the first category.  The legal principle the motions judge relied on applies to persons in

lang=EN-US>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Thus, if a defendant property
    owner is enjoined from doing things on its property, a person who purchases the
    defendant’s property with notice of the injunction may be bound by it.  The court will not allow the beneficiary of
    an injunction to be thwarted by a change in ownership.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>An example of a case in the
    second category is this court’s decision in <i>Ruthig v. Stuart Brothers
    Limited </i>(1923), 53 O.L.R. 558 (S.C. (A.D.)).  There, the plaintiff used a shallow ford to
    cross a river running through his property.  He had obtained an injunction to restrain the defendant, a milling
    company, from drowning the ford by damming the waters of the river.  The defendant, however, sold its mill and dam
    to another company.  Although the
    purchasing company bought the property with notice of the injunction, it caused
    the ford to flood.  The plaintiff moved
    to enforce the injunction against the purchaser.  The purchaser contended that it was not bound
    by the injunction because it was not a party to the original lawsuit.  The court rejected this contention.  Either the purchaser was bound by the
    injunction, or if not technically bound, was nonetheless bound to obey it or be
    guilty of contempt for obstructing the course of justice.  Middleton J. stated the applicable principle
    at 560-561:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where there is an
    action brought concerning land, the defendant is not permitted to defeat the
    plaintiff by conveying the property which is the subject of the suit.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am not at all troubled by the question as to
    whether the remedy against the offending grantee should be technically for a
    breach of the injunction or whether it should be for contempt of court – the
    distinction between these two remedies is well pointed out in the case of <i>Seaward
    v. Paterson</i>, [1897] 1 Ch. 545 – because the result is the same in either
    case.  The contempt, whether it is
    technically – a breach of the injunction, or whether it is contempt arising
    from the doing of the thing which it is known the Court has enjoined, has the
    same outcome – a writ of sequestration, as in this case.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>See also <i>MacMillan

    his role by keeping the injunction alive against the wishes of both the current

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The law is clear.  Just because Henco Ltd., and in this case, the Attorney General of

    enforcement of the injunction, this [c]ourt is entitled to continue the
    prosecution of the case for the reason that defiance of court orders transfers
    the conduct in question from a mere civil contempt to the realm of public
    depreciation of the authority of the court and tends to bring the
    administration of justice into scorn.  It
    has become a penal matter for the court to deal with, not unlike any other

    be concerned about the defiance of the injunction.  The court has a legitimate interest in seeing
    that breaches of its orders are addressed in contempt proceedings.  But whether the court may also have a discretion
    to refuse to dissolve an injunction or to dissolve it on terms, despite the
    wishes of the party for whom the injunction was originally granted, is

    misconduct that interferes with a court’s process or seriously threatens the

    <li>March 28 to April 20, which covers the period

    executed the warrant of arrest;</li>
    <li> April 21 to July 4 (the date the Crown purchased
    Douglas Creek Estates from Henco); and </li>

    outstanding for the first period, March 28 to April 20.  As directed by the motions judge, the OPP
    went to Douglas Creek Estates on April 20 and arrested all twenty-one
    protestors who refused to leave the property.  By the terms of the motions judge’s order, on arrest these protestors
    were convicted and sentenced.  The
    Attorney General and the OPP have so reported to the motions judge on at least
    four occasions.  Although in his reasons
    the motions judge does not refer to the execution of the warrant of arrest or
    the reports back to him, I am satisfied that in this first period there are no
    remaining “contempt matters” to be case managed.  </span></p>

    the third period, July 5 to August 25, the court has no valid contempt power to
    exercise because no person has breached the injunction in this period.  That is so factually, as I outline below, not
    because we have concluded that the motions judge erred in failing to dissolve
    the injunction unconditionally as of July 5.  The law is clear that an order of the court, however wrong, must be
    obeyed until it is reversed or varied.  See
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Ontario</i><i> (A.G.) v. Paul Magder Furs Ltd.</i> (1991), 6 O.R. (3d) 188 (C.A).  Thus, even though the motions judge ought to
    have dissolved the injunction on July 5, it nonetheless remained in force until
    our stay on August 25.  During the time
    the injunction remained in force, protestors were required to obey it.  Any failure to do so would amount to
    contempt.</span></p>

    protestor did breach the injunction.  The
    terms of the injunction are important.  The injunction did not prohibit protestors from merely occupying Douglas
    Creek Estates.  The injunction prohibited
    protestors from interfering with <u>Henco’s operations</u> and <u>Henco’s use</u> of the roads in and around Douglas Creek Estates.  By July 5, Henco had no operations in Douglas
    Creek Estates and was not using the surrounding roads.  The motions judge may have thought that the
    continued occupation of Douglas Creek Estates after July 5 breached the terms
    of the injunction.  If so, he was quite
    wrong.</span></p>

    the protestors to remove cars and barricades that were preventing access to
    Douglas Creek Estates.  On the record

    had been removed.  Therefore, there are
    no outstanding potential contempt matters in this third period to be case
    managed.  </span></p>

    government.  During at least part of this
    period, Henco was continuing to build its subdivision in Douglas Creek
    Estates.  Protestors who interfered with
    Henco’s development or blocked access to it would have breached the injunction,
    and so be subject to contempt proceedings.  No proceedings have been taken for any contempts that may have been
    committed during this period.  The
    Attorney General has said that he would prefer to negotiate rather than to
    prosecute.  Still, he has not clearly
    reported on whether it has carried out the motions judge’s mandate or explained

    protect the court’s authority from improper interference.  As the motions judge recognized, the rule of

    motions judge’s order – the referral to the “matter of contempt” to the
    Attorney General – is open to two interpretations.  On one interpretation, the motions judge
    intended that his finding of criminal contempt on March 28 and the warrant of
    arrest he issued that day would continue to apply to persons who occupied Douglas
    Creek Estates in breach of the injunction after April 20.  The Crown and the OPP would continue to act
    on his finding and re-execute the March 28 warrant of arrest.  On the other interpretation, the motions
    judge intended that the Attorney General should bring and conduct any new
    contempt proceedings for breaches of the injunction after April 20, which he
    would case manage and remain seized of until they were resolved.</span></p>

    clear up this ambiguity.  At the status
    hearing on July 24, all the parties agreed with the OPP’s position that the
    March 28 contempt order and the warrant of arrest were spent after their
    execution on April 20, and that new proceedings would be necessary before
    anyone else could be found in contempt.  Although at one point during the hearing the motions judge appeared to
    accept the OPP’s position, some of his comments during the day suggest
    otherwise.</span></p>

    warrant of arrest is spent.  But even if
    the warrant is not spent, for reasons I will discuss, the contempt proceedings

    a court has inherent jurisdiction to initiate and conduct contempt proceedings
    on its own motion, in cases of alleged widespread disobedience of a court order

    judge can legitimately ask the Attorney General for a report on the steps he
    has taken to do so.  A report back is
    consistent with the court’s legitimate interest in ensuring that its authority
    and its orders are respected.</span></p>

    observations of Farley J. in <i>Canada Post Corp. v. Canadian Union of Postal
    Workers (CUPW)</i>, [1991] O.J. No. 2472 (Q.L.) (Gen. Div.) that a court may
    ask the police and the Crown to report on the exercise of their discretion:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Unless I am convinced otherwise, it would seem to
    me that in any case that was referred by the court to the Attorney General
    where he decided not to proceed in his prosecutorial discretion that it would
    be incumbent upon him to advise in open court why it was felt inappropriate to
    proceed since in essence the Attorney General is acting to assist the court.  I cannot but emphasize that this falls
    squarely within the role as set out in <i>Boucher </i>[<i>v. the Queen</i> (1954), 114 C.C.C. 263 (S.C.C.)] and which I have quoted above. </p>

    1 of the motions judge’s order is the provision that he would remain seized of

    contempt proceedings, the motions judge is entitled to remain seized of the

    that paragraph 1 of the motions judge’s order represents a proper exercise of
    his discretion.  Even though it does, I
    must still consider whether it is appropriate to maintain paragraph 1 and if
    so, the time period it should cover.  Because, as I have said, the only breaches of the injunction not already
    addressed are those that may have been committed in the period from between April
    21 and July 4, paragraph 1 of the motions judge’s order can apply only to this
    time period.  This answers the second
    question.  However, the appellants submit
    that even if paragraph 1 on its face is not legally flawed and is limited to
    this time period, the process leading up to it has been so flawed that it
    should be set aside.  They contend that

    more critically – by his contempt order, the motions judge has convicted and

    offences.  But here we are not dealing
    with an ordinary criminal offence; we are dealing with criminal contempt of
    court, which forms part of the court’s inherent jurisdiction.  Is the court then entitled to question how
    the police and the Crown exercise their discretion in respect of contempt
    proceedings?  In my view, the court ought
    not to do so unless the Attorney General has exhibited bad faith or otherwise
    acted improperly.  Thus, where, as in the
    present case, the court refers the conduct of contempt proceedings to the
    Attorney General (and implicitly to the OPP) the court should respect the
    police’s and the Crown’s discretion whether to initiate contempt proceedings,
    and if so, against whom.  To do otherwise
    would undermine the very rationale for the court’s contempt power: protection
    of the court’s process and respect for its authority.</span></p>

    breach of the injunction has occurred, and if so, by whom.  And even if the injunction has been breached,
    the police and the Crown must invariably balance many competing rights and

    presiding over criminal contempt proceedings may properly ask the police and
    the Crown to report fully on how they have exercised their discretion and why,
    the judge ought to go no further.  Unless
    the judge can point to some gross impropriety or some evidence of bad faith in
    the way the police and the Crown have exercised their discretion, the judge
    should accept their report and their explanation.  The judge ought not order the police and the
    Crown to exercise their discretion differently or even to review or question
    why that discretion has been exercised in a way the judge may find
    unpalatable.  Doing so might invite an
    inappropriate or irresponsible use of the contempt power, and therefore,
    disrespect for the court and its authority.  Such an exercise of the contempt power would run counter to its

    operational discretion and the Crown’s prosecutorial discretion.  He did so, apparently, because he was
    dissatisfied with what he viewed as the police’s and the Attorney General’s
    failure to fully enforce the injunction and his contempt order.  His reasons are replete with comments
    reflecting this dissatisfaction.  Perhaps
    the most obvious example is the following passage at paras. 51-52 of his August
    8 reasons, where the motions judge directly addresses the discretion of the
    Crown and the police:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b><u>The discretion of the crown and police</u></b> – It is clear that the police and the [C]rown have wide powers of discretion in
    when, and how to act.  The police and the
    [C]rown each have important roles in maintaining the peace.  But, that discretion should not be used to
    advance a particular policy.  That is not
    a proper exercise of their discretion.  They must not use their discretion to oust the rightful jurisdiction of
    the court or to defeat the court’s orders [footnote omitted].</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The [C]rown and the police take the position, as I
    have said, that this is entirely a land claims matter.  That may or may not be the case – but it
    would be wrong to formulate a policy based on that assumption and wrongly use
    their discretion to further that policy.</p>

    of court for disobeying the injunction.  On March 28 the motions judge amended his earlier order, but maintained
    the finding of contempt, varied the sentence to a probation order and issued a
    warrant of arrest.  On April 20, the OPP
    went to Douglas Creek Estates and executed the warrant of arrest against
    twenty-one individuals.  Under the terms
    of the motions judge’s order, by virtue of the arrest, all twenty-one persons
    were guilty of criminal contempt and sentenced to probation without ever

    Attorney General conceded that the contempt proceedings and the convictions for
    contempt are fatally flawed.  This is a
    surprising concession because the terms of the motions judge’s March 28 order
    were those proposed by the Attorney General.  But it is a concession with which I agree.  Although we have no jurisdiction to overturn
    the convictions for contempt because none of the persons convicted has
    appealed, I will nonetheless address the flaws in the process.  In my view, there are three related and
    fundamental flaws.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, the motions judge found
    a class of unnamed persons guilty of criminal contempt, and then delegated to
    the OPP the power to determine who was a member of the guilty class.  That is because the warrant of arrest
    entitled the OPP to decide who was in contempt.  Persons arrested were convicted and sentenced simply by virtue of their
    arrest.  They had no opportunity to contest
    their conviction.  Persons present on the
    property may not have been in violation of the warrant, which required the
    police to arrest only those “persons present at the barricades and blocking
    access to Douglas Creek Estates.”  Yet,
    on the motions judge’s order, even a person wrongly arrested would
    automatically be guilty of criminal contempt.  Under our criminal justice system, a court, not the police, determines
    individual guilt and innocence.  The
    motions judge disregarded this basic principle.  </span></p>

    March 28 order operated prospectively.  On that day, he found persons guilty of contempt in the future.  Under the motions judge’s order, a person who
    went to Douglas Creek Estates for the first time on April 20 could be found guilty
    of criminal contempt.  Courts find people
    guilty of a criminal offence for past conduct, not for conduct that might take
    place in the future.  The motions judge
    disregarded this principle too.  </span></p>

    in a summary procedure without the trappings of a formal criminal trial.  That he was entitled to do.  Typically, a criminal contempt hearing is a summary
    proceeding.  See <i>R. v. K. (B.)</i> (1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 18 at para. 9 (S.C.C.).  What the motions judge was not entitled to do was deny those he

    the following three reasons.  First,
    paragraph 1 represents a lawful exercise of the motions judge’s
    discretion.  Second, an important point
    of principle is at stake: the right of a judge to supervise and invoke contempt
    proceedings for breaches of a court order to maintain respect for the court and
    its process.  Here, the motions judge
    believed that there were ongoing breaches of an injunction, which in his view,
    neither the Crown nor the police had adequately enforced.  He was justifiably concerned about the
    apparent unpunished defiance of the court’s order, and therefore, justified in
    referring the “matter of contempt” to the Attorney General.</span></p>

    protest at Douglas Creek Estates has unsettled the local residents.  An atmosphere of tension, even hostility, has
    permeated
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Caledonia.  In the midst of the protest, the government
    decided to purchase the property and let the occupation of it continue.  No doubt many residents object to what the
    government has done.  Probably many
    wonder why more protestors have not been found in contempt for breach of the
    injunction.  The motions judge was in the
    best position to assess whether the public’s concern about the protestors’
    apparent defiance of the court’s order should be addressed by referring the
    matter to the Attorney General and by calling on the Attorney General and the
    police to report on how they had carried out that referral.  </span></p>

    which flow from my reasons on the proceedings to date.  First, no person can be found in criminal
    contempt for a breach of the injunction during this period unless new
    proceedings are brought and the person is given a fair opportunity to be heard;
    second, any further contempt proceedings for breaches of the injunction must be
    limited to breaches during the period between April 21 and July 4, 2006; and

    reasons had the effect of interrupting the negotiations that had begun in May
    and according to the parties had already achieved some success, we were told
    that negotiations resumed after the stay hearing when we made it clear that the
    August 8 order did not preclude negotiations.  Addressing the disputed issues by negotiations has obvious advantages as
    long as all parties work reasonably and constructively towards a settlement.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[139]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At the same time, of course, I
    accept that negotiations are not a substitute for individual responsibility for
    criminal acts.  Still, the peaceful
    occupation of what is now Crown land points to reconciliation, not the force of
    the law, as the best way to achieve a lasting resolution of this dispute.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>2.         The
    Rule of Law</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[140]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Throughout his reasons the
    motions judge emphasized both the importance of the rule of law and his view
    that “the rule of law is not functioning in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Caledonia”
    and “the law has not been enforced.”  As
    we said in our reasons on the stay motion, no one can deny the importance of
    the rule of law in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  The preamble to our Constitution states that
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    is
    founded on principles that recognize the rule of law.  The Supreme Court of Canada has said that it
    is one of our underlying constitutional values.  See <i>Reference re Secession of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Quebec</i>,
    [1998] 2 S.C.R. 217; and <i>Reference re Resolution to Amend the Constitution</i>,
    [1981] 1 S.C.R. 753.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[141]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>But the rule of law has many
    dimensions, or in the words of the Supreme Court of Canada is “highly
    textured.”  See <i>Reference re
    Resolution to Amend the Constitution, supra</i>, at 805.  One dimension is certainly that focused on by
    the motions judge: the court’s exercise of its contempt power to vindicate the
    court’s authority and ultimately to uphold the rule of law.  The rule of law requires a justice system
    that can ensure orders of the court are enforced and the process of the court
    is respected.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[142]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Other dimensions of the rule of
    law, however, have a significant role in this dispute.  These other dimensions include respect for
    minority rights, reconciliation of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal interests
    through negotiations, fair procedural safeguards for those subject to criminal
    proceedings, respect for Crown and police discretion, respect for the
    separation of the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government
    and respect for Crown property rights. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[143]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It seems to me that in focusing
    on vindicating the court’s authority through the use of the contempt power, the
    motions judge did not adequately consider these other important dimensions of
    the rule of law.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[144]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I have concluded that the

    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario government
    purchased Douglas Creek Estates from Henco, and I have been critical of his
    conduct of the contempt proceedings.  I
    should also say, however, that appellate review invariably takes place with the
    benefit of time, distance and a measure of detachment not always available to a
    trial judge.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[145]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For many months the motions

    produced great hostility in the community and interfered with the daily lives
    of many residents in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Caledonia.  His task was not an easy one.  A review of the record of the many court
    appearances shows without qualification that the motions judge exhibited great
    patience throughout, gave all parties and their counsel a fair opportunity to
    make submissions on how best to proceed, and sought to balance everyone’s
    rights while maintaining respect for the orders of the court.</span></p>

    of large scale protests or demonstrations, plaintiffs now typically sue “John

    sought.  See Julia E. Lawn, “The John Doe
    Injunction in Mass Protest Cases” (1998) 56 U. T. Fac. L. Rev. 101.  Naming John Doe and Jane Doe to represent
    unidentified protestors is, however, likely unnecessary because courts can
    enforce their orders against persons who are not parties to the action.  A non-party who disobeys a court order may be
    found guilty of contempt for interfering with the administration of justice.  See <i>MacMillan Bloedel Ltd. v. Simpson</i>,
