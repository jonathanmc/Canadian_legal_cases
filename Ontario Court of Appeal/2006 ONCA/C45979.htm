style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After a fourteen&#8209;day trial, Cohen&nbsp;J. issued an
    order dated March 23,&nbsp;2006, in which she gave Ms. Beeching the right to
    move to Argentina with the child, Nicholas, at the end of the 2006 academic
    year.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Beeching appealed.  By order dated July&nbsp;11,&nbsp;2006, Siegel&nbsp;J. ordered that the
    appeal be heard on August&nbsp;26,&nbsp;2006; he also limited the grounds of
    appeal to the issue of whether the trial judge erred in refusing to admit evidence
    tendered by the appellant regarding the security of persons in Argentina.  The evidence in question was two reports
    from Amnesty International dated December 2002 and 2004 and documents from the
    U.S. State Department.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On August 24, 2006, Backhouse J. heard the appeal.  At the appeal, Mr. Beeching sought to
    introduce, as fresh evidence, documents of the same nature and kind as those
    that had been excluded by the trial judge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal judge held that the excluded documents would not
    have materially impacted on the result.  She found no error in the trial judge’s decision to exclude the impugned
    evidence at trial.  At paras.&nbsp;5 and
    6 of her reasons, the appeal judge explained:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Documentary evidence is not ordinarily
    admissible at trial because it is hearsay evidence that, in the absence of a
    witness to present the evidence, cannot be tested by cross&#8209;examination.  The documents proffered by the father and
    excluded by Justice Cohen did not qualify for admission under exceptions to the
    ordinary rule excluding documentary evidence.  There is no provision in the <i>Children’s Law Reform Act</i> to permit
    a trial judge to admit documentary or other evidence that would not ordinarily
    be admissible under the rules of evidence governing hearsay.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is most likely that the
    evidence the father seeks to have admitted would not have materially impacted
    on the result.  The focus in a mobility
    case is on the best interests of this child.  At its highest, Justice Cohen had discretion to admit the documentary
    evidence proffered by the father.  Her
    decision to exclude the evidence should not be interfered with.  I find no error in law.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By order dated August&nbsp;24,&nbsp;2006 (the “Order”), the
    appeal judge dismissed the appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While we do not doubt the sincerity of Mr.&nbsp;Beeching’s concern
    for his son’s welfare, we see no basis on which to interfere with the
    Order.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court does not have the benefit of the transcripts of the
    evidence at trial.  Nonetheless, it is
    clear from the reasons of the trial judge that evidence was given in respect of
    conditions in Salta, Argentina.  The
    trial judge properly focussed on the best interests of the child and gave
    thoughtful reasons for permitting the respondent to move, with the child, to
    Salta.  The respondent has always been
    the primary and permanent stable force in the child’s life.  Her plan for moving to Argentina was
    reasonable and appropriate; she had made arrangements in Argentina to address
    the child’s special needs.  The trial
    judge found that the move to Salta would give the child more stability and
    security than he currently receives.  Whereas the respondent has little support in Canada, she will have the
    support of her parents, sister and extended family in Argentina.  Furthermore, based on the respondent’s
    background, age and “intense preoccupation with her child”, the trial judge
    accepted the respondent’s evidence that she would not jeopardize the child’s
    security.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs to the
    respondent fixed at $1,000, inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
