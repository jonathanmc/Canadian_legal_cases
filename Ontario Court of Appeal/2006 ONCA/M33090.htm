  <h4>A motion for production on a pending appeal from convictions entered by Justice
    Jon-Jo Douglas of the Ontario Court of Justice, on May 3, 2004.</h4>
  <p class=headingtitle><span lang=FR-CA>SIMMONS
    J.A.:</span></p>
  <p class=headingtitle>I. Overview</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lawrence McNeil was convicted of various drug-related offences
    on May 3, 2004. He brings this motion in the context of an appeal from these
    convictions. The motion is framed as an <i>O’Connor</i><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a> application to obtain records in the hands of the Provincial Crown and the
    Barrie Police Service relating to criminal charges and police discipline
    proceedings against the Barrie police officer who arrested him and whose testimony
    was accepted by the trial judge. The appellant says he requires the records to
    assist him in developing material for an application to admit fresh evidence on
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The offences of which the appellant was convicted include
    possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and trafficking in
    marijuana. Although some of the offences of which the appellant was convicted
    would ordinarily be prosecuted by the Provincial Crown, in this case, all of
    the prosecutions were conducted by the respondent, the Federal Crown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The records Mr. McNeil is seeking relate to pending charges
    under the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, and the <i>Police Services Act</i><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.15,<i> </i>(collectively “the pending charges”)
    against Barrie police officer Rod Hackett, as well as to guilty plea
    proceedings under the <i>Police Services Act</i> involving P.C. Hackett and Barrie police officer Mathew Marshall. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The pending <i>Police
    Services Act</i> charges include allegations that P.C. Hackett (the “arresting
    officer”) was a cocaine user around the time of the appellant’s arrest. The
    pending <i>Criminal Code</i> charges against
    the arresting officer and the guilty plea proceedings involve allegations of
    dishonesty, which the appellant claims are linked to the arresting officer’s
    involvement with drugs. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In accordance with the directions of an appeal management
    judge, counsel for the record holders provided inventories of the documents in
    their possession. Although the respondent Federal Crown has not seen the
    records in issue, it made submissions resisting their production. At the
    hearing, counsel for the Barrie Police Service claimed a privacy interest in
    its records. In addition, counsel for both police officers made oral
    submissions<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[3]</span></a> opposing a
    production order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the hearing, the parties were uncertain of the proper
    relationship between the test in <i>R. v.
    Trotta</i><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[4]</span></a> (dealing with the Crown’s disclosure obligations on appeal) and the <i>O’Connor</i> test<i> </i>(dealing with disclosure of records involving third party privacy
    interests at trial) when dealing with a motion on an appeal for disclosure of
    records subject to a third party privacy claim. Further, the panel had concerns
    about whether an <i>O’Connor</i>-type
    procedure<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[5]</span></a> is even necessary in relation to all of the records the appellant is seeking. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issues requiring consideration are therefore the
    following:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where an appellant seeks production of documents for the
    purposes of an appeal, what is the relationship between the <i>Trotta</i> test and the <i>O’Connor</i> test;  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>do the records in issue meet the applicable relevancy
    threshold for production; and  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>iii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>is an <i>O’Connor</i>-type
    procedure required in relation to any of the records that meet the applicable
    relevancy threshold for production.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I have concluded that on a motion
    brought in the appellate context for production of records subject to a third
    party privacy interest, the first issue for determination is whether the <i>Trotta</i> relevancy threshold has been
    satisfied. It is only once it has been determined that the <i>Trotta</i> threshold has been satisfied that the question of whether a
    third party privacy interest should trump an appellant’s claim for disclosure
    should be considered. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have also concluded that, subject to verifying that they
    contain information that there is a reasonable possibility will assist in
    developing fresh evidence that would be admissible on appeal, some of the
    records in the hands of the Provincial Crown and the Barrie Police Service meet
    the <i>Trotta </i>relevancy threshold. Concerning these records, I have
    concluded that an <i>O’Connor</i>-type
    procedure is unnecessary for most of the records in the hands of the Provincial
    Crown. Finally, I have concluded that further submissions are required in
    relation to whether an <i>O’Connor</i>-type
    procedure is required for the records in the hands of the Barrie Police
    Service. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'><b>II. Background</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'><b>            i)
    The trial</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant faced six charges at trial: trafficking in marijuana, possession of
    marijuana for the purpose of trafficking, possession of cocaine for the purpose
    of trafficking, possession of cocaine, obstructing a peace officer, and
    possession of the proceeds of crime ($165).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the purposes of this motion, the trial evidence that is significant is the
    evidence relating to the appellant’s arrest. Although there is other evidence
    that the appellant claims was important to the credibility assessments at
    trial, I consider it unnecessary to review that evidence in these reasons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:
normal;'><b>a)  The evidence for the Crown</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    arresting officer was the first witness to testify at trial. He said that on
    August 15, 2003, just after 8:00 p.m., he saw the appellant, whom he knew,
    walking down the street. Shortly thereafter he observed a second male hand the
    appellant some money; the appellant then handed the second male an unknown
    object. When the arresting officer got out of his car, the second male dropped
    the unknown object on the ground and began to walk away. After picking up the
    object, which appeared to be a baggie of marijuana, the arresting officer
    arrested the appellant and told the second male to stand still. On searching
    the appellant, the arresting officer found a second baggie of marijuana, a cell
    phone and $165.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    arresting officer testified that, after handcuffing the appellant, he noticed
    the appellant chewing on little baggies containing crack cocaine. It appeared
    to him that the appellant was trying to break the baggies and swallow the
    cocaine. A struggle ensued during which the arresting officer attempted to
    prevent the appellant from swallowing the cocaine. Shortly after the struggle
    began, P.C. Marshall arrived on the scene and joined in the fracas. Eventually,
    three broken baggies containing cocaine came out of the appellant’s mouth. The
    appellant was transported to the hospital by ambulance and the second male was
    arrested.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>P.C.
    Marshall testified and essentially confirmed the arresting officer’s version of
    the events, as did officers Dorian and Scott who also arrived on the scene
    while the struggle was underway. However, P.C. Marshall’s evidence diverged
    from the arresting officer’s evidence in some respects. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Significantly,
    P.C. Marshall said that when he arrived on the scene, he observed that the
    appellant was in custody, noticed the appellant had cocaine in his mouth and
    told him to spit it out. When the appellant resisted and started chewing, he
    put his hands on the appellant’s neck and began struggling with him. P.C.
    Marshall said he “made [the arresting officer] aware of his findings” and that
    the arresting officer assisted him in attempting to subdue the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'><b>                    b)   The evidence for the defence</b>      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified and acknowledged that he is a crack cocaine user and that
    his practice is to smoke crack cocaine with marijuana. He said that on the day
    of his arrest he had purchased two baggies of marijuana and two baggies of
    crack cocaine for his personal use, and that he carried the cocaine in his
    mouth so that he could swallow it if he was stopped.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    said that, as he was walking along the street, the arresting officer got out of
    his cruiser and began talking to him. When he asked if he was under arrest, the
    arresting officer replied he was not, said he just wanted to check the
    appellant out, and asked if the appellant had anything in his pocket. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified that he told the arresting officer that he had two grams of
    marijuana in his pocket plus his cell phone and his money. According to the
    appellant, he complied with the arresting officer’s request to place those
    items on the car. The arresting officer told him he would not be arresting him
    and that he just wanted to search him for weapons and ammunition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant said he had just placed his hands on the cruiser in order to be
    searched when an acquaintance, Duane Latour, happened by and spoke to him. He
    responded to Mr. Latour and then heard the arresting officer say something to
    Mr. Latour. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to the appellant, just after the arresting officer handcuffed him in order to
    proceed with the search, another police officer grabbed him by the throat and
    told him repeatedly to “spit it out.” During the ensuing struggle the
    appellant’s throat was squeezed so that he could not breathe or talk and he
    ultimately passed out. He said that all he had in his mouth was two baggies of
    cocaine. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Latour also testified for the defence. He said there was no drug transaction
    between him and the appellant and that he came upon the appellant while the
    appellant was being arrested. He testified that the arresting officer told him
    to be on his way and that it was only after he said that he had witnessed the
    struggle that he was arrested on an outstanding warrant and on a charge of
    possession of a controlled substance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    their evidence at trial, it emerged that both the appellant and Mr. Latour have
    lengthy criminal records.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'><b>            ii)
    The findings of guilt</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On May
    3, 2004, following a two-day trial, the trial judge found the appellant guilty
    of all charges. Convictions were entered on all counts, with the exception of
    the charge for possession of crack cocaine, which was stayed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'><b>            iii)
    The application to re-open the trial</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the matter resumed for sentencing on May 18, 2004, defence counsel at trial
    (not Mr. Schiffer) requested an adjournment. Defence counsel explained that it
    had come to her attention that the arresting officer was under investigation
    for drug-related matters. She said the Barrie Police had issued a press release
    on May 11, 2004 indicating that the O.P.P. were investigating the arresting
    officer, that she would be requesting additional disclosure, and that she might
    be asking the trial judge to either re-open the case or declare a mistrial.
    Following various discussions, the matter was adjourned to June 21, 2004 “for
    sentence.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    June 21, 2004, defence counsel indicated she was asking the trial judge to
    consider re-opening the case based on the fact that the arresting officer had
    been suspended and that there were allegations that he had been purchasing
    illegal drugs while on duty. Following submissions, the trial judge adjourned
    the matter to August 16, 2004 “for continuing trial.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    August 16, 2004, the arresting officer appeared in response to a subpoena from
    defence counsel and was cross-examined. On being asked if he had been involved
    in the use of drugs, the arresting officer indicated that he wanted an
    opportunity to speak to his lawyer before giving further evidence because he
    was under criminal investigation for purchasing drugs on duty.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[6]</span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence
    counsel had also subpoenaed the arresting officer’s police records from the
    Barrie Police Service. Following discussion about whether an <i>O’Connor</i> application was required, the
    trial judge indicated the matter would be adjourned to allow that issue to be
    argued and he asked the parties to attempt to co-ordinate the date with the
    arresting officer’s lawyer bearing in mind that the appellant was in custody. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    a recess, duty counsel appeared on behalf of the appellant and advised that
    unless the other matters could be dealt with within one week or less the
    appellant wished to proceed with sentencing that day. In the result, the
    sentencing proceeded on August 16, 2004 and the appellant was sentenced to a
    total of eighteen and one half months imprisonment.</p>

    April 2005, the respondent advised the appellant’s appellate counsel that the
    arresting officer had been charged with four <i>Criminal Code</i> offences: theft under $5000, theft over $5000, public
    mischief and obstruct justice. The informations relating to these offences were
    sworn on April 19, 2005. One of the informations alleges that, between December
    2002 and May 2003, the arresting officer converted a 1998 pick-up truck owned
    by P.C. Marshall to his own use, that the arresting officer reported the
    vehicle stolen at a time when it had not been stolen and that he provided false
    information to officers investigating the theft. The second information alleges

    truck from a fellow member of the Barrie Police Service, drove it to the home
    of an associate who is a known drug dealer, crashed the vehicle, and arranged
    to have the vehicle removed from the scene and eventually sold. In addition, he
    informed his fellow officer that the vehicle had been stolen and arranged for
    that officer to make the stolen vehicle report. As the result of discrepancies
    in the story concerning the location from which the vehicle was stolen, he and

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'><b>            i)  The relationship between <i>Trotta</i> and <i>O’Connor </i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In<i> Trotta</i>, this court set out the test for
    ordering the Crown to provide disclosure on appeal of records in its possession
    in the specific context of an application to admit fresh evidence. Since the
    applicants in <i>Trotta</i> limited their
    request for disclosure to records in relation to which third party privacy
    interests had been waived, it was not strictly necessary for this court to
    consider the impact of third party privacy interests on a disclosure
    application in the appellate context. In my view, however, the <i>Trotta</i> test for disclosure on appeal
    also reflects the appropriate stage one relevancy threshold for production of
    records on appeal that are subject to third party privacy interests.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Trotta</i>, this court explained that the
    relevancy threshold governing the Crown’s disclosure obligations on appeal is
    different from the relevancy threshold that applies at trial. In particular, at
    paras. 20 to 24 of <i>Trotta</i>, Doherty
    J.A. noted that, in accordance with <i>R. v.
    Stinchcombe</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, the Crown’s obligation at trial is “to
    make timely disclosure to an accused of all relevant information in the Crown’s
    possession.” In the trial context, “[r]elevant information refers to any
    information that there is a reasonable possibility may assist the accused in
    any aspect of the exercise of the right to make full answer and defence.”
    [Citations omitted.] </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Doherty
    J.A. went on to explain that a different approach is warranted on appeal for at
    least two reasons. First, a convicted person is no longer presumed innocent.
    Second, unless he convinces the appellate court to set aside his conviction,
    the appellant has exhausted his right to make full answer and defence. Doherty
    J.A. stated that in the appellate context what is necessary is that the Crown’s
    disclosure obligation “recognize and give full value to an accused’s broad
    rights of appeal and the rationale underlying those rights.” Accordingly, he
    concluded that “[t]he Crown’s disclosure obligation on appeal must extend to
    any information in the possession of the Crown that there is a reasonable
    possibility may assist the accused in the prosecution of his or her appeal.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the
    specific context of a proposed fresh evidence application, Doherty J.A.
    indicated at para. 25 of <i>Trotta</i> that
    two conditions must be fulfilled to trigger the Crown’s disclosure obligation.
    As to the first condition, he said:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:
normal;'>To
    obtain production, the applicant must first demonstrate a connection between
    the request for production and the fresh evidence he proposes to adduce. The
    applicant must show that there is a reasonable possibility that the material
    sought could assist on the motion to adduce fresh evidence. By assist, I mean
    yield material that will be admissible as fresh evidence, or assist the
    applicant in developing or obtaining material that will be admissible as fresh
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning
    the second condition, Doherty J.A. continued:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:
normal;'>The
    applicant must next demonstrate that there is some reasonable possibility that
    the evidence to which the production request is linked may be received as fresh
    evidence on appeal. Unless the appellant can make both links, there is no
    reasonable possibility that the material sought could assist in the prosecution
    of the appeal and consequently, no reason for this court to require the Crown
    to disclose it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    already noted, in my view, the <i>Trotta</i> test reflects the appropriate stage one relevancy threshold on appeal for production
    of records that are subject to third party privacy interests. As I will
    explain, this is because <i>Trotta</i> is
    the appellate equivalent of the <i>O’Connor</i> stage one relevancy threshold.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>O’Connor</i> stage one relevancy threshold
    for production at trial of records that are subject to third privacy interests
    requires that an applicant demonstrate “likely relevance”. In the context of a
    trial, “likely relevance” refers to a reasonable possibility that the
    information requested will be logically probative to an issue at trial or the
    competence of a witness to testify. By way of comparison, in the context of an
    application to admit fresh evidence on appeal, the <i>Trotta</i> test requires “a reasonable possibility that the evidence to
    which the production request is linked may be received as fresh evidence on
    appeal.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my
    view, it is apparent from the comparison of these two tests that the <i>Trotta</i> test is the appellate equivalent
    of the <i>O’Connor</i> stage one relevancy
    threshold.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for
    stage two of the <i>O’Connor</i> test, in
    the appellate context it is necessary that the factors be modified so that they
    reflect the interest of the appellant in “obtaining information that there is a
    reasonable possibility may assist [him] in the prosecution of his or her
    appeal.” I would modify the stage two <i>O’Connor</i> factors for application in the appellate context as follows:</p>
  <p class=heading3subtitle style='text-align:justify;

    produced to the court, the court must weigh the salutary and deleterious
    effects of a production order and determine whether a non-production order
    would constitute a reasonable limit on the ability of the appellant to
    prosecute his or her appeal. In balancing the competing rights, the court
    should consider the following factors:</p>
  <p class=heading3subtitle style='text-align:justify;

    the appellant submits that evidence tending to show that the arresting officer
    had a cocaine habit around the time of the appellant’s arrest, and that the
    arresting officer was engaging in criminal (or dishonest) conduct linked to his
    drug habit (collectively “evidence of the underlying misconduct”), could be
    admissible at trial to support an inference that the arresting officer

    the respondent submits that evidence of the underlying misconduct goes only to
    the officer’s credibility. Since the arresting officer is contesting the
    pending charges, he is likely to deny any suggestions of misconduct made in
    cross-examination. In these circumstances, the collateral evidence rule
    prohibits the admission at trial of evidence of the underlying misconduct. </p>

    advances is speculative. As there is no reasonable possibility the proposed
    fresh evidence could have affected the verdict at trial, the respondent submits
    that there is no reasonable possibility that it will be admissible on appeal

    reach these conclusions for several reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    I consider that there is a reasonable possibility that evidence of drug-related
    activity on the part of the arresting officer and of related criminal (or
    dishonest) conduct could be admissible at trial to support an inference that
    the arresting officer had an ulterior motive for approaching the appellant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    indicated above, the respondent’s position that evidence of the underlying
    misconduct would not be admissible at trial rests on this court’s decision in <i>R. v. Gassyt</i>. In my view, at least in
    relation to the records relating to the investigation of pending charges for
    drug-related activity and relating to the theft of P.C. Marshall’s truck, this
    case is distinguishable from <i>Gassyt</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants in <i>Gassyt</i> were convicted
    of conspiracy to commit murder based in part on the testimony of an undercover
    officer who posed as a hit-man. Following the appellants’ convictions the
    undercover officer was charged with theft, fraud and breach of trust. This
    court dismissed an application to admit fresh evidence concerning the criminal
    investigation of the charges, holding that such evidence could only affect the
    officer’s credibility and that its admission at trial would contravene the
    collateral evidence rule. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unlike <i>Gassyt</i>, in my view, this is not a
    case where it is clear that evidence of the underlying misconduct relates
    solely to the arresting officer’s credibility. In <i>Gassyt</i>, there was no link between the criminal charges against the
    undercover officer and the charges against the appellants. In this case, the
    pending charges against the arresting officer include allegations that he had a
    cocaine habit and engaged in criminal (or dishonest) conduct directly linked to
    that habit. Because the charges against the appellant include allegations that
    the appellant was trafficking in cocaine, in my view, there is a reasonable
    possibility that evidence of the underlying misconduct would be admissible to
    support an inference that the arresting officer had an ulterior motive for
    approaching the appellant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    although the appellant’s trial evidence did not include a suggestion that the
    arresting officer approached him for an ulterior motive, in my view, it does
    not preclude that theory. On my reading of the appellant’s evidence, P.C.
    Marshall arrived just as the appellant was about to be searched. What may have
    occurred if P.C. Marshall had not arrived is an open question. In the
    circumstances, I would not exclude the possibility that evidence tending to
    show that the arresting officer had a cocaine habit and engaged in criminal (or
    dishonest) conduct directly linked to his cocaine habit could provide a basis
    for such a theory. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    it is important to note that the test at this stage is whether there is a
    reasonable possibility of admissibility of any proposed fresh evidence on appeal.
    In my view, when combined with the fact of the pending charges for drug-related
    activity and related criminal (or dishonest) conduct, the records relating to
    the investigation of the  charges I have
    identified demonstrate on their face that there is a reasonable possibility
    that they contain information that could assist in developing evidence of the
    underlying misconduct. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this regard, I recognize that the arresting officer has not been charged with
    any drug-related offences under the <i>Controlled
    Drugs and Substances Act</i>, S.C. 1996, c. 19, or the<i> Criminal Code</i>, that the drug-related allegations against him are
    made under the <i>Police Services Act</i>,
    and that, by comparison, the<i> Police
    Services Act</i> may impose a lower threshold for commencing proceedings. In my
    view however, it would amount to improper speculation if this court were to
    rely, at this point, on the nature of the charges that were laid as a proper
    foundation for assessing the extent of any evidence of the underlying
    misconduct that is available.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
    doubt, factors such as the probative value of any evidence that may be
    developed and the amount of trial time it would likely consume could affect its
    admissibility as fresh evidence on appeal. However, where there is a reasonable
    possibility that the records contain information that could assist in
    developing evidence that bears on a decisive or potentially decisive issue at
    the trial, in my view, rather than at this stage, issues such as these are
    properly considered on the fresh evidence application, when the weight of the
    proposed fresh evidence can be properly assessed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    reach the same conclusion in relation to the application of the due diligence
    criterion. Depending on the weight of any proposed fresh evidence, failure to
    meet the due diligence criterion is not a bar to admissibility: <i>R. v. Smith</i> (2001), 161 C.C.C. (3d) 1
    (Ont. C.A.). It follows that failure to meet the due diligence criterion should
    not operate as an automatic bar to a production order. Where there is a
    reasonable possibility that failure to satisfy the due diligence criterion
    would not bar the admission of any fresh evidence that is developed, failure to
    meet the due diligence criterion is an issue that should be considered on the
    fresh evidence application. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the
    facts of this case, given the nature of the evidence the appellant proposes to
    develop and the issues to which such evidence is relevant, in my view, any
    failure to meet the due diligence criterion is more properly considered on the
    fresh evidence application rather than at the disclosure stage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    therefore conclude that to the extent that the records relating to the
    investigation of the pending charges contain information about alleged
    drug-related activity on the part of the arresting officer and of criminal (or
    dishonest) conduct that may be directly linked to such drug-related activity,
    there is a reasonable possibility that the records sought could assist in
    developing admissible fresh evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    based on my review of the pending charges, I am satisfied there is a direct
    link between the pending charges relating to the theft of P.C. Marshall’s truck
    and allegations of drug-related activity. The link is the allegation that the
    arresting officer attended at the home of an associate who is a known drug dealer
    either immediately before or immediately after crashing P.C. Marshall’s
    vehicle. In my view, it is a reasonable inference that if the arresting officer
    engaged in the misconduct underlying the pending charges relating to the theft
    of P.C. Marshall’s truck, such misconduct is directly linked to his visit to
    the drug dealer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    based on the information that is available at this point, I am not satisfied
    that the records relating to the investigation of the remaining pending charges
    are sufficiently linked to alleged drug-related activity on the part of the
    arresting officer to warrant their production. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unlike
    the pending charges relating to the theft of P.C. Marshall’s truck, there is no
    information in the particulars of the <i>Police
    Services Act</i> charges or in the criminal charges that creates a direct link
    between the remaining pending charges and the allegations of drug-related
    activity. If the appellant is not successful in developing admissible fresh
    evidence about drug-related activity on the part of the arresting officer, in
    my view, it is likely that evidence of misconduct underlying the other pending
    charges would be barred by the collateral evidence rule.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I conclude that the following records meet the <i>Trotta</i> relevancy threshold for appellate disclosure: records
    relating to the investigation of the following charges against the arresting
    officer where the particular record contains information that may assist in
    developing evidence of the underlying misconduct: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>that on December 3, 2002, he borrowed a 1998 pick-up
    truck from a fellow member of the Barrie Police Service, drove it to the home
    of an associate who is a known drug dealer, crashed the vehicle, and arranged
    to have the vehicle removed from the scene and eventually sold. In addition, he
    informed his fellow officer that the vehicle had been stolen and arranged for
    that officer to make the stolen vehicle report. As the result of discrepancies
    in the story concerning the location from which the vehicle was stolen, he and
    his fellow officer subsequently pled guilty to discreditable conduct under the <i>Police Services Act</i> for falsely
    reporting the vehicle stolen from a donut shop;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>that between December 2002 and May 2003 he converted a
    1998 pick-up truck owned by P.C. Marshall to his own use, that he reported that
    vehicle stolen at a time when it had not been stolen and that he provided false
    information to officers investigating the theft;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>that in October 2002 and April 2004, he consumed
    cocaine while on duty;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>that between 2002 and 2003 he left Barrie while on duty
    in an unmarked police vehicle and attended the home of a person known to be
    involved in the drug trade;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>that on several occasions between 2002 and 2004  he received cocaine from an associate and
    delivered it to another associate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    emphasize that my conclusion that certain records relating to the investigation
    of the pending charges meet the <i>Trotta</i> relevancy threshold for appellate disclosure is limited to those portions of
    the records that contain information that may assist in developing evidence of
    the underlying misconduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on my review of the inventories prepared by the record holders, it appears to
    me that it is likely that certain records contain at least some information
    that may assist in developing evidence of the underlying misconduct, and that
    it is possible that other records contain such information. I have listed the
    records that likely contain such information in Appendix “A” and the records
    that may contain such information in Appendix “B”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    records in Appendix “A” are divided into three sections: (i) records in the
    possession of the Barrie Police Service that are not in the O.P.P. brief (the
    “B.P.S. Appendix “A” records”); (ii) records in the possession of the Barrie
    Police Service that are included in the O.P.P. brief (the “B.P.S.-O.P.P.
    Appendix “A” records”); and (iii) records that are included in the O.P.P. brief
    only (the “O.P.P. Appendix “A” records”). The B.P.S.-O.P.P. Appendix “A”
    records and the O.P.P. Appendix “A” records both form part of the Provincial
    Crown’s brief relating to pending criminal charges against the arresting
    officer. Therefore, they are in the possession of the Provincial Crown, and
    will be referred to collectively as the “Provincial Crown Appendix “A”
    records”. The records in Appendix “B” are divided into two sections: (i)
    records in the possession of the Barrie Police Service that are included in the
    O.P.P. brief (the “B.P.S.-O.P.P. Appendix “B” records”); and (ii) records that
    are included in the O.P.P. brief only (the “O.P.P. Appendix “B” records”). As
    all of the records in Appendix “B” brief form part of the Crown brief relating
    to the prosecution of the criminal charges, they are records in the possession
    or control of the Provincial Crown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If an <i>O’Connor</i>-type procedure is necessary, I
    would order production of the records listed in Appendices “A” and “B” to the
    court. For reasons that I will explain, if an <i>O’Connor</i>-type procedure is not necessary, I would: (i) order that
    the Provincial Crown Appendix “A” records and the O.P.P. Appendix “B” records
    be produced to the respondent, the Federal Crown, to assess which portions of
    specific records may assist the appellant in developing evidence of the
    underlying misconduct and to produce those portions to the appellant; and (ii)
    give further directions concerning the remaining records.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second issue in relation to which the appellant proposes to introduce fresh
    evidence on appeal is the arresting officer’s credibility. In relation to this
    issue, the appellant requests production of the records of the guilty plea
    proceedings relating to charges of discreditable conduct under the <i>Police
    Services Act</i> against the arresting
    officer and P.C. Marshall.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'><b><span>                                    </span>A) Positions

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that the arresting officer is on record as having lied about
    the location from which P.C. Marshall’s truck was stolen and as having
    conspired with P.C. Marshall to make a false report about who was in possession
    of the vehicle when it was stolen. Unlike the situation with the pending
    charges, because the arresting officer and P.C. Marshall pleaded guilty to <i>Police Services Act</i> charges, the
    presumption of innocence is not in play. Accordingly, the appellant contends
    that the fact of the arresting officer’s guilty plea would be admissible at
    trial to undermine the arresting officer’s credibility. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No one
    contested the potential relevance of these records. Rather, the respondent and
    counsel for the officers submitted that the records should not be produced
    because the appellant abandoned an application for production of records at
    trial. In particular, these parties say that since the guilty pleas occurred on
    March 7, 2003, which was well before the appellant’s trial, the appellant
    cannot meet the due diligence criterion for the introduction of fresh evidence
    on appeal. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    reasons that I have already explained, on the facts of this case, because of
    the nature of the evidence the appellant proposes to develop and the issues to
    which the evidence relates, in my view, any issue concerning whether the
    appellant can satisfy the due diligence criterion should be addressed on the
    fresh evidence application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On my
    review of the inventories prepared by the record holders, I do not see any
    records that are identified specifically as records of the guilty plea
    proceedings. If such records are included in the inventories, I conclude that
    they meet the <i>Trotta</i> relevancy
    threshold for appellate disclosure. As for records relating to the
    investigation of the charges that led to the guilty pleas, those records also
    form part of the records relating to the investigation of the theft of P.C.
    Marshall’s truck, and are already included in Appendix “A”.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>            <b>iii)  T</b><b>he necessity for an <i>O’Connor-type</i> procedure in this case</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[85]<span

    this motion was framed as an <i>O’Connor</i> application, it appears that all parties either accepted or assumed that the
    records in issue were properly the subject of an <i>O’Connor-</i>type procedure for ordering disclosure. As already noted,
    the panel had a concern about whether an <i>O’Connor-</i>type
    procedure is necessary and I will therefore address this issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I will
    begin with a general discussion of the circumstances in which an <i>O’Connor</i>-type procedure is necessary. I
    will then consider whether an <i>O’Connor</i>-type

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    requirement for an <i>O’Connor-type</i> procedure is premised on a third party having a reasonable expectation of
    privacy (a “third party privacy interest”) in information contained in the
    record in issue. That this is so, is made clear by this court’s decision in<i> R. v. Clifford</i> (2002), 163 C.C.C. (3d)
    3.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Clifford</i>, this court was faced with
    determining whether joint counselling records of a complainant and an accused
    are subject to ss. 278.1-278.91 of the <i>Criminal
    Code </i>(the “s. 278.1 regime”). The s. 278.1 regime sets out the procedure
    for obtaining production of records subject to a third party privacy interest
    where the offence involved is of a sexual nature.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The definition of
    record in s. 278.1 is central to the s. 278.1 regime. Section 278.1
    defines “record” as follows:</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;'>For the purposes of sections 278.2 to 278.9, &quot;record&quot;
    means <b><i>any form of record that contains personal information for which
    there is a reasonable expectation of privacy </i></b>and <b><i>includes,
    without limiting the generality of the foregoing, medical, psychiatric,
    therapeutic, counselling, education, employment, child welfare, adoption and
    social services records, personal journals and diaries, and records containing
    personal information the production or disclosure of which is protected by any
    other Act of Parliament or a provincial legislature</i></b>, but does not
    include records made by persons responsible for the investigation or
    prosecution of the offence. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 278.2(1)
    provides that “no record relating to a complainant or a witness shall be
    produced to an accused in any proceedings in respect of” offences of a sexual
    nature, except in accordance with the scheme set out in ss. 278.3 to 278.91.
    Those sections provide for a two-step disclosure procedure similar to that
    required on an <i>O’Connor</i> application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Clifford</i>, Rosenberg J.A. noted that the
    majority in <i>Mills</i><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[9]</span></a><i> </i>concluded that the constitutionality of
    the s. 278.1 regime is dependent on there being a reasonable expectation of
    privacy in the information contained in the record in issue. In that respect,
    he quoted the following passage from <i>Mills</i> at para. 78: </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Therefore, if a record does not contain information
    regarding which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, then it is not
    subject to the impugned provisions governing production.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the
    same conclusion must necessarily apply to <i>O’Connor</i> and <i>O’Connor-type</i> applications,
    because they reflect the common law production procedure that applies to
    records subject to third party privacy interests not covered by the s. 278.1
    regime. Accordingly, I conclude that an <i>O’Connor-type</i> procedure is only
    necessary where records “contain information regarding which there is a
    reasonable expectation of privacy”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
    may be less clear is the process for determining whether a third party privacy
    interest exists where, as here, the records in issue are not covered by the
    production procedure set out in the s. 278.1 regime. Again, <i>Clifford</i> is helpful in illustrating this
    point.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Clifford</i>, Rosenberg J.A. noted that the
    fact that a record falls within one of the categories specifically enumerated
    in s. 278.1 does not necessarily mean that the record is subject to a
    reasonable expectation of privacy. However, he concluded that, absent evidence to the
    contrary from an accused, “a trial judge is entitled to assume that a
    reasonable expectation of privacy attaches to any of the records falling within
    the enumerated categories.” His specific comments in this respect are worth
    noting (at para. 49):</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>However,
    the structure of s. 278.1 cannot be ignored. Parliament could have simply
    defined &quot;record&quot; for the purpose of the scheme as one in which there
    is a reasonable expectation of privacy. The fact that Parliament went on to
    specify certain types of records was, in my view, intended to assist the court
    in determining the scope of the provisions. It obviously wanted to avoid an <i>ad hoc</i> reappraisal in every case of the
    need to protect certain important categories of records that could be presumed
    to have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Thus, absent evidence from the
    accused to the contrary, a trial judge is entitled to assume that a reasonable
    expectation of privacy attaches to any of the records falling within the
    enumerated categories and that, accordingly, the accused must comply with the
    provisions in order to gain access to the records. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is
    apparent therefore that under the s. 278.1 regime, records in the enumerated
    categories are presumed to be subject to a reasonable expectation of privacy
    unless evidence to the contrary is led by the accused. Under the common law
    regime however, it may be an open question whether records falling within a
    particular category, e.g. employment records, should be presumed to be subject
    to a reasonable expectation of privacy or whether they must be examined

    I have decided that only some of the records that are listed in the inventories
    prepared by the record holders meet the <i>Trotta</i> relevancy threshold, it is only necessary that I consider whether an <i>O’Connor</i>-type procedure is required in
    relation to those records. The records that I have decided meet the <i>Trotta</i> relevancy threshold are: i) those
    portions of the records listed in Appendices “A” and “B” that contain
    information that there is a reasonable possibility will assist in developing
    fresh evidence that would be admissible on appeal; and ii) any records of the
    guilty plea proceedings that may exist.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    arresting officer’s claim that the records in issue should be the subject of an <i>O’Connor-</i>type procedure is based
    primarily on an assertion that, at their core, the records are employment
    records that contain information that is highly personal to him. The arresting
    officer contends that the authorities are clear that police discipline records
    are subject to a reasonable expectation of privacy, and that an <i>O’Connor</i>-type procedure is therefore
    necessary to order their disclosure. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For reasons
    that I will explain, I conclude that the Provincial Crown Appendix “A” records
    are not employment records giving rise to any presumptive reasonable
    expectation of privacy in favour of the arresting officer. Rather, I conclude
    that they are records that were created in the course of a criminal
    investigation that resulted in criminal charges being laid against the
    arresting officer. I also conclude that the fact that the appellant is a
    stranger to the proceedings to which the Provincial Crown Appendix “A” records
    relate is not a sufficient basis for requiring an <i>O’Connor-</i>type procedure. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    arresting officer suggested no other basis for a claim of privacy in the
    Provincial Crown Appendix “A” records other than that they are employment
    records. Accordingly, I would order that they be disclosed to the respondent,
    subject to any redactions that are necessary to protect potential third party
    privacy interests of parties other than the arresting officer and P.C.
    Marshall, and subject to resolution of any privilege claims. </p>

    and, taking account of these reasons, determine whether there is information in
    specific records that would assist the appellant in developing evidence of the
    underlying conduct in relation to the charges identified in para. 75. Finally,
    I would order that the respondent disclose to the appellant any portions of the
    records containing such information.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to the respondent, the records in issue in this case fall into three broad
    categories: i) materials developed in the course of a disciplinary
    investigation that resulted in pleas of guilty by the arresting officer and
    P.C. Marshall to allegations of misconduct under the <i>Police Services Act</i> on March 7, 2003; ii) materials developed in
    the course of a subsequent disciplinary investigation that resulted in charges
    being laid against the arresting officer under the <i>Police Services Act</i> following the appellant’s trial; and iii)
    materials developed during the course of a criminal investigation that resulted
    in charges being laid against the arresting officer under the <i>Criminal Code</i> following the appellant’s
    trial.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent used this analysis as part of its submissions relating to the
    application of the <i>Trotta</i> test.
    However, in my view, the distinction between records relating to a police
    officer’s conduct that are the product of a disciplinary investigation and
    those that are the product of a criminal investigation that has resulted in
    criminal charges is also important because of its potential impact on the
    question of whether an <i>O’Connor-</i>type
    procedure for disclosure is necessary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    I do not accept entirely the respondent’s conclusions concerning the nature of
    the records in issue. I note that the inventories do not identify which police
    force prepared which records under what circumstances or for what purpose(s).
    However, in my view, the logical inferences to be drawn from the information
    contained in the pending charges, from the inventories, and from the arresting
    officer’s testimony on August 16, 2004 that he was subject to a criminal
    investigation for purchasing drugs while on duty, are the following: </p>

    P.C. Marshall’s truck in 2002, they were conducting a criminal investigation.
    The fact that P.C. Marshall and the arresting officer may have acknowledged
    making false statements to investigating officers during the course of that
    investigation, that charges flowed under the<i> Police Services Act</i> as a result, and that the records arising from the
    investigation may also serve as the basis for a discipline proceeding does not
    change the character of what was otherwise a criminal investigation, or the
    fruits of that investigation. Any records of the actual proceedings under the <i>Police Services Act</i> would however,

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    discussed in para. 78, the records in Appendix “A” are divided into three
    sections, and two of those sections (the B.P.S.-O.P.P. Appendix “A” records and
    the O.P.P. Appendix “A” records) are collectively referred to as the Provincial

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[107]<span

    already noted, the Provincial Crown Appendix “A” records form part of the
    Provincial Crown’s brief relating to pending criminal charges against the
    arresting officer and therefore are in the possession of the Provincial Crown.
    The inventories indicate these records, in large measure, consist of interviews
    of third party witnesses (often other police officers), the arresting officer
    and P.C. Marshall. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    the B.P.S.-O.P.P. Appendix “A” records are also in the possession of the Barrie
    Police Service, it is logical to infer that they were created by the Barrie
    police. On my review of the inventories or synopses of these records, they
    relate to the pending charges involving the theft of P.C. Marshall’s truck.
    There are overlapping pending charges under the <i>Police Services Act</i> and under the <i>Criminal Code</i> relating to the theft of P.C. Marshall’s truck.
    However, based on the inferences I have drawn in para. 105, rather than being
    records created during the course of a disciplinary investigation, in my view,
    the B.P.S.-O.P.P. Appendix “A” records are records created during the course of
    a criminal investigation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    my review of the inventory information concerning the O.P.P. Appendix “A”
    records, these records relate to alleged drug-related activity on the part of
    the arresting officer as well as to the investigation of the pending charges
    relating to the theft of P.C. Marshall’s truck. Some of the inventory
    information concerning the O.P.P. Appendix “A” records indicates that some of
    these records are Barrie Police Service documents (for example, vol. 1 tab 14
    “Barrie Police report re counts 3-5”). However, since these records are
    included in the O.P.P. brief only, unless the inventory information concerning
    a particular document indicates to the contrary, it is logical to infer that
    the O.P.P. Appendix “A” records were created by the O.P.P. Based on the
    inferences I have drawn in para. 105, in my view, the O.P.P. Appendix “A”
    records are records created during the course of a criminal investigation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have found that all of the Provincial Crown Appendix “A” records are records
    created during the course of a criminal investigation, I conclude that they are
    not employment records carrying any form of presumptive reasonable expectation
    of privacy. In particular, while these records may contain information
    concerning the arresting officer’s conduct during the course of his employment,
    in my view, that fact is incidental to the purpose for which the records were
    created. It does not convert the records of a criminal investigation into
    employment records.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    in my view, the fact that the appellant is a stranger to the criminal
    proceedings against the arresting officer does not, of itself, require an <i>O’Connor</i>-type procedure. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Provincial Crown Appendix “A” records are records created during a criminal
    investigation that are in the hands of the Provincial Crown for the purpose of
    prosecuting pending criminal charges against the arresting officer. In my view,
    this conclusion extends to the Provincial Crown Appendix “A” records relating
    to the investigation of alleged drug-related activity on the part of the
    arresting officer. Although criminal charges were not laid directly in respect
    of any such alleged drug-related activity, it is apparent from the fact that
    such records are included in the Crown brief that they are relevant to the
    prosecution of the criminal charges. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart
    from claiming that the Provincial Crown Appendix “A” records are employment
    records, the appellant did not assert any other specific basis for requiring an <i>O’Connor</i>-type procedure in relation
    to these records. For example, the arresting officer did not say that he had a
    reasonable expectation of privacy based on the nature of the information
    contained in a particular record or the manner in which the information was
    obtained; nor did he assert misconduct on the part of the police in obtaining
    the information. Accordingly, on the facts of this case, I see no basis for
    concluding that there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in these records
    or for holding that an <i>O’Connor</i>-type
    procedure is necessary solely because the appellant is a stranger to the
    proceedings against the arresting officer. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    therefore conclude that the Provincial Crown Appendix “A” records that meet the <i>Trotta</i> relevancy threshold are not
    subject to an <i>O’Connor</i>-type procedure vis-à-vis the arresting officer or
    P.C. Marshall and should be disclosed to the appellant. </p>

    concluded may include information that could assist in developing evidence of
    the underlying misconduct in relation to the pending charges for drug-related
    activity and relating to the theft of P.C. Marshall’s truck. However, because
    of the nature of the information in the inventories about these records, I am
    unable to determine whether it is likely that they include information that

    created during the course of a police investigation or a disciplinary
    investigation. I would accordingly direct the record holders to provide that

    Based on the conclusions I reached concerning the Provincial Crown Appendix “A”
    records, I conclude that there is no claimed basis that would make these
    records subject to a reasonable expectation of privacy vis-à-vis the arresting
    officer. Accordingly, they should be produced to the respondent, the Federal

    relating to the investigation and suspension of the arresting officer and any
    records of the guilty plea proceedings that may exist, these records consist of
    interviews with third parties concerning drug-related activity on the part of

    discipline records are employment records that are subject to a reasonable
    expectation of privacy. Rather, on my review of the case law, there are
    conflicting authorities concerning whether an <i>O’Connor</i> application is necessary for the production of police

    Palmer </i>(1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 193 (S.C.C.) establishes the criteria for
    admitting fresh evidence on appeal at p. 205 as follows:</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the evidence
    should generally not be admitted if, by due diligence, it could have been
    adduced at trial provided that this general principle will not be applied as strictly
    in a criminal case as in civil cases;</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>ii) the evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears
    upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial;</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>iii) the evidence must be credible in the sense that it is
    reasonably capable of belief; and</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>iv) it must be such that if believed it could reasonably,
    when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have
    affected the result.</p>

    inventory prepared by the Barrie Police Service includes a reference to two
    Notices of Investigation that were served on the arresting officer under s.
    56(2) of the <i>Police Services Act</i>. One
    was for “DTE (driver education initiative), the second was for “other
    misconduct” and was stated to be a duplication of a document in the O.P.P.
    brief. However, there was no specific reference to such documents in the
    inventory prepared by the Provincial Crown. Section 56(2) of the <i>Police Services Act</i> is now repealed:
    S.O. 2002, C. 18, Sched. N, s. 62. It provided: “The Chief of Police may also
    make a complaint under this Part about the conduct of a police officer.”</p>
