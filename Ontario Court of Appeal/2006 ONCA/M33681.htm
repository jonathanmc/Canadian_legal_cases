    Sigesmund was charged with seven counts of professional misconduct by the
    Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario (the
    “College”).  The Discipline Committee found him guilty on all counts.  Dr.&nbsp;Sigesmund’s
    appeal to the Divisional Court was allowed in respect to four of the counts,
    but was dismissed in respect to the remaining counts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant
    to s.&nbsp;6(1)(a) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, C.&nbsp;43
    (“<i>C.J.A.</i>”) and rule&nbsp;61.03.1 of <i>The Rules of Civil Procedure</i>,
    on February&nbsp;13,&nbsp;2006 this court granted the College leave to appeal
    the order of the Divisional Court.  On February&nbsp;15,&nbsp;2006, the College
    served Dr.&nbsp;Sigesmund with a notice of appeal from the Divisional Court’s
    order.  Pursuant to rule&nbsp;61.07, on March&nbsp;2,&nbsp;2006 Dr. Sigesmund
    served the College with a notice of cross&#8209;appeal from the order of
    the Divisional Court.  For the purpose of this motion, I find it unnecessary
    to enumerate the precise grounds of appeal and cross&#8209;appeal.  It is
    sufficient to recognize the purpose of the appeal and the cross&#8209;appeal.  The
    College seeks to restore the Discipline Committee’s conviction of Dr.&nbsp;Sigesmund
    on all counts of professional misconduct.  Dr. Sigesmund seeks to set aside
    the conviction on all counts and to clear his professional name.</p>

    College has moved for an order to quash Dr. Sigesmund’s cross&#8209;appeal.  It
    contends that as the cross&#8209;appeal is from an order of the Divisional
    Court, s.&nbsp;6(1)(a) of the <i>C.J.A.</i> requires that he obtain leave
    to appeal to this court.  For the reasons that follow, I do not agree.</p>

    is helpful to set out s.&nbsp;6(1)(a) of the <i>C.J.A.</i> as well as rule&nbsp;61.07
    that applies to cross&#8209;appeals.  Section&nbsp;6(1)(a) is part of a general
    provision that governs the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal and reads
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>6(1) An appeal lies to the Court of Appeal from,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndent-subquote>(a) an order of the Divisional Court, on a question
    that is not a question of fact alone, with leave of the Court of Appeal as
    provided in the rules of court;</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule&nbsp;61.07
    states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>CROSS-APPEALS</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>61.07 (1) A respondent who,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) seeks to set aside or vary the order appealed
    from; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) will seek, if the appeal is allowed in whole
    or in part, other relief of a different disposition that the order appealed
    from,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>shall, within fifteen days after service of the
    notice of appeal, sever a notice of cross&#8209;appeal (Form 61E) on all
    parties whose interests may be affected by the cross&#8209;appeal and on
    any person entitled by statute to be heard on the appeal, stating the relief
    sought and the grounds of the cross&#8209;appeal</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1.1) A respondent may, subject to subrule (1.2),
    serve a notice of cross&#8209;appeal without obtaining leave to appeal for
    the cross&#8209;appeal if,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) there is an appeal as of right; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) leave to appeal has been granted.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1.2) The respondent shall obtain leave to appeal
    in the manner provided by subrule 61.03(8) or 61.03.1(18), as the case may
    be, if the cross&#8209;appeal is taken under,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) clause 133(b) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>;
    or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) another statute that requires leave for an
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) The notice of cross&#8209;appeal, with proof
    of service, shall be filed in the office of the Registrar with ten days after
    service.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3) Where a respondent has not delivered a notice
    of cross&#8209;appeal, no cross&#8209;appeal may be heard except with the
    leave of the court hearing the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I understand the position of the College, it submits, notwithstanding what
    in my view is the clear language of rule&nbsp;61.07(1.1), that Dr.&nbsp;Sigesmund
    is required to obtain leave to appeal because his cross&#8209;appeal is in
    respect to issues that are not the same as those that it has raised in its
    appeal.  Even though leave to appeal has been granted to the College, it
    submits that Dr.&nbsp;Sigesmund must obtain leave to appeal because he alleges
    different errors by the Divisional Court in respect to issues other than
    those that it has raised in its notice of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.&nbsp;Sigesmund’s
    position is that rule&nbsp;61.07(1.1)(b) expressly entitles him to commence
    a cross&#8209;appeal because leave to appeal has been granted to the College.  He
    submits that the College is wrong in contending that he was required to move
    for leave to appeal because he has raised in his cross&#8209;appeal a “separate
    and distinct issue” than that raised in its appeal by the College.  Based
    on the plain language of rule&nbsp;61.07, he says that he is not required
    to obtain leave to appeal because his cross&#8209;appeal relates to a different
    part of the Divisional Court’s order.  Rule&nbsp;61.07(1.2) stipulates two
    circumstances where a respondent is required to obtain leave to cross&#8209;appeal;
    a cross&#8209;appeal from part of an order not attacked in the appeal of
    the appellant is not one of them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule&nbsp;61
    regulates the procedure that applies to appeals and cross&#8209;appeals to
    an appellate court which, pursuant to rule&nbsp;1.03, means the Court of
    Appeal and the Divisional Court.  The rule also regulates the procedure where
    leave to appeal to these courts is required.  In this case, the College required
    leave to appeal pursuant to s.&nbsp;6(1)(a) of the <i>C.J.A.</i>  There are
    other provisions of the <i>C.J.A.</i> and provisions in a number of other
    statutes that require that an appellant obtain leave to appeal to the Divisional
    Court or to the Court of Appeal.  However, the overriding principle is that
    Rule&nbsp;61 is a rule of general application regulating the procedure for
    all appeals and cross&#8209;appeals to both courts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Doctrinally,
    an appeal is taken from the order or judgment of the court.  In some proceedings,
    the court’s order may resolve more than one issue, as in this appeal.  Sometimes,
    and this appeal is a prime example, success in the court below is divided.  As
    a result of Dr. Sigesmund’s appeal to the Divisional Court, some of his convictions
    were set aside, while others were sustained.  The College was the first off
    the starting line and obtained leave to appeal to restore the findings of
    guilt against Dr.&nbsp;Sigesmund that were set aside.  However, the opposite
    could have taken place, and Dr.&nbsp;Sigesmund could have been the first
    party to obtain leave to appeal.  Thus, had the circumstances been the reverse,
    there is no doubt that the College would have wanted to proceed with its
    appeal, but in these circumstances, by cross&#8209;appeal.  In my view, it
    would undoubtedly have done so in reliance on rule&nbsp;61.07(1.1)(b).  It
    would not have sought leave to appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Obviously,
    there can be a cross&#8209;appeal only if there is an appeal.  Although each
    party could commence a separate appeal in such circumstances, the provisions
    of Rule&nbsp;61 enable the parties to avoid separate proceedings by permitting
    the respondent to commence a cross&#8209;appeal.  This is a mechanism directed
    to the simplification of proceedings, avoidance of multiple proceedings,
    judicial economy and the reduction of litigation expenses for the parties.  As
    such, a cross&#8209;appeal is similar to a counterclaim and a third party
    claim.  In most cases, a party may appeal as of right.  In other cases, such
    as this appeal, the intended appellant must obtain leave to appeal.  Provided
    that there is an appeal as of right or leave to appeal has been granted,
    rule&nbsp;61.07(1.1) permits a respondent to serve a notice of cross&#8209;appeal.  The
    only exceptions are found in rule&nbsp;61.07(1.2), which requires the respondent
    to obtain leave to cross&#8209;appeal if the cross&#8209;appeal is in respect
    to costs, or leave to appeal is required by a statute other than the <i>C.J.A.</i>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary, rule&nbsp;61.07(1.1)(b) expressly states that leave to appeal is
    not required to serve a notice of cross&#8209;appeal if leave to appeal has
    been granted.  In this case, the respondent was granted leave to appeal.  Nowhere
    in Rule&nbsp;61.07<i> </i>does it state, as the College contends, that a
    respondent is required to obtain leave to appeal if the cross&#8209;appeal
    relates to a different issue or a different part of the order for which leave
    to appeal has been granted.  Logically, almost invariably a cross&#8209;appeal
    will be based on a different error in the court below than that on which
    an appeal is based.  Moreover, taken to its logical conclusion, if the College
    is correct, there could never be a cross&#8209;appeal, with or without leave,
    on any issue different from the issue raised by the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule&nbsp;61.07(1.2)
    stipulates two exceptions to the general rule that leave to cross&#8209;appeal
    is not required if one of the two conditions in rule&nbsp;61.07(1) has been
    satisfied.  Leave to cross&#8209;appeal is required if the appeal is in respect
    to costs, as required by s.&nbsp;133(b) of the <i>C.J.A.</i>, or the appeal
    is taken under a statute other than the <i>C.J.A.</i> that requires leave
    for appeal.  Significantly, rule&nbsp;61.07(1.2) does not require leave to
    cross&#8209;appeal if it relates to a different issue or a different part
    of the order for which leave to appeal has been granted.  As Dr.&nbsp;Sigesmund’s
    cross&#8209;appeal is under s.&nbsp;6(1)(a) of the <i>C.J.A.</i>, rule&nbsp;61.07(1.2)
    does not apply.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the motion to quash Dr.&nbsp;Sigesmund’s
    cross&#8209;appeal.  Given the clear language of rule&nbsp;61.07, in my view
    this motion should not have been brought.  I would award Dr.&nbsp;Sigesmund
    costs of the motion in the amount of $5,000, plus disbursements and GST.</p>
