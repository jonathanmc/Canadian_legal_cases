    the direction of the Chief Justice under s. 680 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    this is a review of the order of the Superior Court of Justice granting bail
    to the respondent pending his trial for first-degree murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent is charged with the first-degree murder of his estranged spouse,
    Lois Mordue, on August 8, 2005 in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Woodstock,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  She was his second wife.  The respondent and Lois Mordue both had
    adult children from earlier marriages.  In 2004 the victim left the respondent.  In
    the summer of 2005 she began a romantic relationship with another man.  During
    the last two weeks of July 2005, the respondent contacted and attempted to
    contact the victim repeatedly by telephone and by leaving a note on her car
    asking for another chance.  On July 30, he telephoned her and told her he
    knew she had been with another man on the previous Saturday night, knew that
    the man drove a white car and that he was at her house at that moment.  The
    victim and her friend complained to the police who warned the respondent
    to leave them alone.  The victim confided to friends that she was considering
    divorcing the respondent and that she feared for her safety and that of the
    man she was seeing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    August 8, the respondent advised his employer he was not well.  At 10:30
    a.m. he telephoned the victim at work and told her a tire on her car in the
    parking lot was flat and asked her to come out and open the trunk so he could
    change it for her.  She refused to do so, believing that the respondent was
    stalking her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the afternoon the respondent bought some beer and started to drink it.  The
    victim returned home from work at about 5:00 p.m. and was murdered sometime
    between then and about 7:00 p.m.  She was stabbed numerous times, suffered
    a number of defensive cuts, her throat was slashed and her hand was almost
    severed.  The floor and her clothing were soaked in blood and there was blood
    splattered across the floor.  The phone line to her home had been cut.  A
    photograph of her son, who had provided her with a place to stay when she
    left the respondent, was slashed.  The respondent’s fingerprints in blood
    were found at the scene.  A beer bottle of the type the defendant had purchased
    and was drinking was found on the scene.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Between
    6:30 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. coworkers of the respondent saw him driving his pickup
    truck near the local railway line.  He looked straight ahead and did not
    wave to them as he usually did.  At 8:20 p.m., a railway conductor saw what
    he described as a “despondent man” near the railway tracks.  He called the
    police who, when they arrived at about 8:40 p.m., observed the respondent
    attempt to jump in front of a train.  They apprehended him and observed that
    he had dried blood on both of his hands, his shirt and pants and a strong
    odour of alcohol on his breath.  He had long self-administered cuts on both
    wrists.  The police recovered a knife that subsequently was found to have
    both his and the victim’s DNA on it.  There was blood in his truck that had
    both his and the victim’s DNA.  The blood on his clothes also had his own
    and the victim’s DNA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    police, upon doing a name check, discovered the victim’s complaint to the
    police made the previous week.  They went to her residence and discovered
    her lying dead in a pool of blood on the kitchen floor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the respondent was arrested he asked, “Who found her?”  When told it was
    the police, he inquired, “How could they find her?  She was in the house.”  He
    later denied he had been to the house.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    police found two handwritten notes at the murder scene, ostensibly to two
    of the victim’s children from a previous marriage.  At the preliminary hearing,
    a CFS expert identified the respondent as the author of the notes.  However,
    even without this further evidence, the contents of the notes strongly suggested
    that the respondent wrote them. In the note to the victim’s daughter, the
    respondent asked for forgiveness and told her he could not stand to see the
    victim with another man.  In the note to the victim’s son, he blamed the
    son for having purchased a home that allowed the victim to move and live
    separate and apart from the respondent.  The police found a further note
    at the respondent’s home to his three daughters.  The respondent apologized
    to his daughters and told them he could not live without the victim and could
    not allow her to be with another man.  </p>

    for impaired driving in the late 1980s.</p>

    522 of the Code provides that only a judge presiding in a superior court
    of criminal jurisdiction may order the release of an accused charged with
    murder.  Section 522(2) places the onus on the accused to show cause why
    his detention in custody is not justified within the meaning of s. 515(10).  Section
    515(10) provides:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>For the purposes of this section, the detention of an accused in custody
      is justified only on one or more of the following grounds:</span></p>

lang=EN-US>(<i>b</i>) where the detention is necessary for the protection or

  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'><span

      to maintain confidence in the administration of justice, having regard

      case, the gravity of the nature of the offence, the circumstances surrounding
      its commission and the potential for a lengthy term of imprisonment.</span></p>

    (a) of s. 515(10) is referred to as the primary ground for the detention
    of an accused.  The purpose of the primary ground is to ensure that the accused
    will attend in court to have the charges dealt with according to the law.  Paragraph
    (b) is called the secondary ground.  The secondary ground is primarily concerned
    with whether the accused will commit further offences while on bail awaiting
    trial.  Paragraph (c) is the tertiary ground.  The tertiary ground, which
    is the only ground at issue in this case, allows the detention of an accused
    in order to maintain the public’s confidence in the administration of justice.  It
    may be noted that the word “public” does not appear in the English version
    of s. 515(10)(c).  The French version, which refers to “la confiance du public
    envers l’administration de la justice”, and the Supreme Court’s interpretation
    of the paragraph make it clear that it is concerned with the public’s confidence.  </p>

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    found the opening phrase of s. 515(10)(c) – “on any other just cause being
    shown” – to be unconstitutional because it confers an open ended discretion
    to refuse release.  The court found the rest of s. 515(10)(c) to be constitutional.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Decision

    respondent’s bail hearing was conducted by a justice of the Superior Court
    in accordance with s. 522.  The bail judge released the respondent on a recognizance
    in the amount of $125,000 with his three daughters named as sureties.  Conditions
    imposed included that he reside with one daughter and her husband and that
    he be supervised at all times by his sureties. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown does not take issue with the bail judge’s finding that detention was
    not necessary to ensure the respondent’s attendance in court under s. 515(10)(a)
    nor for the protection or safety of the public under s. 515(10)(b).  The
    Crown submits, however, that detention was required under s. 515(10)(c) in
    order to maintain confidence in the administration of justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    bail judge found the tertiary ground was not satisfied because concern about
    his release could be met through appropriate conditions, and denying the
    accused bail would be tantamount to ruling that no person would be entitled
    to bail if charged with first degree murder and the Crown has a strong case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the bail judge considered the wrong question and took an unduly
    limited approach to the issue of public confidence.  Specifically, he addressed
    bail principles at large rather than focusing on the individual case before
    him, he equated public concern about safety with public confidence in the
    administration of justice, and placed insufficient weight on the four statutory
    factors that must be considered under s. 515(10)(c).</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    bail judge seemed to consider that the issue before him was whether a person
    charged with first-degree murder and facing a strong Crown case could be
    released on bail.  At para. 12 of his reasons, he stated, “In my view, the
    focus of my inquiry is whether a person charged with first degree murder,
    if the crown has a strong case, is entitled to be released on bail.”  At
    para. 15 he stated, “In these circumstances, to deny the accused bail would
    be tantamount to ruling that no person would be entitled to bail if he is
    charged with first degree murder and there is a strong case to be brought
    by the crown.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, this general question was not before the bail judge.  The proper
    focus of his inquiry was whether bail was to be granted or refused in the
    circumstances of the individual case before him. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    seems the general question posed and considered by the bail judge distracted
    him from focusing on and giving sufficient consideration to the four statutory
    factors.  As I explain at greater length below, the question of whether the
    accused’s release will undermine the public’s confidence in the administration
    of justice largely hinges on the application of the four factors stipulated
    by s. 515(10)(c).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    discussing the application of the four statutory factors to the circumstances
    of this case, I turn to an examination of the bail judge’s approach to the
    notion of public confidence in the administration of justice.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Equating Public Concern with Public Confidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    bail judge considered the level of public concern about safety.  He found
    that that public concern was adequately addressed by the quality of the respondent’s
    sureties and the bail conditions imposed.  He said at para. 12, “I do not
    find in these circumstances the same level of public concern that was evidenced
    in the <i>Hall</i> decision.  While the family of the deceased has understandable
    concerns with respect to his release, I believe that they can be met through
    conditions.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
    as <i>Hall</i> makes apparent, public concern about safety may be a relevant
    consideration in analysing the tertiary ground.  In <i>Hall</i>, there was
    a general sense of fear that there was a killer at large, and people, including
    the victim’s family, were very fearful.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Public
    fear and concern about safety, while relevant, are not the exclusive considerations
    in assessing the public’s confidence in the administration of justice.  The
    effect of the accused’s release on confidence in the administration of justice
    must be considered more broadly.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Limiting
    the analysis of confidence in the administration of justice to the public’s
    safety concerns results in the tertiary ground amounting to little more than
    a recapitulation of the secondary ground.  However, the tertiary ground provides
    a separate and independent basis to refuse bail to an accused, as McLachlin
    C.J.C. made clear in <i>Hall</i>.  At para. 30, she said, “Bail denial to
    maintain confidence in the administration of justice is not a mere ‘catch-all’
    for cases where the first two grounds have failed.  It represents a separate
    and distinct basis for bail denial not covered by the other two categories.”  This
    is further apparent in the language of s. 515(10)(c) that provides that the
    detention of an accused is justified “on one or more” of the primary, secondary
    and tertiary grounds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the bail judge placed decisive weight on the quality of the respondent’s
    bail arrangements.  By doing so, he erred by not considering whether the
    tertiary ground established a separate and distinct basis for denying bail.  Having
    quite appropriately considered the level of public concern about safety in
    this case, the bail judge erred by not going on to consider the effect the
    release of the respondent would have more broadly on the public confidence
    in the administration of justice.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;

    the individual case turns on the tertiary ground, as here, the question is
    whether the accused’s presence in the community will undermine the public’s
    confidence in the administration of justice.  The question, while easily
    stated, is not easily answered. A court, given the tools and evidence available
    to it, cannot directly discern what the public is thinking.  As McLachlin
    C.J.C. explained in <i>Hall</i>, the question comes down whether a reasonable
    member of the community is satisfied that the denial of bail is necessary
    to maintain the public’s confidence in the administration of justice.  At
    para. 41 she said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>At the end of
    the day, the judge can only deny bail if satisfied that in view of these
    factors and related circumstances, a reasonable member of the community would

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The principle

    of society”…, or persons informed about the philosophy of the legislative
    provisions, <i>Charter</i> values and the actual circumstances of the case…,
    to believe that detention is necessary to maintain public confidence in the
    administration of justice [citations omitted]. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    question whether a reasonable person would be satisfied that refusal of bail
    is necessary to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice
    presents the usual difficulties of a reasonableness standard.  Reasonable
    people can disagree.  Without more, there is a danger that the unadorned
    application of this standard could too easily simply reflect a judge’s own
    perspective, resulting in unpredictable and inconsistent bail decisions determined
    by judicial discretion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Parliament,
    recognizing the court’s inability to measure public confidence directly and
    the judicial discretion inherent in identifying it, has specified four factors
    that the court should consider: “the apparent strength of the prosecution’s
    case, the gravity of the nature of the offence, the circumstances surrounding
    its commission and the potential for a lengthy term of imprisonment.”  Courts
    are well able to assess these factors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    importance of the legislative direction that the court consider these four
    factors cannot be overstated.  Their existence was integral to the Supreme
    Court’s finding in <i>Hall</i> that s. 515(10)(c) is constitutional where
    McLachlin C.J.C. explained that the provision did not authorize a “standardless
    sweep” because these four key criteria delineated a basis for the exercise
    of judicial discretion.  She stressed the objective basis of decisions under
    s. 515(10)(c), stating at para. 36:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The inquiry
    is narrowed to the reasonable community perception of the necessity of denying
    bail to maintain confidence in the administration of justice, <u>judicially
    determined through the objective lens</u> of “all the circumstances, including
    the apparent strength of the prosecution’s case, the gravity of the nature
    of the offence, the circumstances surrounding its commission and the potential
    for a lengthy term of imprisonment” [underlining added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  No
    one factor is determinative.  The four factors should be analysed together,
    not separately.  Consideration of their combined effect in the context of
    all the circumstances enables the court to determine whether it is necessary
    to deny bail in order to maintain public confidence in the administration
    of justice.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    515(10)(c) is designed so that a consideration of all the circumstances with
    special regard to the four key factors will result in a determination that
    maintains the public’s confidence in the administration of justice.  For
    example, where each of the four factors is assessed as having maximum force,
    a determination that refusal of bail is necessary to maintain public confidence
    in the administration of justice is entirely to be expected.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8 align=left style='

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    offence in this case, first-degree murder, is of the utmost gravity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    bail judge noted that the Crown has a strong case of first-degree murder.  However,
    he did not explicitly comment on the strength of the Crown’s case for second-degree
    murder, nor upon “the potential for a lengthy term of imprisonment.”  The
    apparent strength of the prosecution’s case for second-degree murder, at
    this stage, is formidable.  Indeed, counsel conceded that the major issue
    at trial will be whether the respondent should be convicted of first or second-degree
    murder.  A sentence of life imprisonment in this case seems highly likely.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    three of the four factors should be assessed at or near their highest levels.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    well, more weight should have attached to the circumstances of the offence.  Explicit
    consideration should have been given to the domestic nature of the murder
    and the extent of the violence used in committing it in assessing the effect
    of release on the public’s confidence in the administration of justice.  In
    this case, it is alleged that the respondent brutally murdered his wife because
    she had left him and had started seeing another man.  As already noted, the
    evidence that he did so is quite overwhelming.  A reasonable member of the
    community would rightly be concerned with the public’s confidence in how
    the justice system responds to acts of domestic violence if the respondent
    were granted bail.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the combined effect of the four statutory factors in all the circumstances
    of the case indicates that the detention of the respondent is necessary to
    maintain public confidence in the way justice is administered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, the application is granted, the order releasing the respondent
    is set aside, and an order returning the respondent to detention is substituted.</p>
