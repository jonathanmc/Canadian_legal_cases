    the context of a Reference to this court directed by the Minister of Justice
    under s. 696.3(3)(a)(ii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, the applicant Crown
    applies in writing for an order under s. 683(1)(a) of the <i>Code</i> compelling
    the respondents, Julian Sher, Theresa Burke and the Canadian Broadcasting
    Corporation, to produce to the parties all audio, video, digital recordings
    and verbatim transcriptions of interviews conducted with eight individuals:  Dr.
    David Hall Brooks, Sandra Stolzmann, Catherine Beaman, Karen Daum, Robert
    Lawson, Dr. John Butt, Supt. H.M. Sayeau and Commissioner H.H. Graham (deceased). </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    circumstances giving rise to this application are as follows.  The respondent,
    Julian Sher, in his capacity as a producer for the CBC programme, “The Fifth
    Estate”, co-produced a documentary about the 1959 conviction of Steven Truscott
    for the first-degree murder of Lynne Harper entitled, “His Word Against History”.  The
    documentary first aired in March 2000.  Sher also authored a book about the
    Truscott case entitled, “Until You Are Dead:  Steven Truscott’s Long Ride
    into History”, which was published in October 2001. The respondent Burke
    was a co-producer of the documentary and did research for Sher’s book.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the course of their research into the Truscott case, Sher and Burke interviewed
    many people involved with the case, including people who had provided statements
    to police in 1959 or who were witnesses in the Truscott trial.  Many of these
    individuals were subsequently contacted by counsel for Mr. Truscott.  Several
    of them provided affidavits that were filed in support of Mr. Truscott’s
    November 2001 application to the Minister of Justice under s. 690 [now s.
    696.1] of the <i>Criminal Code</i> for relief against his conviction.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Four
    of the eight witnesses in respect of whom the Crown seeks a production order
    against the respondents provided sworn affidavits that the appellant submitted
    in his application to the Minister.  Seven of these eight witnesses<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a> were interviewed before the Honourable
    Fred Kaufman by his investigative counsel, Mark Sandler, during the investigation
    that was conducted on behalf of the Minister in relation to Mr. Truscott’s
    application for ministerial review.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    October 28, 2004, the Minister referred the case to our court and directed
    that we hear the Reference “as if it were an appeal by Steven Murray Truscott
    on the issue of fresh evidence”.   On November 30, 2005, the Crown wrote
    to the respondent Sher requesting that he turn over the audiotapes or transcripts
    of interviews that he or Burke had with fourteen individuals who are the
    source of evidence that is being introduced in the fresh evidence appeal.  An
    exchange of correspondence ensued, with the respondents taking the position
    that they would not turn over any of the requested material.  On April 27,
    2006, the Crown commenced the present application in respect of the eight
    witnesses listed above.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    correspondence dated June 6, 2006, the respondents advised the Crown that
    they have not retained the majority of the audiotapes or other records of
    their interviews with the eight witnesses.  The only material they have retained
    is the following:</p>
  <p class=headingsubtitle>1.<span

line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown notes that Mr. Lawson has consented to the release of his interview,
    as has the family of Commissioner Graham.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents’ primary position in resisting the Crown’s application for production
    is that this court does not have jurisdiction under s. 683(1)(a) of the <i>Code</i> to
    make the order requested by the Crown.  According to the respondents, s.
    683(1)(a) does not empower the court to issue a production order against
    a third party to assist the Crown in its investigation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not agree with the respondents’ submissions on jurisdiction or with their
    characterization of the purpose of the requested order.   Part XXI of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> sets out the powers of provincial courts of appeal.  The plain wording
    of s. 683(1)(a) empowers the appellate court to make an order compelling
    production of material that is connected with proceedings before it.   Subsection
    683(1)(a) states:</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>683. (1) For the purposes of an appeal under this Part,
    the court of appeal may, where it considers it in the interests of justice,</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>order the production
    of any writing, exhibit or other thing connected with the proceedings; …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    scope of the phrase in subs. (1)(a), “a writing, exhibit or other thing connected
    with the proceedings”, must be defined by referring to the overriding concept
    of the “interests of justice” that is to guide the exercise of the court’s
    discretion under s. 683(1).  The interests of justice are informed by the
    particular context of the case before the court.  This appeal is a fresh
    evidence appeal.  Moreover, it is an appeal from a conviction that was entered
    some 47 years ago.  It is clearly in the interests of justice that the parties
    are able to put before the court any
    “writing, exhibit or other thing” that may shed light on the credibility
    and reliability of the evidence being tendered by the parties in the proceedings.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents submit that the Crown is using s. 683(1)(a) as an evidence-gathering
    tool and that the Crown should therefore be required to follow the “Special
    Procedures and Powers” provisions in Part XV of the <i>Code</i>, which<i> </i>deal
    with search warrants and production orders.  We do not agree with the respondents’
    characterization of the purpose of the Crown’s application.  The interviews
    by Sher and Burke of the witnesses are not expected to yield evidence of
    the commission of an offence, as is contemplated by the search warrant and
    production order provisions in Part XV of the <i>Code</i>.  Rather, the relevance
    of the requested material lies in its ability to assist the court in deciding
    the admissibility of fresh evidence being tendered by the parties.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents further submit that the Crown has not established a sufficient
    basis to compel production, having regard to the criteria for issuing a search
    warrant under s. 487.012 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and having regard to
    ss. 2(b) and 8 of the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.   For the reasons
    given above, s. 487.012 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> has no application to
    the issuance of a production order in this case.  The Crown is not conducting
    a criminal investigation, nor is it attempting to obtain evidence of the
    commission of an offence.  Rather, it is attempting to procure material that
    may assist the court in determining the credibility and reliability of fresh
    evidence being tendered on this appeal.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    respondents have not attempted to adduce evidence to support their claim
    that the requested order will limit freedom of expression or impair the functions
    of the media.  The respondent Sher baldly asserts in his responding affidavit
    that granting a production order in this case will have a chilling effect
    on investigative reporting and will compromise journalistic independence
    by turning the media into an “arm of the state”.  We see no basis in the
    evidence for these assertions.   The witnesses who gave the interviews in
    question were aware that the respondents were producing a documentary that
    would be televised.   There is nothing in the record to suggest that the
    respondents entered into confidentiality agreements with any of the witnesses.  Moreover,
    Mr. Lawson and the family of Commissioner Graham have consented to the release
    of those two interviews.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    thus falls to be decided whether the Crown has demonstrated that it is in
    the interests of justice under s. 683(1)(a) that the respondents produce
    to the parties any of the limited material that they have retained.  </p>
  <p><b>Video recording of an interview with Robert Lawson</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    Lawson’s family owned the farm where Lynne Harper’s body was found.   He
    testified at the trial in 1959 as a witness for the Crown.  Mr. Lawson was
    interviewed by the respondents in preparing their documentary in the late
    1990’s.  Mr. Lawson provided information to them that he had not testified
    to at the trial.  Over a year following his contact with the respondents,
    Mr. Lawson swore an affidavit in support of the appellant’s application to
    the Minister under s. 696.1 of the <i>Code</i>.  This affidavit referred
    to the same new information.  He also testified under oath before the Honourable
    Fred Kaufman regarding this new information.   The Crown intends to cross-examine
    Mr. Lawson in the current proceedings.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is in the interests of justice that the parties be given the videotape of
    Mr. Lawson’s interview with the respondents so that the court will be in
    a better position to assess the credibility and reliability of the fresh
    evidence from Mr. Lawson.  With the </p>

    or inconsistencies in statements made by Mr. Lawson prior to his involvement
    with Mr. Truscott’s review application.  The parties will also be able to
    make submissions as to whether the respondents’
    manner of questioning Mr. Lawson had any impact on his recollections of events
    that took place over 40 years before the interview. </p>

    Butt is an expert on the subject of the pathology of sudden death and serious
    injury.  He prepared a report dated October 2001 addressing pathology aspects
    of the death of Lynne Harper. The appellant relied on this report in his
    application to the Minister and he is also relying on that report in the
    appeal to this Court.   Dr. Butt, as an expert witness, is in a different
    category of witness than Mr. Lawson.  Dr. Butt did not provide evidence at
    the trial or at the Reference to the Supreme Court of Canada in 1966. There
    is no issue whether Dr. Butt’s memory has faded or has been affected by interviews
    with the respondent journalists.   The court would not be assisted in the
    task of assessing the weight that is to be given to Dr. Butt’s expert opinion
    by having access to the respondents’
    interview with him.  Accordingly, it is not in the interests of justice that
    this interview be produced. </p>

    Graham, formerly Inspector Graham, was the Ontario Provincial Police officer

    allegedly were not disclosed to the defence.  This court is not being asked
    to determine the credibility or reliability of testimonial fresh evidence
    from Commissioner Graham.  However, the Crown asserts that there is an issue
    in this appeal as to whether Commissioner Graham was in fact the author of
    certain notes that the appellant is relying on as part of his documentary
    fresh evidence.  It is possible that Sher or Burke raised this issue in their
    interview with Commissioner Graham.  It is thus in the interests of justice
    that the parties be given the videotape of this interview because it may
