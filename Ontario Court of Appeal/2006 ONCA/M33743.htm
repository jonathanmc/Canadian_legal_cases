      Pannell brings this application for his judicial interim release.  The
      United States of America (the “United States”) seeks his extradition so
      that he can be tried for attempted second-degree murder, aggravated battery
      and bail jumping.  Mr. Pannell requests that he be released from custody
      pending his appeal to this court from the order for his committal into
      custody.  He also requests that he be released from custody pending the
      Minister of Justice’s decision respecting his surrender.  Mr. Pannell has
      been in custody since his arrest on July 27, 2004. </span></p>

      United States alleges that, some thirty-seven years ago, Mr. Pannell shot
      a uniformed police officer.  Mr. Pannell was released on bail twice after
      his arrest for the shooting.  He failed to appear in court both times.  Sometime
      after he breached the second bail, Mr. Pannell entered Canada under the
      name Douglas Gary Freeman.  Since then, he has lived and raised a family
      in Canada and has been an active member of the community.  The American
      Authorities discovered Mr. Pannell’s presence in Canada in 2004.  He was
      then arrested and the United States sought his extradition. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      is not the first time that Mr. Pannell has requested a judicial interim
      release.  He has twice been before Nordheimer J., seeking first a judicial
      interim release and later a review of that first decision.  Both times
      the court denied his request.  He also unsuccessfully appealed Nordheimer
      J.’s second decision to this court.</span></p>

      the reasons that follow, I decline to grant Mr. Pannell’s request for bail.  I
      have concluded that the proposed plan of supervision does not adequately

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It
      is the United States’ position that on March 7, 1969, Mr. Pannell shot
      a police officer in the City of Chicago.  The officer, Mr. Terrence Knox,
      was on uniformed patrol in a marked police cruiser.  He stopped Mr. Pannell
      and inquired why he was not in school.  Mr. Pannell allegedly responded
      by producing a 9-millimeter handgun and shooting into the police cruiser
      multiple times.  The officer returned fire.  One of the bullets shot by
      Mr. Pannell severed an artery in Mr. Knox’s right arm.  He suffered serious
      and permanent injuries.  Mr. Pannell was arrested after a foot chase.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
      Pannell was brought to Mr. Knox at hospital where he positively identified
      Mr. Pannell as the shooter.  Three eyewitnesses also identified him as
      the shooter.  Further, a handgun that Mr. Pannell was seen dropping after
      the shooting was recovered and subsequent ballistic tests matched that
      handgun with the cartridges found at the scene of the shooting.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
      Pannell was released on bail on November 23, 1970, almost a year and a
      half after his arrest.  On June 19, 1972, he was arrested by the Chicago
      police for his failure to appear on the attempt murder charges.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
      Pannell was granted bail a second time.  Again, he failed to appear in
      court two years later on July 23, 1974.  Although an arrest warrant was
      issued, Mr. Pannell remained at large until his recent arrest in Canada.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Sometime
      in 1974, Mr. Pannell left the United States and moved to the province of
      Quebec.  He adopted the name Douglas Gary Freeman.  He settled in Quebec
      and married Ms. Dasilva-Coelho.  Prior to their marriage, he told her his
      real name and that he had shot a police officer in Chicago in self-defence.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      1987, Mr. Pannell and his family – he has two children with his current
      wife and two from a previous relationship – moved to Mississauga.  They
      bought a house there.  Both Mr. Pannell and his wife worked for the Toronto
      Library.  He was a law-abiding citizen, with the exception of a single
      customs violation, relating to a camera, for which he received a $300 fine
      in 1983.  None of Mr. Pannell’s friends or co-workers knew of his past
      until his arrest.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
      part of an audit by the court administration to ensure that all outstanding
      warrants were in the computer system, an arrest warrant for Mr. Pannell
      was reissued on October 29, 2002.  In a
    “cold case” investigation in April 2004, Interpol Washington sent Pannell’s
    fingerprints to the RCMP.  They matched Mr. Pannell’s prints to those taken
    in relation to his customs violation.  Pannell was arrested on July 27, 2004
    and the United States sought his extradition.</span></p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'><u>Procedural History</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      August 25, 2004, Mr. Pannell applied for bail pending his extradition hearing.  Justice
      Nordheimer denied his application and ordered Mr. Pannell detained.  Central
      to Nordheimer J.’s determination was his conclusion that Mr. Pannell posed
      a flight risk.  He found that, despite the several sureties put forward
      by Mr. Pannell, he had failed to provide an effective plan of supervision.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
      Pannell did not appeal this decision.  Instead, he applied for a review
      of the August 25, 2004 detention order in early November 2004.  At that
      review, counsel for Mr. Pannell submitted a modified plan of supervision.  The
      first change was that the duties of four of the sureties had been enhanced.  Specifically,
      Mr. Pannell’s mother-in-law was prepared to move from her home in Laval,
      Quebec to live with Mr. Pannell and her daughter in their home in Mississauga.  This
      would enable her to maintain a constant supervision of Mr. Pannell.  Also,
      the other three sureties said that they would co-ordinate with each other
      to ensure that Mr. Pannell was directly supervised within his residence
      at all times.  The second change was that Mr. Pannell had made private
      arrangements for the electronic monitoring of his movements.  These two
      changes, he argued, constituted a material change in circumstances that
      warranted his interim release from custody.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>On
      November 8, 2004, Nordheimer J. dismissed the application.  On the first
      proposed change, he found that he had no basis upon which to conclude that
      Mr. Pannell would be amenable to the supervision of his mother-in-law.  Although
      they had a close relationship, he observed that the relationship was based
      on a fundamental deception as to his true identity. </span> Further, Nordheimer
      J. noted that Mr. Pannell had not given any evidence on the application;
      he had not said that he would be respectful and obedient of his mother-in-law’s
      directions.  The application judge therefore continued to have serious
      doubts that Mr. Pannell would subjugate his own interests to those of his
      in-laws.  On the second change, the application judge considered the electronic
      monitoring system to be of limited value.  He did so for two key reasons.  First,
      the system in no way restricted a subject’s movements.  Second, if a subject
      moved outside of the designated area, the monitoring system did not assist
      in locating the person.  Thus, if there existed concerns of Mr. Pannell’s
      risk of flight, the monitoring system did not alleviate those concerns.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nordheimer
    J. again weighed the plan of supervision against the risk that Mr. Pannell
    might leave the jurisdiction.  He repeated that it was not difficult to envision
    a scenario where Mr. Pannell and his wife would decide to flee to another
    jurisdiction rather than allow Mr. Pannell to be extradited to the United
    States.  Also, Mr. Pannell had twice failed to appear before the courts in
    the United States.  Finally, the application judge noted that Mr. Pannell’s
    ability to live in Canada illegally for about thirty years without detection
    demonstrated that he had the capability and resourcefulness to make a further
    escape if he wished to do so.  He accepted that Mr. Pannell was a law-abiding
    citizen for the last thirty years.  However, that was discounted somewhat
    by the reality that a person living in a country illegally has a strong incentive
    to keep his activities far from the attention of the authorities.  Nordheimer
    J. concluded that these factors created a risk of flight that was not overcome
    by the modified plan of supervision.</p>

      Pannell appealed this decision to the Ontario Court of Appeal, requesting
      an order vacating the detention order made on November 8, 2004.  On January
      6, 2005, MacPherson J.A. dismissed the appeal from Nordheimer J.’s order.  He
      found there to be no error in principle in the application judge’s reasons.  </span></p>

      surrender to the United States.  </span></p>

    proposed before Nordheimer J.  Mr. Pannell is now fifty-seven years old.  The
    record and proposal before me has, however, been supplemented in several
    ways.  First, an additional surety, Claudio Cester has been added.  Mr. Cester
    has indicated that he is willing to sign a surety in the amount of $75,000
    and that he will work in concert with the other sureties to ensure the supervision
    of Mr. Pannell.  Second, Mr. Pannell has filed an affidavit in which he says
    that his failure to appear in court, as required by the terms of his bail
    in the United States, was a result of his fearing for his life.  Mr. Pannell
    has also addressed one of Nordheimer J.’s concerns by confirming in his affidavit
    that his relationship with his in-laws is extremely close and loving and
    that he would do nothing to betray their love and trust.  In addition, Mr.
    Pannell has explained that he understands the trust that has been put in
    him by his in-laws and the sureties and that he would do nothing to compromise
    the substantial surety proposed by them.</p>

      to the flight risk, the applicant submits that the proposal being made
      is superior to the one considered by Nordheimer J. and addresses the concerns
      that led Nordheimer J. to refuse conditional release in 2004.  Specifically,
      the surety being posted has been improved by raising the amount from $150,000
      to $225,000.  There is now a fourth person who will assist Mr. Pannell’s
      mother-in-law in ensuring that Mr. Pannell abides by the terms and conditions
      of release, including the condition that he remain within his residence
      at all times except for court and medical appointments.  More significantly,
      however, is the fact that Mr. Pannell has now filed an affidavit in which
      he confirms that he has an extremely close and loving relationship with
      his mother-in-law and father-in-law, that he would do nothing to betray
      their love and trust, and that he would do nothing to compromise the surety
      that has been posted by them and by his four friends.  This directly addresses
      one of the concerns expressed by Nordheimer J. where in his November 8,
      2004 decision he stated: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span

      be obedient to, the directions of his mother-in-law.  As a consequence,
      I have serious doubts as to how willing the applicant would be to subjugate
      his own interests to those of his in-laws in these circumstances.</span></p>

      affidavit of Mr. Pannell also explains that he breached his bail terms
      in the United States because he feared for his life.  He describes the
      circumstances of African Americans in Chicago during the early 1970s and
      relates the threats made to him as well as the injury he suffered when
      shot while on bail.  Counsel for the applicant submits that the circumstances
      that caused Mr. Pannell to breach the conditions of his release in the
      1970s are no longer present.  This explanation together with all the other
      material filed should now provide a sufficient foundation to conclude that
      Mr. Pannell will respect the conditions of release imposed by a Canadian

      to continue.  He remains presumed innocent of the charges in the United
      States and, in the applicant’s view, there are significant problems with
      the American government’s case on the outstanding charges.  Further, I
      should take into account the fact that Mr. Pannell has spent nearly two
      years in custody here in Canada pending the final decision on his surrender.</span></p>

      Nordheimer J.’s findings.  The Crown also recognizes that the proposal
      being made here is superior to the one proposed in 2004.  However, the
      Crown submits that there have been changes in circumstances that have strengthened
      the case for continued detention.  Central to this submission is the fact
      that Watt J. has now ordered committal, and Mr. Pannell is now much closer
      to being returned to the United States than he was in 2004.</span></p>

      in the materials suggests that Mr. Pannell’s view of the American justice
      system and his perceived chances of receiving a fair trial have changed.  Although
      Mr. Pannell has the right to appeal court rulings and resist surrender,
      the Crown considers the appeal and submission to the Minister to be without
      merit and submits that Mr. Pannell is simply taking full advantage of the
      delays available to him in the system.  This, the Crown says, suggests
      that Mr. Pannell has no intention of returning to the United States to
      face charges.  The closer he gets to the final decision, the more likely
      he is to breach his bail terms in the same way that he has done twice before.</span></p>

      facts before me, the central issue is whether the applicant has met the
      679(3)(b) requirement and established that he would surrender himself into
      custody in accordance with the terms of any release order.  The flight
      risk is essentially the same whether the surrender issue is considered
      in the judicial interim release pending appeal application context, the
      judicial interim release pending the Minister’s decision context, or in
      the context of both applications being considered together.  The merits
      and public interest considerations of both applications are quire similar
      and, as I will explain, insufficient to overcome the concerns respecting
      flight.</span></p>

      to the submissions made to the Minister, the applicant listed several reasons

      the applicant focused on two points: that the surrender would be unjust
      and oppressive under all of the circumstances and that the applicant’s
      position in the American proceedings may be prejudiced because of his race.  The
      essence of the applicant’s submission to the Minister is that, he, as an

      ultimate decision.  It is, however, fair to say that absent a change in

      in the same manner.  It also provides no explanation as to why, if this
      fear for his life has now receded, he has not returned to face the charges
      in Illinois.  Given the seriousness of the charges, I can only conclude
      that his flight risk remains a concern and becomes more so as his surrender
      order approaches.  I say this recognizing that Mr. Pannell’s concerns respecting
      the likelihood of a fair trial in the United States and the failure to
      respect his commitments to the United States justice system to appear in
      court do not necessarily mean that Mr. Pannell does not respect the Canadian
      justice system and would breach a commitment to appear given to a Canadian
      court.  </span></p>

      respect to Mr. Pannell’s family ties, Mr. Pannell’s children are all adults.  His
      mother-in-law is no doubt committed to assisting Mr. Pannell.  I do not
      doubt her sincerity, but I note that the relationship they developed was
      based on a fundamental deception as to his true identity.  Other than his
      wife, who has been a party to the deception, there is little tying him
      to Canada.  Rather than face a trial he believes will be unfair and a potentially
      significant period of incarceration in the United States, it is, as Nordheimer
      J. stated, not “difficult to see a scenario where Mr. Pannell and his wife
      might decide that life in another jurisdiction might be better than the
      prospect of Mr. Pannell being extradited to the United States.”  History
      demonstrates that the applicant has the ability and resourcefulness to
      make good a further escape is if he is of a mind to do so.</span></p>

      all of the foregoing reasons, I find that Mr. Pannell’s risk of flight
      is significant.  On this record and taking into account the proposed plan
      of supervision, the applicant has not established that Mr. Pannell will,
      if he is released, surrender himself into custody in accordance with the
      terms of any order.  This conclusion applies whether I carry out the s.
      679(3)(b) analysis separately for each of the application pending appeal
      and the application pending the decision on surrender or both applications
      together.</span></p>

      in the s. 679(3)(c) public interest considerations does not alter this
      conclusion.  Although, the presumption of innocence and lengthy period
      of incarceration pending the surrender decision weigh in favour of release,
      these are counterbalanced by the seriousness of the underlying charges
      and Canada’s responsibility to our treaty partners; they do not overcome
      the flight concerns.</span></p>

      conclusion, I dismiss the application without prejudice to Mr. Pannell
      bringing a new application once the Supreme Court of Canada releases its

      Pannell seeking relief under s. 20(c) of the <i>Extradition Act</i> once
      the Minister issues his decision on surrender.</span></p>
