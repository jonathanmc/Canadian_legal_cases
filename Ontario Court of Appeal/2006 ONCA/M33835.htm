    the context of a Reference to this court directed by the Minister of Justice
    under s. 696.3(3)(a)(ii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, the parties seek the
    direction of the court on the scope of the issues to be raised on this Reference.   We
    are prepared to decide the matter on the basis of the detailed written submissions
    that the parties have provided.<i></i></p>

    the legal events preceding it in order to put the current Reference in context.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was convicted of capital murder on September 30, 1959, when he
    was fourteen-years old.  The Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal on January
    20, 1960.  The Supreme Court of Canada refused his application for leave
    to appeal on February 24, 1960.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    April 26, 1966, the Governor General in Council directed a Reference of the
    case to the Supreme Court of Canada, motivated in part by “widespread concern
    as to whether there was a miscarriage of justice in the conviction of Steven
    Murray Truscott”.  The question referred to the Supreme Court for its determination
    was:<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>Had an appeal by Steven Murray Truscott been made to
    the Supreme Court of Canada, as is now permitted by section 597A of the Criminal
    Code of Canada, what disposition would the Court have made of such an appeal
    on a consideration of the existing record and such further evidence as the
    court, in its discretion, may receive and consider?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    hearing the evidence of 26 witnesses, the majority of the Supreme Court of
    Canada (Hall J. dissenting) concluded that it would have dismissed the appeal:  see
    [1967] 2 C.C.C. 285.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 28, 2001, the appellant applied to the federal Minister of Justice
    under s. 690 [now s. 696.1] of the <i>Criminal Code</i> to review his conviction
    to determine if there was a reasonable basis to conclude that a miscarriage
    of justice likely occurred.  On January 24, 2002, the Honourable Fred Kaufman
    was retained to conduct an investigation and to provide advice and recommendations
    to the Minister.  His lengthy investigative report was provided to the Minister
    in April 2004.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    October 28, 2004, the Minister of Justice granted the Appellant’s s. 696.1
    application and referred the appellant’s case to the Court of Appeal on the
    following terms:<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>I HEREBY respectfully refer this matter to this Honourable
    Court pursuant to s. 683.3(3)(a)(ii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, based on
    a consideration of the existing record herein, the evidence already heard
    and such further evidence as this Honourable Court in its discretion may
    receive and consider, to determine the case as if it were an appeal by Steven
    Murray Truscott on the issue of fresh evidence.</p>
  <h2>&nbsp; </h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown’s position is that the current Reference is limited to the issue of
    fresh evidence.  The Crown further submits that factual issues that the appellant
    raised on his s. 696.1 application for ministerial review, which the Honourable
    Fred Kaufman did not view as significant, fall outside the scope of this
    Reference.  According to the Crown, the scope of the Reference should be
    limited to a consideration of the following two <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>questions:<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>(a) Whether the proposed fresh evidence tendered to establish
    that the “new and significant” archival documents that existed in 1959 and
    1966, were not disclosed to the defence, is admissible.</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>(b) Whether the proposed fresh evidence of witnesses
    found to offer “new and significant” information, relied upon by the Appellant,
    is admissible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown also contends that it is not the function of our court to evaluate
    the reasoning and decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in the 1966 Reference.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant agrees that the Reference is limited to the issue of fresh evidence.  He
    does not agree that the Honourable Fred Kaufman’s conclusions on what evidence
    is
    “significant” should be used by our court to limit the scope of the Reference.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to the appellant, there are two distinct categories of fresh evidence upon
    which this court is being asked to admit and act upon.  The first relates
    to witness statements and other documents that were not disclosed to counsel
    for the appellant at his trial in 1959 nor at the Reference to the Supreme
    Court of Canada in 1966.  The second body of fresh evidence arose between
    1959 to the present day and “addresses matters on which the Crown’s case
    at trial rested”.   Some of this second body of evidence was before the Supreme
    Court in 1966, while other aspects were uncovered during or after the Honourable
    Fred Kaufman’s investigation.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that he does not seek relief in the Reference on the ground
    that the Supreme Court’s judgment exhibits legal error; but he does contend
    that this judgment “is not an impediment to this Court’s plenary jurisdiction,
    conferred by the Reference, to consider the effects of all the undisclosed
    and fresh evidence which has come into existence since 1959 on the conviction
    registered by the jury”.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    terms of the Reference ask us to decide the case as if it were an appeal
    on the basis of fresh evidence.  We are asked to consider the fresh evidence
    in the context of the entire record to date, not just the trial record, but
    also the record as it was expanded on the 1966 Reference before the Supreme
    Court of Canada.  We do not agree with the appellant’s suggestion that evidence
    that was before the Supreme Court in 1966 can constitute fresh evidence for
    the purpose of the current Reference.  When one reviews the terms of the
    Reference, including the recitals, it is clear that
    “fresh evidence” refers to material that was not before the trial court,
    the Ontario Court of Appeal, or the Supreme Court of Canada.  The “new information” referred
    to in the terms of Reference refers to material that was not presented in
    prior court proceedings.  The determination of the admissibility of the “new
    information” for purposes of the Reference will depend on our application
    of the principles for admitting fresh evidence.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    do we agree with the Crown’s submission that the Honourable Fred Kaufman’s
    comments in his Report on the significance of some of the material placed
    before him can in anyway serve to limit our determination of what constitutes
    fresh evidence for the purpose of the Reference.  There is nothing in the
    terms of Reference that would suggest that the Minister of Justice intended
    that the Honourable Fred Kaufman’s findings should act as a filter on the
    material that the appellant or the Crown can put before us on the Reference.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties agree that the appellant cannot seek to quash his conviction based
    on legal error in the Supreme Court of Canada’s judgment on the Reference.  We
    also agree that the current Reference is not concerned with reviewing the
    judgment on the earlier Reference for legal errors.  The determination of
    how, if at all, the Supreme Court’s judgment affects the consideration of
    the current Reference is best left until after the witness examinations and
    until after the parties have made their submissions in the final <i>facta</i> and
    in oral argument.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also cites jurisprudence from the United Kingdom for the view that
    the safety of a conviction that occurred in a different legal era can be
    judged against present day legal standards.  Again, the issue of how contemporary
    legal principles and standards of fairness are to be applied to a case that
    was prosecuted 46 years ago can be resolved after the fresh evidence is tendered
    and the parties’ submissions received. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    final point of contention between the parties is the meaning of certain directions
    that were given by our court on December 14, 2004 to facilitate the fair,
    just and expeditious hearing of the Reference.  In these directions, the
    court defined the
    “Record” for the Reference as follows:<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>The Record shall consist of the entire record available
    to the Honourable Fred Kaufman in the preparation of his Report to the Minister.  The
    Record may be supplemented by such further material as the parties see fit
    to tender and the court sees fit to receive (Supplementary Record). Unless
    otherwise ordered, the Report prepared by Mr. Kaufman shall not form part
    of the Record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown submits that the record before the court on the Reference does not
    include the testimony taken by the Honourable Fred Kaufman under oath and
    since filed with this Court under seal.  The appellant submits that this
    material is part of the record because of the language of the Reference,
    which refers to
    “evidence already heard”, and by virtue of our December 2004 ruling.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the appellant’s submission that this material is part of the record
    by virtue of our ruling.  However, this does not mean that the transcript
    evidence will necessarily qualify as fresh evidence.  It simply means that
    the transcripts are available to the parties and to the court on the Reference.  The
    parties will need to satisfy the court that the transcripts of the examinations
    before the Honourable Fred Kaufman on which they seek to rely are admissible
    before this court.  We point out that absent agreement of the parties dispensing
    with this requirement, an examination taken under oath before the Honourable
    Fred Kaufman, but not put in the usual form for fresh evidence applications
    is not admissible for its truth unless some exception to the hearsay rule
    applies; either an existing exception or by application of the principled
    approach to hearsay.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also submits that the court’s broad definition of the “Record” in
    this endorsement permits the court to rely on a large background of documentary
    information that was before the Honourable Fred Kaufman.  Again, we agree
    that by virtue of our December ruling, the documentary information that was
    before the Honourable Fred Kaufman is available to both the parties and the
    court.  It will be open to the parties to argue whether or not this evidence
    meets the test for fresh evidence.  However, the fact that evidence forms
    part of the record does not determine the basis of admissibility;  in particular,
    whether it is admissible for its truth.  Materials that the parties rely
    on for their truth must be shown to fall within an established hearsay exception
    or be otherwise admissible through application or extension of a principled
    approach as, for example, by application or extension of the principles in <i>R.
    v. Finta</i> (1992), 73 C.C.C. (3d) 65 (Ont. C.A.) at 196-204.  Additionally,
    materials forming part of the record may be admissible for non-hearsay purposes
    on grounds analogous to cases such as <i>R.</i> v. <i>Dixon </i>(1998), 122
    C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) and <i>R. v. Taillefer</i> (2003), 179 C.C.C. (3d)
    353 (S.C.C.).  </p>
