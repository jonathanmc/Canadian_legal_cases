    this court under s. 696.3(3)(a)(ii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985,
    c. C-46 in the matter of the conviction of Steven Truscott on a charge of
    murder in 1959.  This court has been asked to decide the case as if it were
    an appeal by Mr. Truscott on the issue of fresh evidence.<i></i></p>

    the context of this Reference, the appellant (“applicant”) brings an application
    in writing for the production of nursing school evaluation records and specified
    medical records pertaining to Jocelyne Gaudet, one of the Crown’s key witnesses
    at Mr. Truscott’s trial.   We are prepared to decide this application on
    the basis of the written submissions provided by counsel for the applicant
    and counsel for the responding party to the application, Ms. Gaudet.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

    applicant applies for production of two sets of third party records related
    to Ms. Gaudet:  i) the evaluation records formerly held by the Jeffrey Hale
    Hospital in Montreal pertaining to Ms. Gaudet’s performance during her nursing
    rotation at the Douglas Hospital in 1966 (“Douglas Hospital records”); and
    ii) the medical records held by the Sir Mortimer B. Davis Jewish General
    Hospital in Montreal, formerly known as the Jewish General Hospital, that
    relate to Ms. Gaudet’s admission to this institution on or about September
    30, 1966 (“JGH records”).<i></i></p>

line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Douglas Hospital records were obtained by the Honourable Fred Kaufman in
    the course of his investigation on behalf of the Minister into the applicant’s
    conviction.   These records were obtained without Ms. Gaudet’s authorization.  They
    were filed as an exhibit to the examination of Ms. Gaudet, which was conducted
    by Justice Kaufman’s investigative counsel, Mark Sandler, in March 2003.  The
    transcript of this examination was filed as part of the sealed application
    record before us.  The Douglas Hospital records are currently held under
    seal by the Court of Appeal.   The JGH records were produced by the Hospital
    pursuant to a subpoena served on it by the applicant and are also currently
    held under seal by the Court of Appeal. </p>

    Gaudet’s testimony as a thirteen-year-old girl was used to advance the Crown’s
    theory at trial that on the night of Lynne Harper’s disappearance, Steven
    Truscott was looking for Ms. Gaudet who he had arranged to meet near Lawson’s
    bush.  When she failed to appear, his attention turned to Lynne Harper.  The
    Crown also used Ms. Gaudet’s trial testimony to challenge Mr. Truscott’s
    description that he gave in statements to the police of his movements on
    the county road on the evening of June 9, 1959.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant is tendering as fresh evidence on the Reference to this court the
    evidence of Elizabeth Hulbert and Sandra Stolzmann, two witnesses who testified
    before Justice Kaufman in 2002 and before this court in June 2006.  Their
    evidence is being tendered to challenge Ms. Gaudet's credibility and the
    reliability of her trial testimony.   Ms. Hulbert and Ms. Stolzmann have
    given evidence that in 1966, they were nursing students who performed a rotation
    in psychiatry at the Douglas Hospital in Montreal.  Their testimony is to
    the effect that one evening around the time of the rehearing of the Truscott
    case in the Supreme Court of Canada (the Reference before the Supreme Court
    commenced on October 5, 1966), during a social gathering of nursing students,
    Ms. Gaudet<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a> admitted to lying in her testimony
    at Mr. Truscott's trial.  They further testified that Ms. Gaudet sought hospitalization
    at a psychiatric institution in order to avoid testifying before the Supreme
    Court of Canada.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    Mr. Sandler’s examination of Ms. Gaudet, he told her about the version of
    events described by Ms. Hulbert and Ms. Stolzmann.  Ms. Gaudet testified
    that she had no recollection of either woman, she denied being hospitalized
    during her rotation at the Douglas Hospital, she denied having publicly discussed
    her involvement in the Truscott case, and she denied having lied in her testimony
    at trial.  She further testified that she has memory problems caused by a
    brain injury that she suffered sometime after 1984.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Sandler went on to read to Ms. Gaudet certain sections of the Douglas Hospital
    records entitled &quot;Remarks of the Instructor&quot; and “Clinical Experience”.  By
    way of summary of what was read to Ms. Gaudet, the portion of the records
    entitled “Remarks of the Instructor” state that during the period from September
    12 to 28, 1966, Ms. Gaudet initially seemed relaxed and cheerful, but gradually
    became tense and preoccupied with her own problems.  She took some time off
    duty, but when she returned to work, she was too tense and restless to carry
    out her nursing duties.  She rested in a nursing home until arrangements
    were made for admission to the Jewish General Hospital (“JGH”).  The date
    of her admission to the JGH was recorded in the Douglas Hospital records
    as September 30.  After being read this portion of the records, Ms. Gaudet
    responded that she did not remember going to a psychiatric institution and
    she insisted that she had graduated with her class and did not repeat any
    nursing rotations.  <i></i></p>

  <h2><u>Positions of the Parties</u></h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the applicant submits that the requested records pertaining to Ms. Gaudet
    are likely to be relevant as fresh evidence on the Reference.  The applicant’s
    counsel contends that both sets of records will confirm the evidence of Ms.
    Hulbert and Ms. Stolzmann regarding Ms. Gaudet’s admission to a psychiatric
    facility.  Counsel further argues that the records will independently confirm
    that Ms. Gaudet’s fear of testifying before the Supreme Court, or her fear
    of being exposed as a liar if she had to testify, caused her to seek hospitalization
    at a psychiatric institution on the eve of the Supreme Court Reference.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the responding party take the position that the court must be satisfied
    that the proposed fresh evidence of Ms. Hulbert and Ms. Stolzmann is potentially
    admissible as fresh evidence in the proceedings before this court prior to
    considering the merits of the application to produce and receive the third
    party records, citing in this regard <i>R. v. Archer</i> (2005), 202 C.C.C.
    (3d) 60 at para. 102 (Ont. C.A.). Counsel argue that Ms. Hulbert and Ms.
    Stolzmann’s evidence is inadmissible for the truth of the contents because
    their evidence does not meet the requirements for admitting hearsay evidence
    as established by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. K.G.B</i>. (1993),
    79 C.C.C. (3d) 257.  In addition, counsel argue that their evidence does
    not meet the test for admitting fresh evidence as established by the Supreme
    Court in <i>R. v. Palmer</i> (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 193.  Counsel claim that
    because the evidence of Ms. Hulbert and Ms. Stolzmann is inadmissible, it
    cannot be used as a foundation for producing Ms. Gaudet’s school and medical
    records.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In reply
    submissions, counsel for the applicant contends that the court should not
    concern itself at this stage with the question of the admissibility of Ms.
    Hulbert and Ms. Stolzmann’s evidence, nor should the issue of the admission
    of fresh evidence be dealt with here.  These issues must be dealt with on
    the main appeal, after receiving submissions from counsel for the parties
    to the Reference.  At this stage, the court should concern itself only with
    the test for production of third party records as established by the Supreme
    Court of Canada in <i>R. v. O’Connor</i> (1995), 103 C.C.C. (3d) 1.  Alternatively,
    if the court decides that the admissibility of their evidence is to be assessed
    now, counsel submits that Ms. Hulbert and Ms. Stolzmann’s evidence is admissible
    under the principled approach to hearsay and, further, that it satisfies
    the<i> Palmer</i> criteria for admission.<u></u></p>
  <h2><u>Should the Court Rule on the Admissibility of Ms. Hulbert and Ms. Stolzmann’s
      Evidence at this Stage?</u></h2>
  
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with counsel for the applicant’s submission that the issue whether
    Ms. Hulbert and Ms. Stolzmann’s evidence will ultimately qualify as fresh
    evidence under the <i>Palmer</i> test is not the decisive issue on this application.
    Indeed, the question whether their evidence satisfies the <i>Palmer</i> test
    is affected by the outcome of this application, because a determination of
    the credibility, reliability and probative force of their evidence turns
    to some extent on the corroborative effect, if any, of the requested records.
    The issue whether the evidence of Ms. Hulbert and Ms. Stolzmann meets the
    test for fresh evidence will be decided after hearing submissions of counsel
    for the appellant and the respondent Crown on the argument of the Reference.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is necessary at this point, however, to consider whether the evidence of
    Ms. Hulbert and Ms. Stolzmann constitutes potentially admissible evidence.  This
    is because the applicant’s position in favour of production of the third
    party records rests in part on the basis that the requested records will
    confirm the content of the tendered fresh evidence of Ms. Hulbert and Ms.
    Stolzmann.  If their evidence is not potentially admissible because it is
    barred by the hearsay rule, then one of the applicant’s principal arguments
    in favour of production of the records cannot possibly have any force.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Having
    said that, we are satisfied that Ms. Hulbert and Ms. Stolzmann’s evidence
    constitutes admissible evidence in the threshold sense that Doherty J.A.
    discussed in <i>Archer, supra</i>.  As Doherty J.A. explained in <i>Archer</i>:<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>            Fresh evidence is admissible on appeal where
    the interests of justice warrant its admissibility. The criteria governing
    the exercise of the appellate court's power to receive fresh evidence are
    well known and need not be repeated here: see <i>R. v. Palmer and Palmer</i> (1979),
    50 C.C.C. (2d) 193 at 205 (S.C.C.); <i>R. v. Levesque</i> (2000), 148 C.C.C.
    (3d) 193 at 202-203 (S.C.C.). <u>Before these criteria are engaged, however,
    the material must constitute admissible evidence.</u> The rules governing
    the admissibility of evidence in criminal trials apply to evidence proffered
    on appeal under s. 683(1): <i>R. v. O'Brien</i> (1977), 35 C.C.C. (2d) 209
    at 216-17 (S.C.C.); <i>R. v. Babinski</i> (1999), 135 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 21

    are satisfied that Ms. Hulbert and Ms. Stolzmann’s evidence constitutes admissible
    evidence in this threshold sense.  Leaving aside the issue whether the statements
    communicated by Ms. Gaudet to Ms. Hulbert and Ms. Stolzmann are admissible
    pursuant to the principled approach to hearsay, the statements could at a
    minimum be admissible for the fact that they were made.  The fact that Ms.
    Gaudet stated she lied at Mr. Truscott’s trial could be used to question
    the overall reliability and worth of her evidence at the trial.  <i></i></p>

    the records are “likely relevant” to an issue at trial or to the competence
    of a witness to testify.  In other words, there must be “a reasonable possibility
    that the information is logically probative to an issue at trial or the competence
    of a witness to testify”: <i>R. v.</i> <i>O’Connor</i>, <i>supra</i>, at
    para. 22 <i>per</i> dissenting reasons of Lamer C.J. and Sopinka J.  If the
    applicant meets step one, the court will examine the records and will then
    conduct a balancing exercise whereby the applicant must satisfy the court
    that the salutary effects of producing the records outweigh the deleterious
    effects of production:  <i>O'Connor</i>, para. 21.<i></i></p>
  <h2><u>Step One of the <i>O’Connor</i> Test</u></h2>
  
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the context
    of this Reference, the applicant at step one must establish that the records
    are likely relevant to an issue in these proceedings.  Whether or not Mr.
    Truscott had arranged to meet Ms. Gaudet as she testified to at trial is
    a fact in issue in these proceedings, as is the timing of his movements along
    the county road.  Another issue in these proceedings is whether the evidence
    of Ms. Hulbert and Ms. Stolzmann, which is being proffered by the applicant
    to challenge the credibility and reliability of Ms. Gaudet's trial testimony,
    meets the <i>Palmer</i> criteria for admission as fresh evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evidence
    is relevant if, as a matter of logic and human experience, it renders the
    existence or absence of a material fact in issue more or less likely:  <i><span lang=EN-US>R.
    v. J.(J.-L.)</span></i> (2000), 148 C.C.C. (3d) 487 at para. 47 (S.C.C.); <i>R.
    v. Watson</i> (1996), 108 C.C.C. (3d) 310 at 323-24 (Ont. C.A.);  <i>R. v.
    B.(L.)</i> (1997), 116 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at 492-93 (Ont. C.A.).  Under the <i>O’Connor</i> test,
    the burden on the applicant at this stage is to establish the likely relevance
    of the records sought.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the usual <i>O’Connor</i> application,
    the applicant is not aware of the contents of the record being sought.  However,
    in the case of the Douglas Hospital records, the applicant and the court
    are aware of significant content from these records.  The transcript of the
    examination of Ms. Gaudet, which refers to these records, was released to
    counsel for the applicant and the Crown for the purpose of preparing submissions
    on the application to the Minister of Justice under s. 696.1 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  In addition, Justice Kaufman referred at some length to the content
    of the Douglas Hospital records in his report to the Minister, which was
    also provided to the parties.  The transcript and excerpts from Justice Kaufman’s
    report are included in the application materials before us.  From what is
    known of the Douglas Hospital records, they do not refer to Ms. Gaudet’s
    involvement in the Truscott proceedings in any way.  Presumably if the records
    included such a reference, Justice Kaufman would have mentioned this.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Logic and
    human experience would provide some support for the line of reasoning that
    the upcoming Reference into Mr. Truscott's conviction was the cause of Ms.
    Gaudet's preoccupation in September 1966 and that it prompted her admission
    to the JGH on September 30.  However, there could have been a variety of
    other reasons for her admission to the JGH, which were entirely unrelated
    to the Truscott proceedings. Similarly, logic and human experience indicate
    that Ms. Gaudet may have wanted to avoid testifying at the Reference so that
    she would not be exposed as a liar at the trial.  Again, however, there could
    have been various other reasons why Ms. Gaudet wanted to avoid testifying
    at the Reference, if indeed that was her motivation for being admitted to
    the JGH.  Having regard to the test for relevance, the Douglas Hospital records
    do not contain information making it more or less likely that Ms. Gaudet
    lied at Mr. Truscott’s trial, or that she sought admission to the JGH to
    avoid being exposed as a liar.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the Douglas Hospital records and the JGH records satisfy the likely relevance
    test with respect to the issue of the admissibility of Ms. Hulbert and Ms.
    Stolzmann’s evidence.  The existence of the Douglas Hospital records was
    not known until after Ms. Hulbert and Ms. Stolzmann provided affidavits to
    Justice Kaufman setting out their recollections of Ms. Gaudet’s behaviour
    in the fall of 1966.  The known content of the Douglas Hospital records provides
    confirmation for their evidence, insofar as these records confirm that Ms.
    Gaudet was a nursing student in 1966 on a rotation at the Douglas Hospital,
    and that she was admitted to the JGH on September 30, 1966, less than a week
    before the Reference began in the Supreme Court.  Accordingly, these records
    satisfy the test of being “likely relevant” to an assessment of the credibility,
    reliability and probative force of Ms. Hulbert and Ms. Stolzmann’s evidence
    under the <i>Palmer</i> criteria for admission of fresh evidence.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It also
    seems likely that the JGH records will contain other information relevant
    to the credibility and reliability of Ms. Hulbert and Ms. Stolzmann’s accounts.  Furthermore,
    there is a reasonable possibility that the JGH records will contain relevant
    information bearing on whether or not Ms. Gaudet admitted to having lied
    at the trial, or whether she sought admission to the hospital to avoid testifying
    at the Reference before the Supreme Court. The proximity in time between
    Ms. Gaudet’s admission to the JGH and the commencement of the Supreme Court
    Reference makes it reasonable to assume that Ms. Gaudet informed her treating
    physicians of her involvement in the Truscott case or expressed her thoughts
    about the impending Reference.  Any such conversations would likely be documented
    in the JGH records as part of the assessment of her mental state.  </p>
  <h2><u>Step Two of the <i>O’Connor</i> Test</u></h2>
  
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having been
    satisfied that both records meet the likely relevance test, the panel inspected
    the remainder of the Douglas Hospital records and the JGH records in accordance
    with the procedures established in <i>O’Connor</i>.  The second step of the <i>O’Connor</i> test
    requires the court to go on to decide, based on the inspection of the records,
    whether and to what extent the records should be produced to the applicant
    and made part of the public record.<a href="#_ftn4"
name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[4]</span></a>  In
    making this decision, the court must balance the salutary and deleterious
    effects of production on the right to make full answer and defence and on
    the right to privacy and equality, taking the following factors into account:</p>

    production of the record is based on a discriminatory belief or bias;</p>
  <p>e)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    potential prejudice to the personal dignity and right to privacy or security
    of any person to whom the record relates.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on
    our inspection of both sets of records and having regard to the submissions
    of the parties to this application, we would order that the Douglas Hospital
    records be produced to the applicant and made part of the public record.  We
    would refuse to order production of the JGH records and would order that
    they remain sealed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted,
    the Douglas Hospital records provide independent confirmation of Ms. Hulbert
    and Ms. Stolzmann’s testimony that Ms. Gaudet was a nursing student at the
    Douglas Hospital in 1966 and that she was admitted to a psychiatric facility
    on September 30, 1966.  We recognize that Ms. Gaudet has a reasonable expectation
    of privacy in the Douglas Hospital records. However, this privacy interest
    must be contrasted with the far more significant privacy interest that resides
    in records made in the course of receiving medical treatment or counselling
    for sexual assault or sexual abuse.  The Douglas Hospital records relate
    to Ms. Gaudet’s performance as a student nurse forty years ago. Producing
    the records will cause minimal prejudice to Ms. Gaudet’s personal dignity,
    particularly considering that the records do not reveal her current name.  Accordingly,
    the privacy interest at stake is limited and does not outweigh the relevance
    of these records to the issue of the admissibility of the tendered fresh
    evidence of Ms. Hulbert and Ms. Stolzmann.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In contrast,
    the JGH records consist of a mere one-page discharge form and a consent form.  The
    discharge form contains a bald and conclusory diagnosis.  That being so,
    there is not sufficiently probative information in the JGH records to the
    issue at hand to outweigh the responding party’s high expectation of privacy
    in her psychiatric records. </p>
