  <p><b>A motion in an appeal from the judgments of Justice

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is the foundation of an expert’s findings, conclusions or
    opinions subject to production under rule 31.06(3) of the <i>Rules of Civil
    Procedure</i> or does litigation privilege protect such information, even
    though the expert is called to testify at trial?  This motion raises this question and demonstrates the tension
    that exists between rule 31.06(3) and the ‘zone of privacy’ protected by
    litigation privilege. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The four plaintiffs in this action are farmers in Holland
    Marsh, Ontario (the “appellants”).  They
    grow onions, among other things.  Onion
    maggots can attack an onion bulb in its early stage, which causes the onion to
    die.  The severity of attacks by onion
    maggots can be mitigated by the use of pesticides.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Farmers in the Holland Marsh area use one of two such
    pesticides:  Lorsban or Dyfonate.  Lorsban is manufactured by Dow
    Chemical.  The respondents (“Zeneca”)
    manufacture Dyfonate.  Dyfonate is
    designed to protect onion crops from damage by first generation onion maggots.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1995, farmers in the Holland Marsh suffered considerable
    damage to their onion crops when they used Dyfonate but had good results with
    Lorsban.  The farmers who used Dyfonate
    blamed it for their losses.  Some of the
    farmers settled their claims with Zeneca.  The appellants chose, instead, to bring this action against Zeneca.  They claimed that the Dyfonate they used in
    1995 was faulty and failed to properly protect their crops from onion maggot
    infestation.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial of the action took place over thirteen days in March
    and April 2004 before B. Wright J.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants’ position at trial was that the Dyfonate they
    used had to be effective for at least 60 days after planting in order to
    protect against first generation onion maggots. They maintained that damage to
    their crops occurred between 31 and 40 days after planting and that, therefore,
    the Dyfonate that had been used had failed to provide the required
    protection.  The respondents argued that
    a combination of earlier than usual planting of the onion seeds coupled with a
    later than usual emergence of the onion maggot fly lessened the ability of
    Dyfonate to kill the onion maggots at the crucial time period. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Grafius testified as an expert for the respondents at
    trial. In his first written report, dated July 30, 2003, he opined that the
    period of onion maggot control was 60 days. His second report, a PowerPoint
    presentation provided to the appellants on the eve of his examination and
    cross-examination, changed the 60-day period to 45 days. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During cross-examination at trial, an issue arose as to
    whether he had been retained by the respondents’ prior counsel, Ms. Fox.  Dr. Grafius testified that he could not
    recall: whether he had been retained by the respondents’ prior counsel, what
    her name was, any details of conversations he may have had with such counsel,
    whether he had provided prior counsel with a report, nor what he knew about the
    case in 1999.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial counsel for the appellants then requested production of
    Dr. Grafius’s notes and records, saying:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Your Honour, before we break, in light of the
    evidence we have heard, I would like to make a request that we get production
    of the witness’s notes and records.  We
    are usually entitled to the underlying data, and we would like some response as
    to whether, in fact, there was an expert’s report done for Ms. Fox.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the respondents responded in open court.  The transcript shows that the answer given
    was,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I inherited this file in December of 2000, and
    there was no report there.  There was no
    note that Ms. Fox or someone from the office had spoken to Dr. Grafius.  I was asked that question on discovery,
    that’s the answer I gave on discovery. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As explained below, there is a dispute over whether the
    respondents’ counsel said there was “no” note or that there was “a” note.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of the answer given by counsel for the respondents,
    the appellants’ counsel did not pursue their request for production.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By judgment dated June 11, 2004, the trial judge dismissed the
    appellants’ claims.  In his reasons, the
    trial judge stated that the action was dependent on factual findings, namely,
    whether the crop damage in 1995 was the result of poor quality Dyfonate or
    environmental factors.  He noted that
    the respondents’ position was supported by the findings of an <i>ad hoc </i>committee
    and the opinion of Dr. Grafius “who is probably North America’s foremost expert
    on the onion maggot problem”.  He also
    stated that a major failure in the appellants’ case was the lack of expert
    evidence to support their position.  He
    held that the weight of the evidence supported the respondents’ position.  He concluded that, “Unusual or unique
    environmental factors in 1995 caused the onion maggot damage”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several months after the trial had ended and the decision
    rendered, in the course of preparing costs submissions, counsel for the
    appellants discovered what they viewed as an inconsistency between the
    statements given by counsel for the respondents in open court, set out above,
    and the docket entries.  The docket
    entries showed that the respondents’ prior counsel, Ms. Fox, had retained Dr.
    Grafius and had a lengthy telephone conversation with him on March 14, 2000,
    seven months after he had been retained.  Ms. Fox recorded her conversation with Dr. Grafius.  The recording had been transcribed after
    which Ms. Fox spent approximately an hour revising or editing the transcript of
    the conversation.  The result was a
    single-spaced document running 24 pages in length (hereafter the
    “Memorandum”).      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants asked counsel for the respondents to produce
    the Memorandum.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the respondents responded by pursuing the matter
    with the court reporter.  He wrote to
    her saying that there was an error in the transcript, as he recalled saying not
    that there was “no” note but, rather, that there was “a” note.  He asked the court reporter to review the
    recording she had made of the proceeding and, if she saw fit, to revise the
    transcript to show that he had answered the question by saying that there was
    “a” note from Ms. Fox.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reported reviewed her notes and declined to change the
    transcripts, saying that the transcript accorded with her notes.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the respondents then advised counsel for the
    appellants that he refused to produce the Memorandum as it was privileged and
    had not been requested at trial.  Prior
    to that point, privilege had not been claimed over the Memorandum.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants brought a motion before the trial judge in
    which they sought production of Dr. Grafius’s entire file, including the
    Memorandum.  They asked the trial judge
    to: re-open the trial; strike out Dr. Grafius’s evidence and grant judgment in
    their favour; or, declare a mistrial.  In an endorsement dated December 20, 2005, the trial judge dismissed the
    motion on the basis that he would have come to the same conclusion even if he had
    ignored Dr. Grafius’s evidence.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants appeal the judgment of June 11, 2004.  In a supplementary notice of appeal, they
    appeal also the trial judge’s decision to dismiss their post-trial motion for
    production.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal in this matter is scheduled to be heard by this
    court in early September 2006.  The
    appellants move for production of the Memorandum so that they can determine
    whether it is necessary to bring a motion to admit fresh evidence in
    conjunction with their appeal.  Given
    the length of the conversation between Dr. Grafius and Ms. Fox and the time
    spent on the transcripts of that conversation, the appellants believe that Dr.
    Grafius provided Ms. Fox with an oral report that was reduced to writing in the
    Memorandum.  They argue that they were
    deprived of their right to properly test Dr. Grafius’s conclusions at trial
    because they did not have access to the Memorandum.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents oppose production on the basis that the
    Memorandum is the work product of the respondents’ former solicitor.  They say that the conversation between Dr.
    Grafius and Ms. Fox consisted primarily of a general discussion respecting the
    technical issues in the case and that no findings, opinions or conclusions were
    offered by Dr. Grafius.  They argue that
    notes, letters, memoranda and other materials prepared by counsel in
    anticipation of, or during the course of, litigation are protected by
    litigation privilege and that privilege is not waived by production of the
    expert’s report.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>JURISDICTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I raised the question of the jurisdiction of a single judge of
    this court to decide the motion.  I was
    concerned because, arguably, the motion would amount to a final determination
    of one matter raised on appeal, that being the validity of the trial judge’s
    refusal to order post-trial production.  Rule 61.16(2.2) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure </i>stipulates that a
    motion for an order that finally determines an appeal, other than an order
    dismissing the appeal on consent, be determined by a panel of no fewer than
    three judges. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties both expressly stated that they did not want to
    argue the matter of jurisdiction and asked that I decide the matter.  I have proceeded on the assumption that, as
    a single judge of the court, I have jurisdiction to decide the motion.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>RULE 31.06(3) AND LITIGATION
    PRIVILEGE </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The scope of disclosure with respect to the opinions of an
    expert is governed by rule 31.06(3) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>.  That rule reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>(3)  A party may on an examination for discovery
    obtain disclosure of the findings, opinions and conclusions of an expert
    engaged by or on behalf of the party being examined that relate to a matter in
    issue in the action and of the expert’s name and address, but the party being
    examined need not disclose the information or the name and address of the
    expert where,</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span lang=EN>(a) the findings, opinions and conclusions of the
    expert relating to any matter in issue in the action were made or formed in
    preparation for contemplated or pending litigation and for no other purpose;
    and</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span lang=EN>(b) the party
    being examined undertakes not to call the expert as a witness at the
    trial.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Grafius was called at trial as an expert.  As a result, in accordance with 31.06(3), no
    privilege can attach to the findings, opinions and conclusions given by him to
    counsel for the respondents.  The question
    remains, however, whether privilege attaches to the Memorandum. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US><i>The Appellants’ Arguments</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants argue that rule 31.06(3) is not limited to
    final findings, opinions and conclusions.  They rely on <i>Cheaney v. Peel Memorial Hospital</i> (1990), 73 O.R.
    (2d) 794 (S.C. (Mast.)) to argue that the scope of rule&nbsp;31.06(3) extends
    to any finding, opinion or conclusion that can be “expressed in a sufficiently
    coherent manner that it can be used by counsel”, including oral discussions
    such as that which took place between Ms. Fox and Dr. Grafius.  They say that while they cannot know the
    contents of the conversation, the fact that the transcript of the conversation
    is 24 pages in length, single-spaced, and that so much time was spent editing
    the transcript, implies that it was not simply an initial consultation or an
    informal discussion.  They suggest that
    the conversation must have amounted to an oral report, albeit a preliminary
    one.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants also rely heavily on the majority decision of
    this court in <i>General Accident Assurance Co. v. Chrusz</i> (1999), [2000] 45
    O.R. (3d) 321.  <i>Chrusz</i>, they say,
    and the decisions that follow it, such as <i>Browne (Litigation Guardian of) v.
    Lavery</i> (2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 49 (S.C.J.), narrow the scope of litigation
    privilege, most notably in respect of expert reports.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, they say that it is the duty of counsel, as an
    officer of the court, to disclose any coherent findings, conclusions or
    opinions of an expert as they are disclosed to counsel.  They maintain that there was an obligation
    on the part of opposing counsel to disclose the Memorandum prior to trial and
    that the failure to disclose its existence deprived them of the opportunity to
    properly test Dr. Grafius’s conclusions at trial.  Without the opportunity to review the Memorandum, they say that
    it is impossible for them to assess the extent of prejudice they have suffered
    as a consequence of that failure. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US><i>The Respondents’ Arguments</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents submit that the case law does not support the
    broad interpretation of rule 31.06(3) advanced by the appellants and that the
    Memorandum is protected by litigation privilege.  They argue that broadening the scope of rule 31.06(3) would
    radically change the strategies employed by counsel in dealing with expert
    witnesses, which in turn would damage counsels’ ability to put forward the best
    cases for their clients.  They point to <i>Susan
    Hosiery Limited v. M.N.R.</i>, [1969] 2 Ex. C.R. 27 and <i>Hodgkinson v. Simms</i> (1988), 55 D.L.R. (4th) 577 (B.C.C.A.), cases in which the courts have upheld
    litigation privilege and affirmed the need for counsel to maintain the privacy
    of case preparation in order to adequately advise and represent their
    clients.  They quote from <i>Susan
    Hosiery</i>, at p. 34, “If lawyers were entitled to dip into each other’s
    briefs by means of the discovery process, the straightforward preparation of
    cases for trial would develop into a most unsatisfactory travesty of our
    present system”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents note that both the former and current counsel
    for the respondents reviewed the Memorandum and concluded that it does not
    contain any findings, opinions, or conclusions.  They submit that the notes and records on which an expert’s
    report is based are privileged and that privilege is not waived by production
    of the expert’s report.  Similarly, they
    maintain that preliminary drafts of a report are not “findings, opinions and
    conclusions of the expert” within the meaning of rule 31.06(3) and are,
    therefore, privileged.  For the former

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[O]nce a witness takes the stand, he/she can no

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although these comments are made in the context of a criminal
    proceeding, there is nothing to suggest that they are limited to such
    proceedings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At 331 of <i>Chrusz</i>, Carthy J. A., writing for the
    majority and discussing litigation privilege, explains:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]here is nothing
    sacrosanct about this form of privilege.  It is not rooted, as is solicitor-client privilege, in the necessity of
    confidentiality in a relationship.  It
    is a practicable means of assuring counsel of what Sharpe calls a “zone of
    privacy’ and what is termed in the United States, protection of the solicitor’s
    work product.   [citations omitted]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>The “zone of
    privacy” is an attractive description but does not define the outer reaches of
    protection or the legitimate intrusion of discovery to assure a trial on all of
    the relevant facts.  The modern trend is
    in the direction of complete discovery and there is no apparent reason to
    inhibit that trend so long as counsel is left with sufficient flexibility to
    adequately serve the litigation client.  In effect, litigation privilege is the area of privacy left to a
    solicitor after the current demands of discoverability have been met.  There is a tension between them to the extent
    that when discovery is widened, the reasonable requirements of counsel to
    conduct litigation must be recognized.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reasoning in <i>Stone </i>and <i>Chrusz </i>has been
    applied in recent cases, in my view correctly, to diminish the scope of
    litigation privilege.  In <i>Browne</i>,<i> supra</i>, Ferguson J. relied on <i>Stone </i>when taking a broad view of rule
    31.06(3).  He held that the report of an
    expert who was not being called at trial had to be produced because that report
    was referred to by an expert who was being called.  In ruling that the first report was producible, he advocated an
    expansive view of the word “findings” in rule 31.06(3).  He explains the need for such an approach in
    paras. 66 to 72 of <i>Browne</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[66] It is my
    tentative view that our system of civil litigation would function more fairly
    and effectively if parties were required to produce all communications which
    take place between counsel and an expert before the completion of a report of
    an expert whose opinion is going to be used at trial.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[67] I can
    appreciate that discussions between counsel and experts for educational
    purposes might generally best be ruled to be within the zone of privacy
    protected by litigation privilege.  For
    instance, counsel might communicate with the expert to discuss what information
    the expert needed to prepare an opinion.  Counsel might also want to communicate with the expert to discuss
    questions which might be put to the expert or to the opposing expert at trial.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[68] If the
    communications took place before the preparation of the report, then I am
    inclined to think it would [be] best for our system of litigation if they were
    producible because they would influence the opinion and there would be no
    practical way of determining this without producing and examining the
    communications and hearing submissions on the issue.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[69] Any
    experienced counsel who has dealt with experts would appreciate how important
    it would be to know what the expert was instructed to do, what the expert was
    instructed not to do, what information was sent to the expert and the extent to
    which counsel instructed the expert as to what to say, include or omit in the
    report.  McLeish and Smitiuch discuss in
    their article numerous cases which struggled with these issues.  I would guess that every experienced
    litigation counsel knows such influential factors are not rare but
    commonplace.  A recent and alarming
    example was discussed in the recent case of <i>Whiten v. Pilot Insurance Co.</i> (1999), 42 O.R. (3d) 641, 170 D.L.R. (4th) 280 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[70] In my
    view, the disclosure of this information would best enable an opposing counsel
    and the court to assess whether the instructions and information provided
    affected the objectivity and reliability of the expert’s opinion.  I also note there is much contrary opinion
    on this subject: <i>e.g.</i> <i>Mahon v. Standard Life Assurance Co.</i>,
    [2000] O.J. No. 2042 (S.C.J.).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[71] This area
    of the case law cries out for appellate review.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[72] There is
    much cynicism among the bench and bar concerning the objectivity and
    reliability of experts’ opinions in today’s litigation.  I believe requiring full production
    concerning the origins of the opinion would deter inappropriate influence on an
    expert and help restore confidence in the process.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although <i>Cheaney</i> pre-dates <i>Stone </i>and <i>Chrusz</i>,
    it reflects a similar view of rule 31.06(3).  In <i>Cheaney</i>, Master Clark ruled that preliminary findings,
    opinions and conclusions were to be disclosed saying, at p. 798, that “if a
    finding is expressed in a sufficiently coherent manner that it can be used by
    counsel, then it is a ‘finding’ that ought to be disclosed”.  He adds that the same reasoning applies to
    “opinions” and “conclusions”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, in <i>Aviaco International Leasing Inc. v. Boeing
    Canada Inc</i>., [2002] O.J. No. 3799 (Sup. Ct.), Nordheimer J. concluded that
    draft reports had to be produced because they represent the preliminary
    findings, opinions and conclusions of the expert and therefore fall within the
    scope of rule. 31.06(3).  Justice
    Nordheimer expressly endorsed the reasons of Ferguson J. in <i>Browne</i>,
    saying at para. 16, that a party ought to be able to explore with an expert
    whether the expert changed their views from draft to draft and, if so,
    why.  As Nordheimer J. stated, it is all
    part of testing the expert’s conclusions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the reasoning and results in <i>Browne,
    Cheaney </i>and <i>Aviaco</i> are consistent with the reasoning of the majority
    of this court in <i>Chrusz </i>and with the reasoning of the Supreme Court in <i>Stone</i> and are to be preferred to the cases relied on by the respondents.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It will be apparent that I do not accept the
    respondents’ submission that preliminary drafts do not fall within the scope of
    rule 31.06(3).  I would add that I share
    Nordheimer J.’s view, as expressed in <i>Aviaco </i>at para. 16, that it is important
    that such material be produced in advance of the trial so that the trial is not
    interrupted while the material is reviewed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Expert opinion tendered by a party is a unique type of
    evidence.  Although generally retained
    by one side to the litigation or the other, experts are expected to be
    neutral.  Their testimony is meant to
    assist the court and the trier of fact, not to bolster the theory of the case
    presented by one of the two sides.  Their status as experts derives, in significant measure, from the
    assumption that they will offer the court objective opinions on which the court
    is entitled to rely.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule 31.06(3) is to be interpreted bearing in mind the role of
    the expert and the recent jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Canada and this
    court.  As such, a broad approach is
    warranted, one that – in the words of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Stone </i>–
    would enable opposing counsel to have access to the “foundation” of the
    expert’s opinions.  This approach would
    require disclosure of all foundational information for the expert’s report,
    whether or not the final findings, opinions or conclusions expressly reflect
    that information.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consequently, in my view, the Memorandum should have been
    produced prior to trial and I would order its production now.  As I have not seen the Memorandum, I cannot
    know whether it contains preliminary findings, opinions or conclusions.  However, given its length, and the timing
    and duration of the conversation that led to its creation, it is fair to assume
    that it contains foundational information for Dr. Grafius’s final findings,
    opinions and conclusions.  Production
    will enable the appellants to determine whether they were improperly denied the
    right to test Dr. Grafius’s evidence at trial.  Production will also ensure that confidence was properly reposed in Dr.
    Grafius’s opinions by the trial judge.  As the Memorandum appears to record information from Dr. Grafius, I see
    it as part of the foundation for his final findings, opinions and conclusions,
    rather than the work product of Ms. Fox.    </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US><i>Two Remaining Arguments</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents advanced two other arguments in opposition to
    the motion.  Both can be dealt with
    summarily.  First, they argue that what
    the appellants sought at trial was production of Dr. Grafius’s “notes and
    records”.  They say that the Memorandum
    is neither and, as it was not requested at or before trial, it should not be
    ordered to be produced now.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not accept this argument.  The existence of the Memorandum and the fact of Dr. Grafius’s
    conversation with Ms. Fox were, at all material times, unknown to the
    appellants.  I do not see how they could
    pursue production of a document that they, for good reason, did not know of or
    believe to exist.  On the record, it is
    reasonable to assume that had counsel known of its existence, they would have
    requested its production.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents also submit that given the lengthy delay
    between the end of the trial and this motion, the appellants should not be
    entitled to an order requiring production of the Memorandum.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again, I do not accept this argument.  In my view, the matter of delay and any
    prejudice that may result from the delay is properly considered in the context
    of a motion to admit fresh evidence, if such a motion is brought.  In the circumstances, I do not see delay as
    relevant to the question of whether to order production of the Memorandum at
    this stage.  Even if I had been inclined
    to find that delay was a relevant consideration, because the respondents have
    alleged no prejudice and the delay has been satisfactorily explained, I would
    not have given effect to this argument.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I order the respondents to produce the Memorandum
    to the appellants, within ten days of the date of these reasons.  Costs of this motion are reserved to the panel
    hearing the appeal.</p>
