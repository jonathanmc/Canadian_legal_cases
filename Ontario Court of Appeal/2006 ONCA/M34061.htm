  <p class=MsoBodyText>On appeal for an order setting aside the order of Justice
    Eileen Gillese dated July 26, 2006.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>BY
      THE COURT:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents in this appeal move pursuant to rule 61.16(6) to set aside the
    order of Gillese J.A. dated July 26, 2006.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    circumstances leading to the order are as follows.  The appellants sued the
    respondents for supplying defective pesticide.  In August 1999, the respondents’ original
    counsel retained an expert, Dr. Grafius, to assist with the litigation.  On
    March 14, 2000, that counsel had a lengthy telephone conversation with Dr.
    Grafius which counsel transcribed.  Counsel kept the resulting memorandum
    in her file. The respondents’ affidavit of documents asserted privilege over
    all documents and memoranda prepared for the purposes of the litigation and
    the March 14 memorandum was therefore not produced to the appellants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    December 2000, the respondents retained new counsel who did not establish
    contact with Dr. Grafius until April 2003.  Dr. Grafius then prepared an
    expert’s report for the respondents which was served on the appellants eight
    months before trial.  He was then called as a witness at trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants’ action was dismissed with costs at trial, with the trial judge
    relying in part on the expert evidence of Dr. Grafius. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the respondents provided material to the appellants in support of their costs
    claim, the existence of the March 14 memorandum came to light through the
    dockets of the respondents’ original counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants then moved before the trial judge to request production of that
    memorandum.  The trial judge dismissed their request, saying among other
    things, that even if he had ignored the evidence of Dr. Grafius he would
    have come to the same conclusion and dismissed the appellants’ action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants have appealed and now seek to obtain the March 14 memorandum to
    tender as fresh evidence on the appeal, in order to argue that a decision
    based in part on the expert evidence of Dr. Grafius cannot stand, since the
    memorandum was wrongly  withheld from them and could not therefore be used
    to cross-examine the expert.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    memorandum was not produced to the trial judge, Gillese J.A. or this court.  However,
    the appellants put circumstantial evidence before Gillese J.A. by way of
    affidavit from which they asked her to conclude that the memorandum contained
    either a preliminary opinion of Dr. Grafius or “foundational information” for
    his final opinion and was therefore producible to them pursuant to rule 31.06(3).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gillese
    J.A. was unable to conclude that the memorandum contained a preliminary opinion
    by Dr. Grafius and we would not interfere with that finding.  She did find
    that the memorandum contained foundational information for his final opinion.  She
    held that, as such, the memorandum should not be seen as part of counsel’s
    work product protected by litigation privilege, but should be producible
    pursuant to rule 31.06(3).  She therefore ordered it produced  to the appellants.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'><u>ANALYSIS</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants seek to make their case under rule 31.06(3).  It reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(3)            A
    party may on an examination for discovery obtain disclosure of the findings,
    opinions and conclusions of an expert engaged by or on behalf of the party
    being examined that relate to a matter in issue in the action and of the
    expert’s name and address, but the party being examined need not disclose
    the information or the name and address of the expert where,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>(a)            the
    findings, opinions and conclusions of the expert relating to any matter in
    issue in the action were made or formed in preparation for contemplated or
    pending litigation and for no other purpose; and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='
text-align:left;'>(b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    party being examined undertakes not to call the expert as a witness at the
    trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    rule is about the information that a party may obtain on discovery concerning
    the findings, opinions and conclusions of another party’s expert.  It speaks
    to the right to obtain disclosure, whether the information to be disclosed
    is contained in a document or not.  It does not speak to the production of
    documents. The privilege attaching to a document is not erased simply because
    some or all of the information in the document must be disclosed if asked
    for on discovery.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is true that, as a practical matter, the obligation to disclose the information
    in a document is often discharged by simply producing the document.  Indeed,
    probably because of this, much of the case law concerning rule 31.06(3) refers
    to the rule requiring “production.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Holmested
      and Watson </i>at p. 31-106, the learned authors clearly and concisely
      summarize these aspects of the rule:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            Rule
    31.06(3) is concerned with fact disclosure, not with documentary production.  If
    prepared in contemplation of litigation an expert’s report is privileged
    and the report  itself (<i>i.e.</i>, the document) remains technically privileged,
    notwithstanding rule 31.06(3). However, in practice the parties often waive
    this privilege and deliver or exchange expert’s reports in lieu of, or in
    fulfillment of their obligations under rule 31.06(3).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is an area of debate concerning the scope of information that may be obtained
    pursuant to this rule.  It clearly encompasses not only the expert’s opinion
    but the facts on which the opinion is based, the instructions upon which
    the expert proceeded, and the expert’s name and address.  How far beyond
    this the right to obtain foundational information (as our colleague called
    it) extends, need not be determined here.  Suffice it to say that we are
    of the view that it does not yet extend as far as is tentatively suggested
    in <i>Browne (Litigation Guardian of) v. Lavery</i> (2002), 58 O.R. (3d)
    49.  We simply proceed on the basis that the rule entitles the appellant
    to obtain on discovery the foundational information for Dr. Grafius’ final
    opinion.  As will become clear, we need not decide in this case the precise
    extent of the information that is discoverable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    ordering that memo to be produced, Gillese J.A. found that the March 14,
    2000 memorandum contains foundational information for Dr. Grafius’ final
    opinion and that the appellants have the right to obtain that information
    under rule 31.06(3).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accepting
    her finding about the contents of the memorandum, we agree that the rule
    entitles the appellant to obtain on discovery the foundational information
    contained in the memorandum.  However we would part company with our colleague
    on whether the appellants are entitled to obtain that information at this
    stage, after trial.  We think not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    Mr. Gover candidly acknowledged, the record makes clear that the appellants
    knew, prior to trial, that the respondents had obtained original counsel
    and as well, counsel’s identity.  He also acknowledged that the appellants
    had information suggesting that Dr. Grafius had prepared a report for original
    counsel.  Most importantly, the appellants knew of Dr. Grafius’ final opinion
    months before trial.  They had been served with a copy.  They were entitled
    then to seek discovery of the foundational information for that opinion pursuant
    to rule 31.06(3).  It appears that they did not do so. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, there is no basis for them to do so now.  Rule 31.06(3) applies
    to the discovery stage of litigation, which is closed.  It gives the appellants
    no right to obtain disclosure after trial.  Nor should they be otherwise
    entitled to disclosure at this late stage to cure their own failure to properly
    exercise their right to obtain this foundational information on discovery.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not think it is an answer to say that the appellants did not know of the
    memorandum until after trial.  The rule does not give them the right to production
    of the memorandum but rather to obtain discovery of the foundational information
    for the findings, opinions and conclusions of Dr. Grafius contained in the
    memorandum.  That it is a right they had right up to trial.  There is no
    basis in the rule or in fairness to give them the same right, by means of
    the production of the memorandum, now that the trial has been concluded.  For
    the trial process to function fairly and properly, parties must exercise
    their right to obtain discovery at the discovery stage not seek to do so
    after trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    is enough to dispose of the respondents’ request for review.  However, because
    counsel addressed it in argument, we offer this on one other issue:  in our
    view, this case does not suggest a need to modify the rule of litigation
    privilege where experts are concerned.  There is no doubt that litigation
    privilege attached to the March 14, 2000 memorandum.  It was prepared by
    counsel as part of defending the lawsuit.  That was its substantial if not
    its only purpose.  Moreover as is made clear in the recently decided case
    of <i>Blank v. Canada (Minister of Justice)</i>, [2006] S.C.C. 39, which
    counsel forwarded to us, there can be no doubt that this privilege continues
    because the litigation continues.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taking
    as a given that a document protected by litigation privilege and part of
    counsel’s work product contains the foundation for an expert opinion, there
    is no need to remove the privilege for the document itself to do justice.  The
    foundational information in the document is available under rule 31.06(3),
    if it is sought on discovery.  Removing the privilege for the document itself
    is not necessary to obtain that information, but does run the risk of requiring
    disclosure of properly privileged information that is often intertwined with
    discoverable information in the lawyer’s work product.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would therefore set aside the order of Gillese J.A. and dismiss the appellants’ motion.  As
    agreed by counsel, costs of the motion and this review are for the panel
    hearing the appeal.</p>
