      motion judge’s order was made during a lengthy dispute over the ownership
      of Douglas Creek Estates in Caledonia.  Members of the Haudenosaunee Six
      Nations community, asserting Aboriginal title, occupied land owned by a
      private developer, Henco.  Henco obtained an injunction to stop the occupation.
      Some of those protestors who did not vacate the land were found in criminal
      contempt of court.  The Province of Ontario purchased the Henco lands on
      July 5, 2006 and continued its negotiations with the Six Nations community.</span></p>

      protestors from occupying land owned by the Province of Ontario until criminal
      contempt proceedings against individuals violating the injunction had been

      court of the progress of the contempt proceedings.</span></p>

      the hearing of the motion on August 22, 2006, this Court had the benefit
      of the submissions or perspectives of the various constituencies that are
      directly affected by the underlying dispute.  Before the hearing, the Court
      appointed an <i>amicus curiae</i> to present the perspectives of the residents
      of the Town of Caledonia and Haldimand County, and another <i>amicus curiae</i> to

      2 states:</span></p>

      of Henco Industries Limited binds the (new) property owner, Her Majesty

      stay would suspend, until the hearing of the appeal, the motion judge’s
      order  that the injunction obtained by Henco binds the Province as the
      new owner of Douglas Creek Estates.  In other words, once the order is
      stayed, no steps may be taken under it or for its enforcement.  In practical
      terms a stay of paragraph 2 would mean that the mere occupation of Douglas
      Creek Estates would not be a breach of any court order.</span></p>

      question whether the motion judge was entitled to order that the Henco
      injunction binds the Province, and therefore continues in force after July
      5, 2006, raises, at the very least, a serious issue.  Indeed, it seems
      to us that the validity of this order is doubtful.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
      the hearing before the motion judge, Henco, which had obtained the injunction,
      asked that it be dissolved.  The Province supported Henco’s request.  The
      motion judge succinctly captured the Province’s position in these words: “The
      government says we have bought the land and we are allowing the protesters
      to remain.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although
      neither the previous owner (Henco) nor the current owner (the Province)
      sought a continuation of the injunction, the motion judge ordered that
      it would remain in force and would bind the Province until “the criminal
      contempt has been disposed of.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      motion judge gave these reasons for his order:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'><span lang=EN-US>[T]he sale of the property to the crown or the Government
      of Ontario … should have no effect on the court continuing with the criminal
      contempt.  Surely the injunction continues with the property till the court
      dissolves it – if the law were otherwise – an injunction could be defeated
      by transferring ownership.  In my view, the injunction here will bind the
      new owner with notice – as here until it is finally dissolved.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
      doubt that this reasoning is correct in law for at least three related
      reasons.  First, Henco obtained the injunction for its own benefit.  Having
      bought the property, the Province now stands in Henco’s shoes.  As a landowner
      the Province has the right to say whether it wishes the benefit of that
      injunction to continue.  It does not.  It owns the land.  It has the same
      right as any other landowner: to permit the peaceful occupation of its
      property.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
      the motion judge’s reasons assume that an injunction runs with the land – in
      his words: “surely the injunction continues with the property.”  However,
      that principle is not well settled, and there is a body of case law stating
      that injunctions are personal orders that do not run with the land.  See,
      for example<i>, A.G. Birmingham, Tame, and Rea Drainage Board</i> (1881),
      17 Ch. D. 685 (C.A.) 17 Ch. D. 685 at 692 and <i>Iveson v. Harris</i> (1802),
      7 Ves. 252 at 257.  At the very least, whether the Crown, or any subsequent
      purchaser, is bound by an injunction sought by a previous landowner is
      a serious question to be tried.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third,
      the motion judge’s reasons seem to assume that the Province is somehow
      bound as if it were a defendant in this litigation.  The motion judge says “…if
      the law were otherwise – an injunction could be defeated by transferring
      ownership…”  However, the injunction did not require Henco to evict the
      protestors or do anything else.  Henco was the beneficiary, not the target,
      of the injunction.  Therefore, nothing was defeated by the transfer of
      ownership to the Province.  As Henco was not required to remove the protestors,
      the Province, on buying the property, could not be required to do so either.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Province has two roles in this dispute: prosecutor (through the Attorney
      General), and landowner.  As landowner, it seems to us that, subject to
      local municipal requirements and matters of nuisance and public safety,
      it should be free to use its property as it sees fit.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Throughout
      his reasons, the motion judge stressed the importance of the rule of law.  No
      one can deny its importance.  The preamble to our Constitution states that
      Canada is founded on principles that recognize the rule of law.  The Supreme
      Court of Canada has repeatedly affirmed its importance.  (See for example, <i>Reference
      re Secession of Quebec, </i>[1998] 2 S.C.R. 217, and <i>Reference re Resolution
      to Amend the Constitution, </i>[1981] 1 S.C.R. 753.)  The rule of law,
      however, has many components.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Province owns Douglas Creek Estates.  It does not claim that the protesters
      are on its property unlawfully.  It does not seek a court order removing
      them.  It is content to let them remain.  We see no reason why it should
      not be permitted to do so.  If the protesters cause a nuisance or other
      disturbance affecting neighbouring lands or residents of Caledonia, then
      action may be required.  But no evidence was presented to us of any current
      incident requiring the intervention of the Attorney General, the Ontario
      Provincial Police (O.P.P.) or the courts.  </span></p>

      general terms, irreparable harm is harm that cannot be quantified by a
      monetary award.  A public authority can almost always show irreparable
      harm if the stay is not granted by demonstrating that its actions have
      been taken to promote the public interest.  The Supreme Court explained
      this principle in <i>RJR MacDonald</i> at para. 71:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'><span lang=EN-US>In the case of a public authority, the onus of demonstrating
      irreparable harm to the public interest is less than that of a private
      applicant.  This is partly a function of the nature of the public authority
      and partly a function of the action sought to be enjoined.  The test will
      nearly always be satisfied simply upon proof that the authority is charged
      with the duty of promoting and protecting the public interest and upon
      some indication that the impugned legislation, regulation or activity was
      undertaken pursuant to that responsibility.  Once these minimal requirements
      have been met, the court should in most cases assume that irreparable harm
      to the public interest would result from the restraint of that action.</span></p>

      the Province’s actions have obviously been taken to promote the public
      interest.  In discharging its public duty to address the conflict in Caledonia,
      the Province has been required to make some difficult decisions.  These
      decisions included purchasing the disputed property, allowing the protesters
      to remain on the property, and trying to resolve the ongoing dispute through
      peaceful negotiations.  These decisions were taken in the public interest.  Some
      may disagree with the Province’s stance.  We do not think, however, that
      it is the court’s role to question the wisdom of the Government’s actions.  The
      motion judge’s order continuing the injunction by making it binding on
      the Province, thus leaving the protesters to face the spectre of ongoing
      contempt proceedings if they do not vacate the property, threatens to undermine
      the Government’s attempts to resolve this dispute.  </span></p>

      the Attorney General objects to paragraph 1 of the order because he says
      it contemplates ongoing supervision of the process by the motion judge.
      His concern is that the intent and effect of this paragraph is not only
      to require the Attorney General to report on his Ministry’s progress in
      any contempt proceedings, but also to allow the motion judge to interfere
      with the Ministry’s investigative and prosecutorial discretion by directing

      do not read paragraph 1 in that way. In our view, that paragraph contemplates
      only that the motion judge will remain seized of the contempt proceedings
      so that there will be a public forum where the Attorney General may report
      on what steps, if any, have been taken in respect of the contempt of court
      orders regarding the Henco lands.  In the light of our stay of paragraph
      2, that report will be limited to contempt of the court order up to July
      5, 2006.  As paragraph 1 states, the purpose of the report is to apprise
      the court and the public of the status of any such proceedings. There is
      no language that extends the role of the motion judge beyond maintaining
      ongoing proceedings for the purpose of receiving status reports.</span></p>

      date of September 25, 2006 for the argument of the appeal.  It seems most

      the Attorney General submits that the court has already been fully advised
      about all contempt proceedings arising out of the injunction orders during
      the several hearings that were convened by the motion judge to inquire
      into the status of enforcement activity by the Crown. For example, in the
      hearing held on June 1, 2006, counsel for the O.P.P. outlined in open court
      and in some detail the history of the O.P.P. enforcement activity since
      the first incident began in February 2006.  The Attorney General contends
      that there is nothing further to report.  That may be so. However, if it
      becomes necessary to call upon the Crown to provide a more formal report
      to the court summarizing its enforcement efforts, such a report may well
      assist the public in understanding how the authorities are attempting to
