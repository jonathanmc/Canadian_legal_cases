      October 2004, the Minister of Justice for Canada directed a Reference pursuant
      to s. 696.3(3)(a)(ii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> to this court in the
      matter of the conviction of Steven Truscott in September 1959 on a charge
      of murder.  The Minister directed the Reference in these terms:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Based on a consideration
    of the existing record herein, the evidence already heard, and such further
    evidence as this Honourable Court in its discretion may receive and consider,
    to determine the case as if it were an appeal by Steven Murray Truscott on
    the issue of fresh evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      an earlier endorsement setting out the scope of the Reference, this court
      said:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>When one reviews
    the terms of the Reference, including the recitals, it is clear that “fresh
    evidence” refers to material that was not before the trial court, the Ontario
    Court of Appeal, or the Supreme Court of Canada.  The “new information” referred
    to in the terms of Reference refers to material that was not presented in
    prior court proceedings.  The determination of the admissibility of the “new
    information” for purposes of the Reference will depend on our application
    of the principles for admitting fresh evidence. </p>

      court spent several days in June and July 2006 listening to the testimony
      of witnesses called by both Mr. Truscott and the Crown.  The court has
      not heard submissions concerning the admissibility of any of that evidence
      and has not decided what part, if any, will be received as “fresh evidence” on
      appeal.  </span></p>

      Crown seeks to lead the evidence of a witness to whom we will refer as
      Ms. X.  She gave evidence before the Honourable Fred Kaufman concerning
      an incident involving her and Mr. Truscott that she believed probably occurred
      in August 1958, almost a year before Lynne Harper’s murder.  The Crown
      argues that the court should follow the established format of hearing the
      evidence of Ms. X. <i>viva voce</i> and reserving on its ultimate admissibility
      until all of the evidence has been heard and the parties have made their
      arguments.  </span></p>

      for Mr. Truscott submits that the admissibility of Ms. X.’s evidence can
      be fairly determined without hearing her testimony.  Counsel submit that
      the substance of her evidence is well known to the Crown and Mr. Truscott
      and has been placed before the court in transcript form.  Counsel argue
      that the purported evidence of Ms. X. cannot constitute legally admissible
      evidence and, therefore, cannot be received as
    “fresh evidence” on appeal.  Counsel add that a public airing of this testimony,
    especially if it is ultimately ruled inadmissible, would result in a significant
    and wholly unwarranted embarrassment to Mr. Truscott and would infringe on
    his reasonable privacy expectations.  </span></p>

      court received extensive written arguments.  Those arguments address both
      the procedural question, that is, whether the court should hear the evidence

      admissibility issues raised by this evidence.  </span></p>

      sources:  her statement in October 2002 to a police officer who was assisting
      the inquiry conducted by Justice Kaufman at the request of the Minister,
      Ms. X’s testimony before Justice Kaufman also in October 2002, and Ms.
      X’s recorded interview in November 2005 with Crown counsel.</span></p>

      X came to the attention of Justice Kaufman in connection with a matter
      that arose out of testimony provided to Justice Kaufman by another witness.  Ms.
      X was mentioned as being involved in an incident described by this witness.  Justice
      Kaufman eventually determined that the evidence concerning that incident
      was unreliable and it played no role in his assessment.  On this Reference,
      neither Mr. Truscott nor the Crown suggest that the incident occurred or
      place any reliance on the evidence relating to that incident. </span></p>

      X was subsequently interviewed before Justice Kaufman. In the course of
      responding to Justice Kaufman’s inquiries about the incident referred to
      above, Ms. X described another incident.  It is that incident which is
      now the subject of the fresh evidence proffered by the Crown.  She had
      not spoken to anyone connected to the Truscott matter about this incident
      before speaking to the police officer in October 2002.  </span></p>

      X indicated that she and Mr. Truscott were friends in the summers of 1957
      and 1958.  Ms. X., Mr. Truscott and a number of other young teenagers regularly
      congregated at the school near the Air Force base in Clinton.  There was
      apparently very little for them to do in the summertime around the Air
      Force base.  Ms. X. indicated that she and her friends, including Mr. Truscott,
      spent a lot of their time playing on or near the school property.  </span></p>

      X recalled an occasion, probably in the late summer of 1958 (almost a year
      before Ms. Harper was murdered), but possibly late in the summer of 1957,
      when she and Mr. Truscott were at the school looking for something to do.  They
      rode off together on Mr. Truscott’s bike looking for their friends.  They
      found themselves at a cornfield near the Lawson farmhouse.  They were both
      thirteen in 1958.  </span></p>

      X testified that she and Mr. Truscott were having fun together.  She could
      not recall how they came to go into the cornfield.  She thought they went
      about twenty-five feet into the field.  The corn was quite high, but Ms.
      X. could not say whether she and Mr. Truscott could be seen by anyone standing
      outside of the cornfield.  </span></p>

      X testified that she and Mr. Truscott were running around in the cornfield
      in a playful manner when Mr. Truscott made advances towards her.  He tried
      to hug and kiss her and tried to put his hand down her pants.  They tussled
      briefly and may have fallen to the ground.  Ms. X yelled at Mr. Truscott
      to stop and pushed him away.  Mr. Truscott stopped and they left the cornfield.  Ms.
      X could not say how many minutes they were in the cornfield.  They left
      together on Mr. Truscott’s bike.  Ms. X could not recall whether Mr. Truscott
      took her back to the school or to her home.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      X testified that she did not recall being scared by what Mr. Truscott did,
      although she said she was surprised when he tried to put his hand down
      her pants and upset because he nearly ripped her new underwear.  Ms. X.
      remembered the incident because it was the first encounter she had of that
      nature.  When she learned of Ms. Harper’s death a year later, she thought
      to herself that it could have been her.  Ms. X did not mention the incident
      to anyone until a few years after it had happened.  As far as she was concerned
      at the time, she had “handled it”.  </span></p>

      X. also testified that she had never seen Lynne Harper hitchhike.  She
      did not know whether anyone who lived on the base routinely hitchhiked
      into the nearby towns.  She did not hitchhike.  </span></p>

      Truscott was asked about Ms. X.’s statement by Justice Kaufman.  He denied
      that the event described by Ms. X. occurred.  Counsel for Mr. Truscott
      stand by that denial, however, they acknowledge that for the purpose of
      assessing the claim that Ms. X.’s evidence is inadmissible, the court should
      assume that the evidence is accurate and reliable.  </span></p>

      is “in the interests of justice”.  The parties further agree that the exercise
      of this court’s discretion is guided by the well-known criteria for the
      admissibility of fresh evidence on appeal:  see <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C.
      1985, c. C-46, s. 683(1);  <i>R. v. Palmer</i> (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 193

      Crown argues that the ultimate admissibility of Ms. X’s evidence will depend
      on the issues raised on the Reference and the content of any other evidence
      that this court may receive.  The Crown submits that this evaluation can
      only be made at the end of the proceedings when all of the issues have
      clearly crystallized and all of the proposed fresh evidence is before the

      for Mr. Truscott contend that the proffered evidence is clearly irrelevant
      and that this court can so rule without hearing the testimony of Ms. X.  Counsel
      analogize the present situation to that which arises at trial where there
      is an issue as to the admissibility of evidence.  If the dispute over the
      admissibility of the evidence turns on its relevance or some other precondition
      to admissibility, trial judges routinely determine the admissibility of
      the evidence based on a summary of the anticipated evidence rather than
      hearing the entirety of that evidence on a <i>voir dire</i>:  <i>e.g.</i> see <i>R.
      v. Dietrich</i> (1970), 1 C.C.C. (2d) 49 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to
      S.C.C. refused (1970), 1 C.C.C. (2d) 68n (S.C.C.).</span></p>

      Crown’s submission that we should hear the evidence and reserve on its
      ultimate admissibility would have great force if the challenge to the admissibility
      of this evidence depended on whether the evidence, taken with the rest
      of the proffered fresh evidence, could reasonably be expected to affect
      the result of the Reference.  That kind of assessment, which ultimately
      goes to the probative value of proffered evidence, can only be made in
      the context of the entire record and argument:  see <i>R. v. Stolar</i> (1988),
      40 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 10 (S.C.C.).  </span></p>

      objection made to the admissibility of the proffered evidence does not
      go to its probative value.  The objection is directed at relevance, a precondition
      to the admissibility of evidence.  Counsel for Mr. Truscott submit that
      a review of the substance of the proffered evidence demonstrates beyond
      peradventure that it is irrelevant to any material fact in issue in these
      proceedings.  Fresh evidence offered on appeal is only potentially admissible
      if it complies with the rules governing the admissibility of evidence in
      a criminal trial:  <i>R. v. O’Brien</i> (1977), 35 C.C.C. (2d) 209 at 216-17
      (S.C.C.).  Relevance is the first rule of admissibility.  </span></p>

      is relevant if, as a matter of logic and human experience, it renders the
      existence or absence of a material fact in issue more or less likely:  <i>R.
      v. J.(J.-L.)</i> (2000), 148 C.C.C. (3d) 487 at para. 47 (S.C.C.);  <i>R.

      v. B.(L.)</i> (1997), 116 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at 492-93 (Ont. C.A.), leave
      to appeal to S.C.C. refused [1997] S.C.C.A. No. 524.  Evidence will be
      irrelevant either if it does not make the fact to which it is directed
      more or less likely, or if the fact to which the evidence is directed is
      not material to the proceedings.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Relevance
      is contextual in that it depends on the facts in issue, the position taken
      by the parties in respect of those facts, and the other evidence adduced
      in relation to those facts:  see <i>R. v. Arp</i> (1998), 129 C.C.C. (3d)
      321 at 338 (S.C.C.).  Because relevance is contextual, a court will often
      be unable to determine relevance at the time the evidence is proffered,
      but will receive the evidence conditionally and determine the relevance
      of the evidence after the evidentiary picture has been fully developed.  It
      does not follow, however, that because relevance often cannot be determined
      when the evidence is tendered, that relevance should not be addressed when
      the evidence is tendered.  If a court is satisfied when the evidence is

      relevance and hence admissibility based on arguments or material put before
      Justice Kaufman on Mr. Truscott’s behalf.   Finally, we do not agree with
      Crown counsel’s submission that we can find relevance based on arguments
      or further evidence that may or may not be advanced or adduced on behalf

      and unlikely to have raped and murdered Lynne Harper.  To succeed on this

      also reject the submission that Mr. Truscott has put his character in issue
      in these proceedings by statements he made before Justice Kaufman.  Those
      statements, like all other testimony before Justice Kaufman, are part of
      the record on this Reference.  The court has, however, distinguished between
      material that forms part of the record and material that the parties may
      seek to rely upon as fresh evidence:  see our endorsement dated May 25,
      2006.  To this stage of the proceedings, counsel for Mr. Truscott has not
      attempted to put any testimony from Mr. Truscott before this court as fresh
      evidence.  Were counsel to do so, the question of whether that testimony
      puts Mr. Truscott’s character in issue would depend on the content of the
      particular testimony offered as fresh evidence and not on the content of
      all that Mr. Truscott said to Justice Kaufman.  The issue insofar as the
      admissibility of Ms. X.’s evidence turns on whether Mr. Truscott has put
      his character in issue on the Reference, not whether his character was

      add one further observation.  It seems strained, if not inaccurate, to
      speak in terms of Mr. Truscott putting his character in issue before Justice
      Kaufman.  The proceedings before Justice Kaufman were not adversarial and
      Mr. Truscott was not a party to those proceedings.  Justice Kaufman was
      conducting an inquiry to assist the Minister of Justice in the exercise
      of his discretion.  Mr. Truscott, like many other individuals, appeared
      voluntarily before Justice Kaufman and answered questions posed by Justice
      Kaufman and his counsel.  Those questions were wide-ranging and were not
      constrained by the rules of evidence or by an existing <i>lis</i> between
      parties, as would be the case in adversarial proceedings.  It is difficult
      to understand how the concept of putting one’s character in issue has any
      application in the type of inquiry conducted by Justice Kaufman.  </span></p>

      Crown further submits that Mr. Truscott has put his character in issue
      by suggesting in his proposed fresh evidence and elsewhere that there are
      other persons who were more likely to have killed Ms. Harper than him.  Crown
      counsel equates Mr. Truscott’s position to that of an accused who points
      to a third party as the perpetrator and leads evidence of that third party’s
      disposition to commit the criminal act in issue.  In those cases, courts
      have held that an accused has put his own disposition to commit the criminal
      act in issue:  see <i>R. v. McMillan</i> (1975), 23 C.C.C. (2d) 160 (Ont.

      Crown’s analogy fails.  We do not understand counsel for Mr. Truscott to
      tender fresh evidence for the purpose of identifying a third party perpetrator.  Counsel
      for Mr. Truscott claim that the police failed to identify and adequately
      investigate other named and unnamed potential suspects because the police
      had rushed to judgment against Mr. Truscott.  Counsel also argue that inadequate
      disclosure by the Crown of the potential involvement of others prevented
      Mr. Truscott’s counsel from effectively investigating other potential suspects
      and assisting Mr. Truscott in establishing his innocence.  As we understand
      it, counsel will argue that the inadequate investigation and the failure
      to provide the required disclosure taints both the fairness of the process

      these proceedings.  In effect, the Crown argues that Mr. Truscott starts

      Court of Canada in 1966 and the assessment of his credibility by the majority
      of that court are part of the record before this court on the Reference,
      but are not part of the fresh evidence.  Credibility can only be a fact
      in issue in these proceedings insofar as it relates to the credibility
      of persons whose evidence is offered as fresh evidence on the Reference.  To
      this juncture, Mr. Truscott has not given any testimony in these proceedings.  His

      of the attack on parts of the Crown’s case is in no way dependent on Mr.

      police in 1959.  Those statements were introduced at trial by the Crown
      who then set out to demonstrate that they were false.  It would be passing
      strange if the Crown could effectively put an accused’s credibility in

      on this point, even if there were sufficient similarities between the proposed
      evidence of Ms. X. and the evidence of Ms. Gaudet to justify admitting
      the evidence to buttress Ms. Gaudet’s testimony, that reasoning would not
      justify admitting the evidence of Ms. X. pertaining to the sexual assault.  Ms.
      Gaudet’s evidence included nothing about a sexual purpose on the part of
      Mr. Truscott in inviting her to go see the newborn calves.  As counsel
      for Mr. Truscott observed in their submissions, a sexual purpose can be
      assigned to the arrangement with Ms. Gaudet only if one first assumes that
      Mr. Truscott raped and killed Ms. Harper.  As Ms. Gaudet’s evidence made
      no reference to any sexual purpose, Ms. X.’s testimony concerning Mr. Truscott’s
      sexual advances while they were in the cornfield could not possibly make
      Ms. Gaudet’s evidence more credible.  Consequently, even if the Crown’s
      argument were to succeed, it would justify receiving only the evidence
      that Ms. X. and Mr. Truscott went to a cornfield together on or near Mr.
      Lawson’s property about a year before the homicide.    </span></p>

      Crown’s contention that there are
    “remarkable similarities” between Ms. X.’s evidence and the circumstances
    surrounding Ms. Harper’s murder focuses on relatively innocuous similarities
    between the events, such as that they both occurred on or near the Lawson
    property, while ignoring striking, if not overwhelming, differences between
    the two events.  Ms. Harper was the victim of rape and murder.  Ms. X. was
    the
    “victim” of a clumsy sexual advance by a young friend that she quickly and
    effectively brought to an end before any harm was done.  If anything, Ms.
    X.’s testimony would suggest that Mr. Truscott would not react violently
    had he made sexual advances to Ms. Harper that were rejected by her.  </span></p>

      Lynne Harper into Lawson’s Bush, made sexual advances to her, and responded
      to resistance by raping and strangling her.  Insisting upon a comparison
      between a ride on a bicycle that culminated in a minor tussle and a return
      home with the savagery which killed Lynne Harper in Lawson’s Bush ignores
      the vast gulf between the two incidents (assuming there was an incident
