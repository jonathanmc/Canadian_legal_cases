style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Segal is an extraordinarily wealthy man, with a net worth of more than $100,000,000.  When
    it comes to his former spouses, and their children, however, he would have
    it appear that he has no assets.  He now lives in Florida, and played no
    overt part in the trial or the appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the appeal, Idyllic and Ashoe argued that Mr. Segal had nothing to do with
    them – they were owned by mysterious and undisclosed high net worth individuals
    and families operating through international trust vehicles out of the Isle
    of Guernsey.  The appellants submitted that the trial judge erred in a number
    of ways, but in particular (i) by finding that Mr. Segal was the beneficial
    owner of the appellant corporations and further, that he was the beneficial
    owner of the development properties, and (ii) by holding that the properties
    were to vest in Ms. Segal or, alternatively, in making an order to that effect
    rather than imposing some other more suitable remedy such as a charging order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    of the appellants’ arguments on appeal was that the trial judge should not
    have made a vesting order respecting Mr. Segal’s property without Leonor
    Segal having been made a party to the proceeding.  Ms. Segal has two judgments
    against Mr. Segal in Nevada for amounts totalling close to six million U.S.
    dollars, primarily for spousal and child support in relation to the first
    marriage.  The Nevada judgments, however, had not been registered in Ontario.  Nor
    had any steps been taken to enforce them here, pursuant to the <i>Interjurisdictional
    Support Orders Act</i>, 2002, S.O. 2002, c. 13, Part III (“the <i>Act</i>”),
    either at the time of trial or at the time the appeal was argued.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the conclusion of the appellants’ arguments, we rejected all grounds of appeal
    except for those relating to the vesting order.  We reserved our decision
    in that regard on June 7, 2006.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    days later, on June 9, Moses Segal telephoned the adult son of his marriage,
    with Ms. Segal, Andrew (a successful young businessman in Texas), and advised
    him of the appeal.  Andrew contacted his mother.  On June 16, 2006, Ms. Segal’s
    Ontario solicitors attended at the family law office in Toronto to register
    her Nevada judgment pursuant to the <i>Act</i>.  On June 19, they contacted
    the panel, seeking directions as to how to proceed to seek leave to intervene
    in the appeal, and on July 17, 2006, the notice of motion seeking leave to
    intervene was filed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    motion has spawned two additional motions.  First, on behalf of Ms. Lynch,
    Mr. Bastedo moved to quash the motion to intervene on the grounds that Ms.
    Segal does not have the right to register and enforce her Nevada judgment
    under the <i>Act</i>.  The rationale for this motion was two-fold: (a) only
    the Director of Family Support has the right to enforce such a judgment unless
    requested not to do so; and (b) there is no right to register a foreign judgment
    for spousal and child support in Ontario under the <i>Act</i> unless the
    targeted spouse resides in Ontario, which Mr. Segal does not.  The jurisdictional
    issue raised by this second point prompted the Attorney General for Ontario
    to seek leave to intervene as well.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moments
    before the commencement of argument on these motions, counsel for Ms. Segal
    advised Mr. Bastedo that Ms. Segal had withdrawn her request to the Director
    to enforce her judgment.  Mr. Bastedo then indicated that he would not be
    proceeding with Ms. Lynch’s motion to quash, and it was withdrawn.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the view we take of these proceedings, it is not necessary for us to deal
    with the Attorney General’s motion either.  For the reasons that follow,
    we dismiss Ms. Segal’s motion for leave to intervene in the appeal.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Lynch and Mr. Segal lived together from 1994 until August 2001.  They have
    two children, who are currently almost twelve and eight years of age.  Mr.
    Segal ceased paying support in December 2002, and this litigation was commenced
    in July 2003.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Leonor
    Segal and Moses Segal were married for twenty-six years.  The children of
    their marriage are now adults.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Segal has now remarried – to a distant cousin of her first husband who is
    said to be even wealthier than Moses Segal.  Ms. Segal and her present husband
    are highly respected members of the Jewish community in Montreal, well-known
    for their generous charitable works and contributions in that City.  Ms.
    Lynch is aware of this through her continued contacts with another relative
    of Mr. Segal, Phyllis Segal Denaburg, who lives in Toronto, and who attends
    family gatherings with Ms. Segal’s current husband from time to time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    no time prior to June of this year did Ms. Segal take any steps to register
    or enforce her Nevada judgments in Ontario or to intervene in Ms. Lynch’s
    action, although she was well aware of the existence of that action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Lynch deposes that Mr. Segal has long threatened to bring his first wife
    into the picture to usurp any award she might obtain, that he stated he would
    practice a “scorched earth policy” and would rather see anyone take value
    from the properties than Ms. Lynch.  This attitude was confirmed in an e-mail
    to Ms. Lynch, dated December 19, 2005, in which Mr. Segal said: “I think
    it is now time to invite U-NO-WHO from Montreal to the picnic.  She is not
    needy, but is very hungry, will eat a lot, and will never go away.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Segal’s notice of motion for leave to intervene is dated July 17, 2006.  On
    July 18, Mr. Segal sent another e-mail to Ms. Lynch.  It said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>While at the
    shore in my house with my kids give serious consideration to the following: <b>NEMO
    ME IMPUNE LACESSIT</b> [emphasis in e-mail].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Roughly
    translated, “Nemo me impune lacessit” means “No one messes with me and gets
    away with it”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time of the argument of these motions, Ms. Lynch and her children had
    moved from the Province of Ontario and were living in protective custody
    in New Jersey.  The move was prompted, according to Ms. Lynch, when she was
    advised by Toronto Police to move because of concerns for her safety.  There
    is some support for these allegations in police documentation in the record.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is only one inference to be drawn from the foregoing:  Moses Segal – who
    did not participate in the trial or the appeal, and who the appellant corporations
    say is entirely removed from them – is the instigator of this eleventh-hour
    attempt to intervene by Ms. Segal.  Given the trial judge’s findings that
    Mr. Segal is the beneficial owner of the corporations, and indeed, that he
    and the corporations are one and the same – a finding with which we, as previously
    indicated, will not interfere – it is difficult not to conclude that the
    appellants are behind the attempted intervention as well.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    is not to say that Ms. Segal has been treated any better by their former
    spouse than has Ms. Lynch.  His attitude towards each, in relation to his
    support obligations, can only be described as contemptible.  Ms. Segal has
    made numerous – and expensive – unsuccessful attempts to enforce her Nevada
    judgments in the United States.  Everyone acknowledges that the difficulties
    of both spouses arise out of the extraordinary lengths to which Moses Segal
    goes to hide himself and his substantial assets from them, as well as other
    creditors, and his remarkable ability to succeed in doing so.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court’s power to permit a proposed party to intervene is discretionary.  Rule
    13.01 provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>13.01(1) A person
    who is not a party to a proceeding may move for leave to intervene as an
    added party if the person claims,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(a) an interest
    in the subject matter of the proceeding;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(b) that the
    person may be adversely affected by a judgment in the proceeding; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    to the proceeding a question of law or fact in common with one or more of
    the questions in issue in the proceeding.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>         (2)
    On the motion, the court shall consider whether the intervention will unduly
    delay or prejudice the determination of the rights of the parties to the
    proceeding and the court may add the person as a party to the proceeding
    and may make such order as is just.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the Court of Appeal, rule 13.03(2) states that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Leave to intervene
    as an added party ... in the Court of Appeal may be granted by a panel of
    the court, the Chief Justice of Ontario or the Associate Chief Justice of

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='

      (1990), 74 O.R. (2d) 164 at 167 (C.A.) Dubin C.J.O. articulated the test
      to be applied on motions such as this as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Although much
    has been written as to the proper matters to be considered in determining
    whether an application for intervention should be granted, in the end, in
    my opinion, the matters to be considered are the nature of the case, the
    issues which arise and the likelihood of the applicant being able to make
    a useful contribution to the resolution of the appeal without causing injustice
    to the immediate parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    general, however, courts have interpreted the intervention provisions somewhat
    more narrowly in strictly private litigation – the situation here – as opposed
    to the approach taken in public or constitutional litigation.  As Chief Justice
    McMurtry noted, in <i>Authorson (Litigation Guardian of) v. Canada (Attorney
    General)</i>, 9 C.P.C. (5th) 218 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 8:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In contrast,
    Ontario courts have interpreted Rule 13 more narrowly in conventional, non-constitutional
    litigation.  (See for example, <i>Peixeiro v. Haberman</i> (1994), 20 O.R.
    (3d) 666 (Ont. Gen. Div.), at 670.  Intervention of third parties into essentially
    private disputes should be carefully considered as any intervention can add
    to the costs and complexity of litigation, regardless of an agreement to
    restrict submissions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    had Ms. Segal registered her Nevada judgments in Ontario prior to the trial
    and applied for intervention status at that stage, it may well be she would
    have succeeded, at least with respect to the issues concerning the ownership
    of the appellant corporations and their properties, and the matter of the
    vesting order.  As a registered spousal judgment creditor entitled to equal
    priority with Ms. Lynch over Moses Segal’s property, she could be said to
    have an interest in those subject matters and to be a person who may be adversely
    affected by a judgment in relation to them.  On Ms. Segal’s behalf, Mr. Zacher
    submits that the same considerations apply on appeal and that Ms. Segal acted
    as soon as she became aware of the appeal and of the fact that someone had
    finally located some exigible assets that can be affixed to Mr. Segal.</p>

    our view, however, more than those factors must be taken into account in
    the exercise of our discretion whether to grant Ms. Segal leave to intervene
    at this stage of the proceedings.  We are directed by rule 13.01(2) to “consider
    whether the intervention <i>will unduly delay or prejudice the determination
    of the rights of the parties</i> to the proceedings”, and, as Dubin C.J.O.
    noted in <i>Peel</i>, <i>supra</i>, we must also weigh “the likelihood of
    the applicant being able to make a useful contribution to the resolution
    of the appeal <i>without causing injustice to the immediate parties</i>.”</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, it would be unfair and unjust to permit Ms. Segal to intervene
    at this stage of the appeal because it would unduly delay and prejudice Ms.
    Lynch’s rights on the appeal, and because we do not believe that the utility
    of any contribution her submissions might make to the resolution of the appeal
    outweigh the injustice that would prevail if she were allowed to intervene
    in the circumstances.  We decline to exercise our discretion in favour of
    making such an order.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court is empowered, under ss. 9(1)(d)(i) and 34(1)(c ) of the <i>Family Law
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3, to grant a vesting order for the equalization
    of net family property or for the provision of child or spousal support.  There
    is no requirement under the FLA for notice to be given to anyone in particular
    when such an order is sought.  We are not aware of any other statutory or
    legal prerequisite that would require Ms. Lynch to give notice of the details
    of her claim to Ms. Segal nor were we referred to any such authority by counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fact that Ms. Segal’s attempted intervention was instigated by Moses Segal
    for his own undoubtedly invidious motivations –
    notwithstanding we are to believe he is completely unconnected with the appeal
    – and the circumstances surrounding the intervention as outlined above, are
    relevant to the exercise of this discretion.  By themselves they may be insufficient
    to ground an order refusing leave to intervene.  However, they are not by
    themselves on this record, and they do form the context from which the intervention
    motion cannot be divorced.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Segal has known about Ms. Lynch’s action almost since its inception in 2003.  Indeed,
    with Ms. Segal’s indirect permission,<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a> Ms.
    Lynch spoke with Ms. Segal’s Nevada lawyer, Mr. Jimmerson, about their respective
    lawsuits.  While it does not appear that they discussed, specifically, the
    fact that Ms. Lynch was seeking an interest in corporations and properties
    alleged to be owned beneficially by Mr. Segal, the notes of her conversation
    indicate that reference was made to foreign jurisdictions such as Bahamas,
    Turks &amp; Caicos, Switzerland, Jersey, Guernsey and Mauritius.  Guernsey,
    of course, is the jurisdiction where the purported secret trust investors
    in the appellant corporations were said to be based.  In addition, it is
    clear that Ms. Lynch and Mr. Jimmerson talked about Ms. Segal’s right to
    register and enforce her Nevada judgments in Ontario (Ms. Lynch told him
    about the Family Responsibility Office and the steps it would take on a spouse’s
    behalf to enforce judgments) and about why Ms. Segal had never asserted her
    claim against Mr. Segal in Canada (Mr. Jimmerson said that Ms. Segal was
    concerned she would have to allow visitation to her then minor son, Zachary,
    in exchange, which she was not prepared to do).  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the circumstances, it appears to us that following this conversation, it
    was open to Ms. Lynch to proceed on the assumption that Ms. Segal was not
    interested in pursuing any claim against Mr. Segal in Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the same time, Ms. Segal had ample knowledge of Ms. Lynch’s lawsuit to permit
    her to make inquiries and to initiate proceedings in Ontario to protect her
    interests vis-à-vis Ms. Lynch’s claims, had she any desire to do so.  She
    obviously has access to good legal advice, and a simple and inexpensive search
    of the public record would have revealed the full nature of the claim being
    pursued by Ms. Lynch.  She did not avail herself of either option.  She could
    have registered her Nevada judgments under the <i>Act</i> and taken steps
    to enforce them here at any time.  She did not do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    between Ms. Lynch and Ms. Segal, their treatment at the hands of Mr. Segal
    has been equally tawdry, but the equities as to their personal positions,
    on the record, favour Ms. Lynch.  Ms. Lynch is in difficult financial circumstances,
    needing financial support for herself and her two pre-teen children, and
    having received nothing from Mr. Segal.  Ms. Segal is in the same situation
    as far as the non-receipt of support and the non-satisfaction of her judgments
    is concerned, but the similarity ends there.  Ms. Segal has remarried.  Her
    children are adults and at least one of them is a successful business man.  Her
    second husband – a distant relative of Mr. Segal – is even wealthier than
    Mr. Segal is.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    Ms. Segal’s intervention would undoubtedly complicate and protract the present
    appeal, which has already been well and fully argued.   The existence of
    her Nevada judgments, and their significance in relation to the granting
    of an order vesting the properties in Ms. Lynch, formed part of the substance
    of those arguments.  In such circumstances, we are not able to say that the
    likelihood of Ms. Segal being able to make a useful contribution to the resolution
    of the appeal on its merits outweighs the injustice that would be worked
    on Ms. Lynch if she were permitted to intervene.</p>
