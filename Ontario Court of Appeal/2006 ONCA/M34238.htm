      judgment had not been satisfied when Mr. Di Paola went bankrupt in 2001.  He
      was discharged from bankruptcy in 2002.  In 2006, Participative brought
      a motion claiming that its judgment survived Mr. Di Paola’s discharge by

      1985, c. B-3 (“<i>BIA</i>”).  Ground J. dismissed the motion holding that
      the breach of fiduciary duty underlying the 1994 judgment was not the kind
      of breach that would cause the debt to survive Mr. Di Paola’s discharge
      from bankruptcy.  </span></p>

      for Mr. Di Paola relies primarily on rule 61.06(1)(b).  It provides that
      a judge of the Court of Appeal may make an order for security for costs
      where that order “could be made against the appellant under rule 56.01.”  Broadly
      speaking, rule 56.01 governs the making of security for costs orders in
      the trial court.  Counsel for Mr. Di Paola relies on 56.01(1)(d) which
      states:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The court, <u>on
      motion by the defendant or respondent in a proceeding,</u> may make such

      who was a defendant/respondent in the proceedings in which the appeal is
      taken may, if the criteria set out in rule 56.01 are met, obtain an order
      of costs against an appellant who was a plaintiff/applicant in the proceedings
      in which the appeal is taken:  see <i>Toronto Dominion Bank v. Szilagyi

      for Participative submits that rule 56.01 only applies to orders made “in
      a proceeding” and not to orders made on a motion brought in a proceeding.  Counsel
      submits that the order of Ground J. was made on a motion and was not an
      order made in a proceeding.   </span></p>

      Ltd.</i> (1986), 56 O.R. (2d) 480 (L.J.S.C.) and <i>Société Sepic S.A.
      v. Aga Stone Ltd.</i> (1995), 21 O.R. (3d) 542 (Osborne J.A. in chambers).  <i>Société
    Sepic S.A.</i> does not assist Participative.  Osborne J.A. held that rule
    61.06(1), by its terms, applied to “appeals”
    and not to applications for leave to appeal.  He held that the distinction
    between an appeal and an application for leave to appeal was well understood
    and could not be ignored when interpreting the language of rule 61.06.  His
    analysis is not germane to the issue raised on this motion.  </span></p>

        Investments Ltd.</span></i><span
lang=EN-US> does support Participative’s position.  If I understand that judgment
        correctly, it draws a distinction between motions that commence a proceeding
        and are, therefore by definition, applications, and motions brought in
        the course of proceedings that have been commenced by action or application.  <i>Buffer
        Investments Ltd.</i> holds that a motion brought in a proceeding cannot
        be the basis for a security for costs order made under rule 56.01.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      cannot agree with the distinction drawn in <i>Buffer Investments Ltd.  </i>I
      think rule 56.01 speaks to proceedings without qualification.  A motion
      brought in the course of a proceeding is as much a part of that proceeding
      as any other step in the process.  A party who is a defendant or a respondent
      in a proceeding does not lose that status because a motion is brought in
      the proceeding.  Similarly, the plaintiff or applicant in the proceeding
      remains a plaintiff or applicant even when a motion is brought.  Rule 56.01
      looks to the status of the parties in the proceeding.  In my view, it permits
      defendants/respondents in the underlying proceeding to move for security
      for costs.  Rule 56.01 does not exclude a defendant/respondent in a proceeding
      from seeking security for costs in a motion brought in the course of the
      proceedings.  In so holding, I do not suggest that rule 56.01 is the only
      avenue by which a defendant/respondent on a motion may obtain security
      for costs.  Motion judges have a broad discretion to impose appropriate
      terms when granting relief on motions.  In some situations, an order for
      security for costs will be an appropriate term on which the relief sought
      by the moving party on the motion is granted.    </span></p>

      rejection of the distinction drawn in <i>Buffer Investments Ltd.</i> does
      not, of course, compel the conclusion that rule 56.01 is available to Mr.
      Di Paola in these circumstances.  Counsel for Mr. Di Paola referred me
      to <i>R. v. M.K.M. Manufacturing Ltd.</i> (2003), 48 C.B.R. (4<sup>th</sup>)
      222 (B.C.C.A. Chambers).  That case did not involve a motion for security
      for costs pending appeal.  Levine J.A. made an order for security for costs
      in an appeal taken in a bankruptcy matter.  However, she made that order
      as a term of granting an extension of time within which to bring an appeal.  Appeal
      courts have a broad discretion to impose terms when granting an extension
      of time.  <i>R. v. M.K.M. Manufacturing Ltd.</i> does not assist me in
      interpreting the security for costs provisions in the <i>Ontario Rules
      of Civil Procedure</i>.</span></p>

      the language of rule 56.01 is not tailor made for the circumstances of
      this case.  The proceeding for the purpose of rule 56.01 is the bankruptcy
      proceeding.  Mr. Di Paola, who seeks the order, is not a defendant/respondent
      in those proceedings.  Similarly, Participative, against whom the security
      for costs order is sought,  is not a plaintiff/applicant in the bankruptcy
      proceeding.  </span></p>

      similar problem arose in <i>Re Fabricut Limited</i> (1985), 52 C.B.R. 84
      (Ont. Sup. Ct.).  A trustee in bankruptcy moved for an order for the interim
      preservation of property in an ongoing bankruptcy.  The trustee relied
      on rule 45.01(1) that applied to property that was relevant to an issue
      in “a proceeding.”  It was argued that the motion brought by the trustee
      in the bankruptcy proceedings for a preservation order was not “a proceeding.”  </span></p>

      held that the motion brought by the trustee was sufficiently akin to an
      action as defined in the rules to justify analogizing the trustee’s motion
      to an action thereby bringing it within the definition of proceeding.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      think Participative’s motion is sufficiently analogous to an action to
      warrant treating that motion brought in the bankruptcy proceedings as a
      discrete proceeding for the purposes of rule 56.01.  Participative, like
      a plaintiff, has initiated a proceeding in which it seeks an order permitting
      it to enforce a money judgment against Mr. Di Paola.  Like a defendant
      in an action, Mr. Di Paola has been brought into court by Participative
      and is required to defend himself against the claim.  Rule 56.01(d) is
      designed to afford some protection against the costs of defending against
      claims initiated by corporations who are immune to any costs consequences
      of the lawsuit because they have no assets in the province.  That policy
      is at much in play on this motion as it would have been had Participative
      brought an action on the judgment.  </span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The proper procedure

      would follow the lead of McKinlay J. and analogize the motion brought by
      Participative to an action and hold that for the purposes of rule 56.01
      it is a proceeding.  Once the analogy is made, the application of rule
      56.01 becomes straightforward.  Mr. Di Paola is a respondent and Participative
      is an applicant. </span></p>

      concedes that it has no assets.  Given that concession, it falls to Participative
      to show why it should be permitted to proceed without providing security
      for costs.  If I understand Participative’s position correctly, it asserts
      it is impecunious and that any order for security for costs will effectively
      end its appeal.  Implicit in this submission is the claim that Mr. Di Paola
      is at least partially responsible for Participative’s impecuniosity.  </span></p>

      me, however, of what assets Participative may have available to it to fund
      its appeal.  Presumably, its appeal is being funded by some source outside
      of the company.  I am not prepared to assume that Participative could not
      gain access to sufficient assets to comply with a security for costs order
      that I might make.  The availability of those assets may turn on a careful
      assessment on the merits of the appeal by the putative funder of the appeal.  As
