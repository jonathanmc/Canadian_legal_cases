line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is an application for leave to appeal and if leave is granted, an appeal
    from an order made by the motion judge in ongoing proceedings under the <i>Companies’ Creditors
    Arrangement Act</i> (“<i>CCAA</i>”).  The motion for leave and the appeal
    itself were ordered heard together by Borins J.A.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is well established that leave to appeal from orders made in ongoing <i>CCAA</i> proceedings
    will be granted “sparingly”.  This is particularly true where the order under
    attack is a discretionary order: see <i>Re Stelco Inc.</i> (2005), 254 D.L.R.
    (4<sup>th</sup>) 109 (Ont. C.A.).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the applicants/appellants accepts, correctly in our view, that the order
    under appeal was made in the exercise of the motion judge’s discretion under
    the <i>CCAA</i>.  Counsel argues that the motion judge erred in the exercise
    of her discretion by taking into account two irrelevant considerations and
    by giving undue weight to a relevant consideration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents concede that the relief sought by the applicants/appellants before
    the motion judge was available under the <i>CCAA</i> and that in an appropriate
    case, the order sought could have been made.  They argue that the motion
    judge found that this was not an appropriate case for the order sought and
    that there is no reason to doubt the exercise of that discretion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    arguments advanced by counsel demonstrate the very fact-specific nature of
    the motion judge’s exercise of her discretion.  Her order is very much a
    product of her assessment of the fact situation before her.  It does not
    purport to determine any legal issues of significance outside of the factual
    corners of this proceeding.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicants/appellants argue that the motion judge should not have taken into
    consideration the fact that any motion to certify the proposed class action
    proceedings would have to take place in the United States and not in Canada.  Counsel
    submits that the location of the proceeding is irrelevant.  In our view,
    the forum in which any future class certification proceedings might occur
    was relevant as one factor in the broader assessment of the nature and extent
    to which the ongoing <i>CCAA</i> proceedings could be delayed or lengthened
    were the applicants/appellants allowed leave to file a representative claim
    on behalf of the as yet uncertified classes.  The impact of the requested
    order on the <i>CCAA </i>proceedings is clearly a relevant consideration.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicants/appellants next submit that the motion judge was wrong to take
    into consideration the absence of any individual claims in the <i>CCAA</i> proceedings
    by those individuals who are part of the groups on whose behalf the applicants/appellants
    seek to advance a representative claim.  Given the nature of the individual
    claims underlying the proposed class action, we think that it was open to
    the motion judge to view the absence of any individual claims as suggesting
    that these claims were neither strong nor financially significant.  The nature
    of the proposed claims is clearly a relevant consideration in the exercise
    of the motion judge’s discretion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the applicants/appellants submit that the motion judge gave undue weight
    to the applicant/appellant’s failure to apply for the order before the claims
    bar date set out in the earlier order of Farley J.  The essence of the motion
    judge’s reasoning is found at paras. 42-44 of her reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[H]ere, a structure
    was established by court order, on notice to the very parties who now wish
    to alter the process fundamentally, after all stakeholders have relied on
    the structure that was established.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[43]  Changing
    and increasing the landscape of claimants after the settlement of 30 of the
    ephedra claims after the claims bar date could cause prejudice to the eventual
    success of the CCAA process.  Simply put, all the arguments made by the Representative
    Plaintiffs and California Consumers should have been made before Farley J.
    when the Call for Claims order was made, or earlier motions should have been
    made to deal with these issues before the Call for Claims order was even
    made.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[44]  The process
    gave adequate opportunity for anyone with a claim to file a proof of claim.  The
    forms were accessible, in plain English.  The products liability claimants
    all managed to make individual claims, even though they might have been involved
    in class actions.  No other prohormone claimants have filed a proof of claim.  To
    allow representative or class claims at this date would be prejudicial to
    the entire claims process, and would impair the integrity of the CCAA process
    here.  I decline to exercise my discretion in these circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    factors were, in our view, properly considered by the motion judge in the
    exercise of her discretion.  The weight to be assigned to these various factors
    was a matter for the motion judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ultimately,
    we see no realistic possibility of success were we to grant leave to appeal.  These
    proposed representative claims appear individually very modest.  They are
    at a very early stage whereas the claims in the <i>CCAA</i> proceeding appear
    to be nearing final resolution.  These factors all tell strongly in favour
    of the disposition made by the motion judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Leave
    to appeal is refused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    think this is an appropriate case for costs.  Costs to Mr. Myers’ clients
    in the amount of $10,000.  Costs to Mr. Mark’s clients in the amount of $5,000.  Costs
    are inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
