  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is an application brought on behalf of Mr. Boyle
    pursuant to section 680 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>seeking an order directing
    a review of the detention order made by the Honourable Justice Charbonneau on
    April 10, 2006.  Given that the charges
    involve murder and attempted murder, the onus was upon the applicant to show
    cause why he could be released.  The
    learned judge found that the applicant had not met that onus in respect of the
    &quot;secondary ground&quot; set out in section 515(10) of the <i>Code</i>.  In the circumstances it was unnecessary for
    him to consider the tertiary grounds for detention.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am satisfied that on the basis of the material before
    him, the learned judge was justified in ordering the detention of the
    applicant.  He was fully cognizant of the
    nature of the evidence to be adduced at trial and considered that while the
    case for the prosecution appeared to be strong, it was open to challenge given
    the circumstances surrounding the two primary crown witnesses. The evidence
    before him depicted a crime of extreme violence and one of remarkable
    ruthlessness, given that the evidence suggested that at least part of the
    motivation for the murders and attempted murder was the elimination of
    witnesses.  Given the evidentiary record
    at the bail hearing, I am satisfied that there is no realistic likelihood that
    a panel of this court would find the judge erred in detaining the applicant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the applicant also sought to introduce
    additional evidence, which he submitted, undercut the strength of the crown's
    case.  The position of the crown was that
    if counsel for the defence wishes to put forward a material change, he is
    obliged to renew the application before the Superior Court.  There is ample authority for this proposition,
    although I am not prepared to rule that there are no circumstances under which
    an appellate court might consider fresh evidence on such a review.  However, there is considerable common sense
    in returning to the originating court, creating an evidentiary record and
    obtaining the views of a judge of first instance on the impact of the new or
    changed information on the issue of interim release.  Such a procedure would create the necessary
    record for further review, if appropriate, by this court.  Counsel have advised that the preliminary
    inquiry in this matter is scheduled to commence within a few weeks, when this
    evidence and the evidence of the two primary witnesses will no doubt be
    examined extensively.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances, I am of the view that this motion
    should be dismissed without prejudice to counsel for the applicant renewing the
    bail application in the Superior Court and without prejudice to counsel
    applying again before me at a later date, if appropriate.</p>
