  <h2>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1983, Sue Kalbfleisch and Andy Kalbfleisch formed Atec
    Marketing Limited, an Ontario company that produces jump ropes.  Atec supplied jump ropes to the Heart and Stroke
    Foundation of Canada and its provincial arm, the Heart and Stroke Foundation of
    Ontario (the “Foundation”) for use in a fundraising program called “Jump Rope
    for Heart” (the “Program”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Atec was the exclusive supplier of jump ropes and associated
    educational materials to the Foundation for nineteen years.  During that time, Atec worked closely with
    the Foundation to promote the Program.  The Kalbfleischs devoted significant time, effort and resources to help
    “grow” the Program.  Among other things,
    they: sponsored elite skipping events; carried out an advertising campaign for
    the Program in the print media; placed the Program logo on Atec’s retail
    product packaging to promote the Program; produced a videotape to promote the
    Program that was supplied to the Foundation at cost; and, made many donations
    of various types.  Sue Kalbfleisch was
    also a coach, workshop leader and guideline author for the Foundation’s
    demonstration teams that visited schools to demonstrate techniques and promote
    the Program.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the Foundation ended its relationship with Atec in 2002
    because a new and cheaper supplier of jump ropes had been found, Atec
    sued.  It claimed that the nature of its
    relationship with the Foundation was such that it was entitled to reasonable
    notice of termination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a judgment dated September 30, 2005, Harris&nbsp;J.
    dismissed Atec’s claim.  The trial judge
    found that the relationship was not such that Atec was entitled to notice prior
    to termination.  Further, he found that
    even if the relationship created such an obligation, the Foundation had grounds
    on which to terminate the relationship without notice.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Atec appeals.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge gave three reasons for holding that the
    Foundation was entitled to terminate its relationship with Atec without notice.  These reasons are summarised in
    para.&nbsp;54 of the reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[54] After
    Heart and Stroke appointed a new National Director the representatives of Atec
    became increasingly difficult to work with.&nbsp; They attempted to dominate
    and control an organization that was not theirs.&nbsp; They published a report
    that had the tone of a superior who was chastising an employee who had made a
    serious mistake.&nbsp; And most importantly, Atec refused to reduce its
    artificially inflated and uncompetitive price.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Earlier in the reasons, the trial judge made findings that
    support these conclusions.  Paragraphs
    19 and 25&#8209;27 of the reasons are significant in this respect.  Those paragraphs are set out below:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[19] During
    his testimony, Andy Kalbfleisch conceded that he had chosen to focus primarily
    on becoming an industrial supplier rather than a retail supplier.&nbsp; It also
    was revealed at trial that after the completion of this non-competition
    agreement, and unbeknownst to the Defendant, Atec charged a hidden premium on
    each rope it sold to the Defendant to compensate itself for the lost school
    market.&nbsp; For purposes of context the Defendant was purchasing upwards of
    400,000 skip ropes annually.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[25] Atec
    perceived Heart and Stroke to be moving the Jump program away from its skipping
    ropes and fitness, towards a fundraising focus.&nbsp; In an effort to deter
    this change, Atec unilaterally prepared and published a report on youth
    fitness.&nbsp; The report was critical of the decline of the Jump program and
    the concurrent decline in youth fitness across Canada.&nbsp; It was written in
    an overbearing, demanding and harsh tone. Also the report was distributed to a
    list of recipients unilaterally determined by Atec including some outside the
    Defendant’s organization. All in all it was an intrusion by a supplier into its
    customer’s policies the likely purpose of which was to increase skipping rope
    sales.<b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>It comes as no surprise that this report did not sit
    well with Heart and Stroke.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[26] From the
    evidence that I have heard regarding the falling out between the parties, it is
    clear that the belligerent, overbearing and presumptuous attitude of Andy and
    Sue at Atec was the singular cause.&nbsp; The stability and harmony of the past
    had instilled a false sense of importance in Andy and Sue Kalbfleish.&nbsp;
    They sought to run the Jump program regardless of the fact they were merely a
    supplier of skipping ropes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[27] Also
    during this time, Atec was asked to reduce the prices of its skipping
    ropes.&nbsp; When it refused to do so, Heart and Stroke found a more
    competitive supplier.&nbsp; In March of 2002 Atec was informed of this
    decision.&nbsp; Heart and Stroke notified Atec that it would not be the sole
    supplier of skipping ropes, but would be allowed to provide a quote along with
    other suppliers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While it is arguable that the trial judge’s description of the
    report is unduly harsh, we are satisfied that he was entitled to make the
    balance of the findings and, thus, to conclude that the Foundation was entitled
    to terminate the relationship without notice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of this conclusion, it is unnecessary to consider
    Atec’s argument that the relationship between it and the Foundation is of an
    intermediate nature such that a requirement for reasonable notice of
    termination may be implied.  See <i>1193430 Ontario Inc. v. Boa-Franc Inc</i>.
    (2005), 78 O.R. (3d) 81 (C.A.); leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, 31276 (April
    13, 2006).  It is unnecessary, as well,
    to decide whether the trial judge correctly applied the law in concluding that
    the relationship was not one of permanence, exclusivity or dependence.       </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs to the
    respondent fixed at $5,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
