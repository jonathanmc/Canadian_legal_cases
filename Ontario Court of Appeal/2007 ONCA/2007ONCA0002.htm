  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Five-year-old D.D. has three parents:  his biological father and mother (B.B. and
    C.C., respectively) and C.C.’s partner, the appellant A.A.  A.A. and C.C. have been in a stable same-sex
    union since 1990.  In 1999, they decided
    to start a family with the assistance of their friend B.B.  The two women would be the primary
    caregivers of the child, but they believed it would be in the child’s best
    interests that B.B. remain involved in the child’s life.  D.D. was born in 2001.  He refers to A.A. and C.C. as his
    mothers.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2003, A.A. applied to Aston J. for a declaration that, like
    B.B. and C.C., she was D.D.’s parent, specifically his mother.  Had he thought he had jurisdiction, Aston J.
    would have made that declaration.  He found
    at para. 8 that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
class=loose><span lang=EN>The child is a bright,
    healthy, happy individual who is obviously thriving in a loving family that
    meets his every need. The applicant has been a daily and consistent presence in
    his life. She is fully committed to a parental role. She has the support of the
    two biological parents who themselves recognize her equal status with them.</span></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the application judge found that he did not have
    jurisdiction to make the declaration sought, either under the <i>Children’s Law Reform Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. C.12 [the <i>CLRA</i>] or through
    exercise of the court’s inherent <i>parens
    patriae</i> jurisdiction.  He therefore
    dismissed the application.  No
    constitutional argument was made before him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal to this court, the appellant repeats the same
    arguments as those made before the application judge.  For the first time, she also raises constitutional issues
    alleging violation of her rights to equality and fundamental justice under ss.
    15 and 7 of the <i>Canadian Charter of
    Rights and Freedoms.</i>  The appellant
    is supported by B.B., C.C. and various intervenors, including the Children’s
    Lawyer<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a> acting on behalf of D.D.,  and the
    applicants from <i>M.D.R. v. Ontario (Deputy
    Registrar General)</i>, [2006] O.J. No. 2268 (S.C.J.), a case that raised
    related issues.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Alliance for Marriage and Family, a coalition of five
    public interest organizations, was permitted to intervene.  The Alliance submits that the application
    judge properly dismissed the application, that the <i>CLRA</i> is not capable
    of being interpreted to permit a declaration that a child has two mothers, and
    that the <i>parens patriae</i> jurisdiction
    is not available.  The Alliance also
    submits that this court should not entertain the <i>Charter</i> arguments and that, in any event, the <i>CLRA</i> is not
    unconstitutional.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Attorney General for Ontario has chosen not to intervene
    to support the legislation. In these circumstances, the court appointed Mr.
    Thomas G. Bastedo, Q.C. as <i>amicus curiae</i>.  Mr. Bastedo submits that the application
    judge properly interpreted the <i>CLRA</i>.  He submits, however, that the court should make the declaration sought
    under its <i>parens patriae</i> jurisdiction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the following reasons, I would allow the appeal.  While I agree with the application judge
    that the <i>CLRA </i>does not permit the
    making of the order sought, I am satisfied that the order can be made by
    exercising this court’s <i>parens patriae</i> jurisdiction.  Because they were not
    raised before the application judge, I would decline to deal with the <i>Charter</i> issues.  I will deal with this latter issue first.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 16, 2005, McMurtry C.J.O. granted leave to the
    appellant to file a supplementary factum and amended Notice of Appeal to “deal
    with Charter issues”.  Whether this
    court should decide the <i>Charter </i>issues,
    however, is a matter for the panel hearing the appeal.  In her appeal, A.A. submits that her rights
    under ss. 7 and 15 of the <i>Charter</i> were infringed.  A.A. did not file any
    additional material in support of these arguments.  She submits that the material filed before the application judge
    is sufficient to allow this court to undertake a <i>Charter </i>analysis.  Further, any deficiency in the record is
    cured by reference to the record from <i>M.D.R.
    v. Ontario (Deputy Registrar General)</i>.  That record was placed before this court as part of the order granting
    M.D.R. intervenor status on this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>L’Heureux-Dubé J. in her dissenting opinion in <i>R. v. Brown</i> (1993), 83 C.C.C. (3d) 129
    (S.C.C.) at 133-4, set down three prerequisites for when a court will permit a
    party to raise a <i>Charter </i>issue for
    the first time on appeal.  In <i>R. v. R. (R.)</i> (1994), 91 C.C.C. (3d) 193
    (Ont. C.A.) this court accepted that, while L’Heureux-Dubé J. was speaking in
    dissent, the majority did not take issue with this part of her reasons for
    judgment.  The three prerequisites were
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>First, there
    must be a sufficient evidentiary record to resolve the issue. Secondly, it must
    not be an instance in which the accused for tactical reasons failed to raise
    the issue at trial. Thirdly, the court must be satisfied that no miscarriage of
    justice will result from the refusal to raise such new issue on appeal (<i>Brown</i>,
    p. 136). </p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>I note
    that the onus is on the party seeking to raise the <i>Charter </i>issue to demonstrate that they meet these requirements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have some concern that the appellant cannot meet the first
    prerequisite in view of the comments of the majority of the Supreme Court of
    Canada in <i>Hy and Zel’s Inc. v. Ontario
    (Attorney General)</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 675 at 694: “<span class=loose><span
lang=EN>In the absence of facts specific to the
    appellants, both the Court's ability to ensure that it hears from those most
    directly affected and that <i>Charter</i> issues are decided in a proper
    factual context are compromised.”  In </span></span><i>Hy and Zel’s Inc.</i> the appellants sought
    to rely on a record filed in another case raising identical issues.  A.A. similarly seeks to rely upon the <i>M.D.R. </i>record to supplement the record
    in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, I need not decide whether there is a sufficient
    evidentiary record because the appellant has not met the second prerequisite by
    showing that she did not raise the <i>Charter</i> issues for tactical reasons.  Before the
    application judge there was no party, including the Attorney General, opposing
    the application for a declaration under the Act.  Since no <i>Charter</i> issues
    were raised, the application judge refused to permit the Alliance to intervene
    to oppose the application.  It would
    seem that the appellant wished to take advantage of the obvious tactical
    advantage of proceeding with an unopposed application. The appellant has not
    advanced any explanation in this court for not advancing the <i>Charter</i> issues at first instance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellant does not meet the third prerequisite
    set out in <i>Brown. </i> I have
    concluded that this court’s <i>parens
    patriae</i> jurisdiction is available to give the appellant the remedy she
    seeks.  Therefore, no miscarriage of
    justice will ensue to these litigants if this court does not decide the <i>Charter </i>issues.  In the result, I would
    decline to address the <i>Charter </i>issues in this case.  The <i>Charter</i> claims under ss. 7 and 15, which would have broad implications beyond the facts
    of this particular case, can be dealt with in another case on the basis of a
    proper record.</p>

    parent by reason of s. 158(2) of the <i>Child
    and Family Services Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.11.  That section provides: “For all purposes of law, as of the date
    of the making of an adoption order … (b) the adopted child ceases to be the
    child of the person who was his or her parent before the adoption order was
    made and that person ceases to be the parent of the adopted child, except where

    the death of the birth mother.  Without
    a declaration of parentage or some other order, the surviving partner would be
    unable to make decisions for their minor child, such as critical decisions
    about health care: see <i>M.D.R.</i> at
    para. 220.  As the M.D.R. Intervenors
    say:  “A declaration of parentage
    provides practical and symbolic recognition of the parent-child
    relationship.”  An excerpt from the <i>M.D.R</i>. record dramatically demonstrates
    the importance of the declaration from the child’s point of view.  I resort to this part of the <i>M.D.R.</i> record because D.D. is too young
    to provide this kind of information.  The twelve-year old child of one of the applicants said this in her

    she is unable to produce evidence of her relationship to the child unless she
    has taken steps to obtain a Family Court parenting order or some form of

    by children born outside of marriage.  As the Ontario Law Reform Commission observed in its 1973 Report on
    Family Law at p. 1:  “These disabilities
    arise at the moment of birth and may remain with the child throughout his
    lifetime.”  The Commission therefore
    “accorded high priority to finding a means by which the child born outside
    marriage may be allowed to enjoy the same rights and privileges as other children
    in our society”.  The Commission’s
    central recommendation was that Ontario should abolish the concepts of
    legitimacy and illegitimacy and declare positively that all children have equal
    status in law.  The Commission’s
    recommendations were enacted into legislation in the form of Parts I
    and&nbsp;II of the <i>CLRA</i>.  The
    Commission’s central recommendation concerning equality of children is found in
    the Act’s first section:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><a name="1.(1)"><span

    product of its time.  It was intended to
    deal with the specific problem of the incidents of illegitimacy – the need to
    “remove, as far as the law is capable of doing so, a stigma which has been cast
    on children who in the nature of things cannot be said to bear responsibility for
    it” (p. 11).  The possibility of legally
    and socially recognized same-sex unions and the implications of advances in
    reproductive technology were not on the radar scheme.  The Act does not deal with, nor contemplate, the disadvantages
    that a child born into a relationship of two mothers, two fathers or as in this
    case two mothers and one father might suffer.  This is not surprising given that nothing in the Commission’s report
    suggests that it contemplated that such relationships might even exist.</p>

    the relationship between the various provisions in Parts I and II, it is
    apparent that the Act contemplates only one mother and one father.  The application judge drew attention to many
    of these provisions.  He referred in
    particular to s. 8, which deals with the presumption of paternity.  He was of the view that this section
    contemplated only one father.  This view
    of the legislation is also consistent with the adoption provisions in the Act whereby
    no more than two persons can apply for an adoption order and the order
    extinguishes other parental status.  I
    agree with that interpretation of the legislation.  </p>

    this jurisdiction on several occasions, in particular in <span class=loose><i><span lang=EN>Beson

class=loose><span lang=EN>,
    [1982] 2 S.C.R. 716</span></span><span class=loose><span lang=EN> and <i>E. (</i><i>Mrs) v.

    impact of changing social conditions and the weight of opinion</i> ....&quot;
    In other words, the categories under which the jurisdiction can be exercised
    are never closed. Thus I agree with Latey J. in <i>Re X, supra</i>, at p. 699, that the <i>jurisdiction is of a very broad
    nature</i>, and that it can be invoked in such matters as custody, protection
    of property, health problems, religious upbringing and protection against

    the <i>parens patriae</i> jurisdiction and
    the broader discretion under the impact of changing social conditions are
    particularly apt in this case.  However, <i>Eve</i> concerned the court’s
    jurisdiction to authorize a medical procedure.  It was not principally concerned with the court’s jurisdiction to fill a
    legislative gap.  A case somewhat closer
    to the problem at hand is the Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Beson.</i>  In that case, the
    Director of Child Welfare for Newfoundland removed a child from an adoptive
    home shortly before the expiration of the probationary residence period
    required for an adoption.  The
    legislation did not give the potential adoptive parents any right of appeal
    from the Director’s action taken during the probationary period.  Speaking for the court, Wilson J. found that
    there was accordingly a legislative gap that could be filled by the exercise of
    the <i>parens patriae</i> jurisdiction.  She adopted the following statement from the
    reasons of Lord Wilberforce in <span class=loose><i><span lang=EN>A. v. Liverpool City Council

    a view to action by the court. <i>The

    complete code and, in particular, whether it was intended to confine
    declarations of parentage to biological or genetic relationships.  If the <i>CLRA </i>was intended to be
    confined to declarations of parentage based on biology or genetics, it would be
    difficult to find that there is a legislative gap, at least as concerns persons
    with no genetic or biological link to the child.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As discussed above, the application judge was of the view that
    the jurisdiction to make parentage declarations is not confined to biological
    or genetic relationships.  The Alliance
    for Marriage and Family challenges that proposition.  The Alliance points out that s. 1(1) of the <i>CLRA </i>refers to
    a person being the child of his or her “natural parents”.  I agree that the Act favours biological
    parents.  For example, s. 10 gives a
    court power to order blood tests or DNA tests where it is called upon to
    determine a child’s parentage.  However,
    the Act does not define parentage solely on the basis of biology.  For example, s. 1(2) treats adopting parents
    as natural parents.  Often one or both
    of the adopting parents will not be the biological parents of the child.  Similarly, s. 8 enacts presumptions of
    paternity that do not all turn upon biology; the obvious example is the
    presumption of paternity flowing simply from the fact that the father was
    married to the child’s mother at the time of birth.  Further, as Ferrier J. pointed out in <i>T.D.L. v. L.R.L.</i>, [1994] O.J. No. 896 (S.C.J.) at para. 18, the
    declaration made under s. 4(1) is not that the applicant is a child’s natural
    parent, but that he or she is recognized in law to be the father or mother of
    the child.</p>

    declarations of paternity and maternity to biological parents, that would not
    answer the question of whether there is a gap.  Advances in reproductive technology require re-examination of the most
    basic questions of who is a biological mother.  For example, consider the facts of <i>M.D.R.
    v. Ontario (Deputy Registrar General)</i>.  <i>M.D.R.</i> involved a case where
    one lesbian partner was the gestational or birth mother and the other partner
    was the biological mother, having been the donor of the egg.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I return to the earlier discussion of the intention of the <i>CLRA</i>.  The legislation was not about the status of
    natural parents but the status of children.  The purpose of the legislation was to declare that all children should
    have equal status.  At the time,
    equality of status meant recognizing the equality of children born inside and
    outside of marriage. The Legislature had in mind traditional unions between one
    mother and one father.  It did not legislate
    in relation to other types of relationships because those relationships and the
    advent of reproductive technology were beyond the vision of the Law Reform
    Commission and the Legislature of the day.  As MacKinnon A.C.J.O. said in <i>Re
    Bararic and Juric et al.</i> (1984), 44 O.R. (2d) 638 (C.A.) at :  “The Legislature recognized by this
    legislation present social conditions and attitudes as well as recognizing that
    such declarations have significance beyond material ones.”</p>

line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Present social conditions and attitudes have changed.  Advances in our appreciation of the value of
    other types of relationships and in the science of reproductive technology have
    created gaps in the <i>CLRA</i>’s legislative scheme.  Because of these changes the parents of a child can be two women
    or two men.  They are as much the
    child’s parents as adopting parents or “natural” parents.  The <i>CLRA</i>, however, does not recognize
    these forms of parenting and thus the children of these relationships are
    deprived of the equality of status that declarations of parentage provide.</p>

    deprived of a right of appeal.  Wilson
    J. described the gap in that case in the following terms at p. 724:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
class=loose><span lang=EN>If the Besons had indeed
    no right of appeal under the statute from the Director's removal of Christopher
    from their home, then I believe there is a gap in the legislative scheme which
    the Newfoundland courts could have filled by an exercise of their <i>parens patriae</i> jurisdiction. Noel J., in
    other words, could have done more than recommend that the Director give
    Christopher the chance of the good home available with the Besons. He could
    have so ordered. It was not a matter of substituting his views for those of the
    Director. It was a matter of exercising his <i>parens
    patriae</i> jurisdiction in light of a deficiency in the statute. If it were
    not in Christopher's best interests that he be removed from the appellants'
    home, then in the absence of any statutory right of appeal through which his
    interests might be protected, Noel J. had an obligation to intervene.</span></span></p>

    the legal recognition of the parentage of one of his mothers.  There is no other way to fill this
    deficiency except through the exercise of the <i>parens patriae</i> jurisdiction.  As indicated, A.A. and C.C. cannot apply for an adoption order without
    depriving D.D. of the parentage of B.B., which would not be in D.D.’s best

    in this case is deliberate.  There is no
    doubt that the Legislature did not foresee for the possibility of declarations
    of parentage for two women, but that is a product of the social conditions and
    medical knowledge at the time.  The
    Legislature did not turn its mind to that possibility, so that over thirty
    years later the gap in the legislation has been revealed.  In the result, the statute does not provide
    for the best interests of D.D.  Moreover, a finding that the legislative gap is deliberate requires
    assigning to the Legislature a discriminatory intent in a statute designed to
    treat all children equally.  I am not
    prepared to do so.  See the comments of
    Rivard J. in <i>M.D.R.</i> at paras. 93
    -103.  There is nothing in the
    legislative history of the <i>CLRA</i> to suggest that the Legislature made a
    deliberate policy choice to exclude the children of lesbian mothers from the
    advantages of equality of status accorded to other children under the Act.</p>

    of the government.  As stated earlier,
    the Crown in Right of Ontario did not intervene in this case, but its position
    on this issue is known.  In <i>M.D.R.</i>, the Crown took the position that
    the <i>CLRA</i> in fact could be interpreted to allow for a declaration that
    two women were the mothers of a child.  Since I have found otherwise, it does no violence to the government's
    position to make the declaration sought by the appellant in this case through
    exercise of the <i>parens patriae</i> jurisdiction.  </p>

    [2004] O.J. No. 3301 (S.C.J.) at para. 125, Czutrin J. held that the exercise
    of the <i>parens patriae</i> jurisdiction
    does not depend upon a legislative gap if the exercise of that jurisdiction is
    the only way to meet the paramount objective of legislation.  I should not be taken as foreclosing that
    possibility.  Since I have found a gap,
    I have not found it necessary to decide whether the same result could be
    achieved in the way suggested by Czutrin J.</p>

    declaration sought and therefore argues that there is no gap in the legislative
    scheme to permit invoking the court’s <i>parens
    patria</i> jurisdiction. If the <i>CLRA</i> cannot be interpreted to permit making the declaration, the Children’s Lawyer
    supports the appellant’s submissions that the legislation violates ss. 7 and 15
