  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    appellant raises two issues. First, the trial judge reversed the burden of
    proof and second that she made improper use of the complainant’s prior inconsistent
    statements. Despite Ms. Trehearne’s very helpful submissions, we have not
    been persuaded that the trial judge erred. This is not a case like <i>R.
    v. Maharaj</i> (2004), 186 C.C.C. (3d) 247 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to
    Supreme Court of Canada dismissed [2004] S.C.C.A. No. 340, where the accused’s
    evidence was rejected because it conflicted with the complainant’s accepted
    evidence. The trial judge rejected the appellant’s evidence almost entirely
    because it was internally inconsistent and inherently implausible.  For example,
    the appellant claimed a close relationship with the children, yet he was
    unaware of family and personal matters that would be obvious to anyone involved
    in that relationship living in that situation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge was entitled and, indeed, required to look at all the evidence
    in determining the facts including whether the appellant’s version of the
    events might give rise to a reasonable doubt. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also did not subject the appellant’s evidence to unfair closer
    scrutiny than the prosecution evidence. She carefully explained why parts
    of the appellant’s evidence were untrue for reasons that are founded in the
    record. She closely scrutinized the complainant’s evidence but was satisfied
    with the explanation for problematic aspects of it, such as the incremental
    disclosure. She was entitled to make that assessment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    to the prior statements, we are satisfied that the trial judge did not err
    in admitting this evidence nor misuse it. The evidence was properly admitted
    as part of the narrative and provisionally admissible to rebut recent fabrication.
    As it turned out, the statements did not fully rebut the allegation of recent
    fabrication, but there is no reason to believe that the trial judge misapprehended
    the value of that evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
    importantly, the trial judge referred to the prior statements principally
    in the context of the attack on the complainant’s evidence because of the
    incremental disclosure. The defence relied on these prior statements to show
    inconsistencies in the complainant’s story. It was inevitable that the trial
    judge would have to refer to the earlier statements to explain why she accepted
    the complainant’s testimony despite the incremental disclosure. The trial
    judge spoke of the sister corroborating the complainant’s evidence but this
    statement was made principally in reference to parts of the sister’s evidence
    of what happened to her and what she saw. The reference to the complainant’s
    accusation against the appellant was proper since it preceded the family
    confrontation concerning the theft allegation.</p>

line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal from conviction is dismissed. The appeal from sentence is dismissed
    as abandoned.</p>
