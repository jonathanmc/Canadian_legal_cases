    $466 for “dancers” is principally comprised of an administrative charge of
    $59.21; a cost of $298 for compliance checks by police patrol personnel for

    to the <span lang=EN-US>definition of “dancer” in the Licensing By-law, a
    person need not perform any type of dance routine in order to be classified
    as a dancer.  In fact, that definition coupled with the definition of “services
    designed to appeal to erotic or sexual appetites or inclinations”, makes
    it clear that a person can provide any type of service in an adult entertainment
    parlour and be classified as a dancer so long as, while performing the services,
    the person is nude or partially nude.  Thus, the classification as
    “dancer” is not based on the work that the person regularly performs nor
    is it based on a person’s employment responsibilities.  Rather, the classification
    is based on the amount of clothing that the person wears while performing
    any type of work within an adult entertainment parlour.  Consequently, for
    example, under the Licensing By-law, a person who provides bartending services
    in an adult entertainment parlour, while wholly or partially nude, is a “dancer” and
    required to be licensed as such; whereas a fully&#8209;clothed person performing
    the same bartending functions is not required to pay the “dancer” licence
    fee.  </span></p>

    that the person renders a different trade or occupation.  In my view, based
    on their dictionary definitions and in accordance with their ordinary meaning,
    the words “trade”
    and “occupation” are to be taken to refer to the regular employment services
    an individual is to perform, based on his or her skills and background, and
    not the manner in which the person is attired when he or she carries out
    their employment responsibilities.  A bartender is a bartender, whether or
    not the person is fully&#8209;clothed when pouring drinks.  Similarly, a

    not give effect to this ground of appeal.</span></p>

    find myself in disagreement with the result reached by Gillese J.A.  I agree
    with and adopt her review of the facts, the proceedings, the issues and the
    positions of the parties.  This enables me to proceed directly to the areas
    where I take a different view and which would lead me to conclude that the
    City of Windsor had the power to license “dancers” as defined by the City’s
    By-law No. 395-2004 (“the Licensing By-law”) and that the licence fee was
    calculated in accordance with the <i>Municipal Act, 2001</i>, S.O. 2001,
    c. 25.  I would allow the appeal.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first issue is whether the City had the authority to license “dancers” in
    the Licensing By-law.  Gillese J.A. concludes that those parts of the Licensing
    By-law purporting to charge a licence fee for “dancers” are null and void.
    In her view, “dancers” do not constitute a different class of a trade or
    occupation. I take a different view.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    conclude that the City can treat persons who work nude or partially nude
    in an adult entertainment parlour as composing a different class than those
    who work fully clothed.  In the example discussed by Gillese J.A., I would
    regard the topless bartender working alongside the fully clothed bartender
    as performing a different job function.  The topless bartender does all the
    work of the clothed bartender and in addition titillates the patron of the
    adult entertainment parlour.  In the words of the Licensing By-law, in addition
    to doing the work of a clothed bartender, the topless bartender
    “provides services designed to appeal to erotic or sexual appetites or inclinations
    at an adult entertainment parlour.”  The job function of appealing to erotic
    or sexual appetites can be performed in conjunction with any other job functions.  The
    term “dancer” is simply the Licensing By-law’s label for the class of employees
    who perform this job function. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nude
    and partially nude workers constitute a class of employee not only because
    they provide an additional service, but also because they have different
    working conditions.  They are subject to a “dress code”.  Various aspects
    of an employer’s requirements or an employee’s preferences for manner of
    dress are the subjects of grievances in labour arbitration.  I would regard
    the authority cited by the majority, <i>Syndicat des journalists de Radio-Canada
    (CSN) v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp.</i> (2000), 23 C.C.P.B. 219 (F.C.A.),
    as supporting rather than undermining the City’s treatment of nude or partially
    nude workers as a different class. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the present case, the Licensing By-law defines a class of employees who work
    in adult entertainment parlours.  This class is characterized by the services
    it provides as well as by a working condition relating to dress. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would conclude that the City was entitled to treat employees who provide “services
    designed to appeal to erotic or sexual appetites or inclinations” as comprising
    a different class than those employees of adult entertainment parlours who
    do not provide such services.  Further, the City could use the employees’
    state of undress as the criterion to identify them as members of the class.  As
    a result, I would conclude that the application judge erred by finding that
    the City did not have the power to enact the relevant parts of the Licensing
    By-law.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge took judicial notice of the fact that the presence of many
    American young people, who visit
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Windsor because of the lower drinking age, increases the cost of policing
    in the downtown core.  I take the view there was no evidence in the record
    that the cost of general police services in the downtown core was included
    in the licence fees under the Licensing By-law.  In my view, the application
    judge’s conclusion in this regard cannot support his finding that the amount
    of the fee was invalid. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent sought to undermine the amount of the licence fee on the basis
    that the dancers’ licence fee was not based on the precise direct costs incurred
    in administering and enforcing the portion of the By-law that applied to
    dancers.  In particular, the City used gross calculations to average cost
    components across different categories of licences.  The respondents’ argument
    centered on the costs of policing the Licensing By-law and I will discuss
    this issue in that context.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    150(9) of the new <i>Municipal Act, 2001</i> requires municipalities to charge
    no more than the “costs directly related to the administration and enforcement
    of the by-law or portion of the by-law of the municipality licensing that
    class of business.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view care should be taken not to place an unworkable auditing burden on
    municipalities.  Some allocation of common costs among classes is unavoidable.  There
    are common costs in preparing and publishing the By-law.  No objection was,
    or could be taken, to allocating those costs among all classes.  The Licensing
    By-law is a general one and the schedule sets out 38 different licences,
    each with its own fee.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents objected to the By-law treating policing costs as a common cost
    allocated across several classes.  I regard treating at least some policing
    costs as common to be necessary.  For example, even if police officers were
    required to divide the time they spent at a particular adult entertainment
    parlour between checking the parlour’s licence and the dancers’ licences,
    the time spent going to the address would be common to both classes of licence.
    If the police travelled to a neighbourhood where they checked licences at
    adult entertainment parlours, holistic centres, and other licensed establishments,
    the travelling time could be allocated among several classes.  Therefore,
    in my view treating some police costs as common costs is unavoidable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    well, a question that arises about all common costs is whether they should
    be divided pro rata among licence classes or per capita among licence holders. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    seems to me that any method of allocating costs could appear to some to have
    some element of arbitrariness.  For this reason, I accept the City’s submission
    that s.&nbsp;150(9) requires it to act in good faith to allocate the direct
    costs among licensed classes in a reasonably equitable manner.  In doing
    so, it may consider some direct costs to be common to several classes and
    divide the aggregate amount of those costs among several classes. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case the City divided the total policing costs incurred in enforcing
    the By-law evenly among all the licence classes which required police inspection
    and report. Certainly a more refined allocation of costs would be possible
    if one required more detailed time records from the police.  I would not
    interfere with the City’s allocation of police costs as common across several
    classes of licence.  Its determination of what direct costs are common costs
    deserves the broad deference accorded to the exercise of municipal powers
    generally.  Allocation of costs on another basis might be equally vulnerable
    to criticism.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents, relying on two answers during the cross-examination of the City
    official who explained how licence fees were set, argued that costs other
    than direct costs were included in setting the licence fees.  The respondents
    bore the burden of proving this was the case.  The official’s comment that
    policing costs of “licensed and unlicensed” adult entertainment establishments
    were included is unclear because, in my view, the cost of enforcing the By-law
    against unlicensed premises is properly part of its enforcement costs.  The
    official’s remark that the City did not license massage parlours is undermined
    by the context in which it was given and by the fact the City does licence
    holistic centres, the definition of which includes the giving of massages.  In
    my view, the respondents required more than this isolated testimony to meet
    the burden of proving that costs other than direct costs were included in
    the licence fee. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the respondents did not establish that anything other than costs directly
    incurred in enforcing the By-law or a portion of the By-law were included,
    I would conclude the licence fee is valid.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>3. Conclusion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
    I would find that the City does have the authority to charge a licence fee
    for “dancers,” and that the fee imposed by the Licensing By-law did satisfy
    the requirements of s. 150(9) of the <i>Municipal Act, 2001</i>.  I would
    allow the appeal, set aside the declaration of the application judge, and
    replace it with an order dismissing the respondent’s application.</p>
