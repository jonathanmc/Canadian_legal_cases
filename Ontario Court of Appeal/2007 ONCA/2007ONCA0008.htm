  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    about 10:34 p.m. on June 20, 2002, near the intersection of Queen’s Quay
    and
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Jarvis Street, a tragic accident occurred.&nbsp; Mark Simmons and three companions&nbsp;were
    walking across Queen’s Quay to the south side.   A tow truck driven by the
    appellant was travelling east on Queen’s Quay when it struck and killed Mr.
    Simmons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant worked for a tow truck company owned by his father, but had finished
    work at the time of this accident.&nbsp; In the truck with him were three
    others.&nbsp; They had all just come from a restaurant about five minutes
    away on Queen’s Quay, where Mr. Hall had played pool and consumed chicken
    wings and beer. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was arrested at the scene and charged with driving while impaired,
    driving with a blood-alcohol concentration of more than 80 mg of alcohol
    in 100 ml of blood, dangerous driving causing death and criminal negligence
    causing death.&nbsp; He was tried by a judge without a jury.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    September 24, 2004 the appellant was convicted of impaired driving causing
    death, driving with blood alcohol over 80, and dangerous driving causing
    death.  He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for a total period of
    four years and ten months.  A driving prohibition for ten years was also
    imposed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals both his convictions and the sentence.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE ISSUES:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raised numerous grounds of appeal relating to his convictions.  On
    the appeal however, he abandoned several of them and relied principally on
    three.  In this regard, the appellant submits that the trial judge erred:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)        In her assessment of the “bolus drinking” evidence; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)       In drawing an adverse inference from
    the appellant’s failure to testify to support the conviction for driving
    with a blood alcohol over 80; and, </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii)     In her consideration of the evidence
    relating to the appellant’s vehicle rate of speed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
      court called upon the respondent to address the first two grounds only,
      as well as the sentence that was imposed.  In our view </span>the trial
      judge’s findings regarding the speed of the appellant’s vehicle are reasonable,
      and supported by the evidence.  Her decision on this issue is entitled
      to appellate deference. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, the respondent fairly conceded that the conviction for driving
    with blood alcohol over 80 should be conditionally stayed, and the concurrent
    sentence imposed on that charge vacated.  We agreed, and the judgment and
    sentence imposed for this offence ought to be varied accordingly. </p>

    appeal against sentence.</p>

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US>(i)        Did the trial judge err in her assessment of the “bolus
        drinking” evidence?  </span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
page-break-after:avoid'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was arrested at the scene of this tragic accident.  However, his
    breathalyser tests were conducted more than two hours later.  His blood-alcohol
    level on the first reading was 133.  His second reading, twenty minutes later,
    was 129.  The legal limit is 80.  The Crown’s expert, Dr. Buczek – and the
    only expert evidence called at trial – opined that the appellant’s blood-alcohol
    level at the time of the accident would have been between 129 and 165. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>R.
    v. Grosse</em> (1996), 107 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.) this court held that the
      Crown was required to prove the lack of bolus drinking, and that there
      is no onus on an accused person to show that he had engaged in bolus drinking.  In
      the end it is for the Crown to prove the facts that the expert’s opinion
      is based upon, including bolus drinking. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that there are aspects to the evidence that the trial judge
    failed to properly assess.  They primarily consist of the submission that
    given the evidence at trial, the Crown failed to prove beyond a reasonable
    that there was no consumption of greasy food by the appellant, accompanied
    by bolus drinking, which had the effect of delaying the absorption of alcohol
    into the appellant’s blood.  In other words, there was reasonable doubt that
    the appellant’s absorption of alcohol at the time of the accident was over
    the legal limit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is an important submission because, as the appellant says, the trial judge’s
    finding on this issue underpins her findings in respect of all the offences
    the appellant was convicted of.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Bolus
    drinking is generally described as the consumption of large quantities of
    alcohol immediately before driving: see <i>Grosse</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p.
    99.  In our case it was defined by Dr. Buczek as, “a large consumption of
    alcoholic beverage over a short period of time where there is no change in
    blood alcohol concentration”. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  The trial judge relied on the evidence of Dr.
    Buczek to find the appellant’s blood-alcohol content at the time of the accident
    to be over 80. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial the defence sought to invalidate Dr. Buczek’s opinion by demonstrating
    that the appellant consumed a large quantity of alcohol five minutes before
    the accident.&nbsp; Thus, at the time of the accident, the alcohol the appellant
    had consumed five minutes earlier may not yet have been absorbed into his
    bloodstream.&nbsp; Therefore, although his blood-alcohol exceeded the legal
    limit later, it may not have been over 80 at the time of the accident. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence relied on the testimony of two of the people who were with the appellant
    that evening, Jamie Perkins - who was called as a witness by the Crown, and
    Jeffrey Portsmith – a cousin of the appellant who was called by the defence.&nbsp; The
    appellant did not testify in his own defence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge held that the defence theory was not supported by the evidence.&nbsp; She
    was aware of, and recited completely and correctly, the theory that bolus
    drinking together with eating greasy food would slow down the absorption
    rate of alcohol such that it could have been below 80 at the time of the
    accident.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge specifically noted that the defence theory of bolus drinking
    depended on the evidence of Mr. Portsmith that the appellant drank half a
    glass of beer quickly within 10 minutes of the accident.&nbsp; The only one
    who testified to the bolus drinking was Mr. Portsmith who said that there
    was half a glass of beer left just before they left the restaurant, which
    the appellant drank quickly.  The trial judge found Mr. Portsmith’s credibility
    to be dubious and that his evidence was unreliable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that while the trial judge found Mr. Portsmith’s evidence
    to be unreliable, she did not reject it entirely.  Therefore, he submits
    that this evidence, when considered, and even though of little weight, must
    raise a reasonable doubt on the issue of bolus drinking.  He also submits
    that even if the evidence of Mr. Portsmith was rejected, the burden remained
    with the Crown to affirmatively prove the absence of bolus drinking, and
    it failed to do so.  I disagree. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is abundantly clear when one reads the reasons of the trial judge in their
    entirety that she places no weight whatsoever on the testimony of Mr. Portsmith.  She
    found Mr. Portsmith’s evidence not only unreliable, but she disbelieved him
    and found him to be a witness who lied and who was not credible.  There can
    be no doubt that the trial judge rejected his evidence on this issue entirely.  Having
    done so, there was no evidence whatsoever of bolus drinking, nor was there
    any other evidence to undermine the common-sense inference of drinking at
    a normal pace, on which the trial judge was therefore entitled to rely.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge was fully aware of the Crown’s onus of proving the correctness
    of the underlying assumptions of its expert.  This included the requirement
    that the Crown prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant did not
    engage in bolus drinking immediately before the accident.  She was satisfied
    beyond a reasonable doubt, based on all of the evidence, that his blood-alcohol
    level was well in excess of 80 at the time.  Her conclusions are wholly supported
    by the evidence and I would not interfere with her decision.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US>(ii)       Did the trial judge err in drawing an adverse inference
        from the appellant’s failure to testify?</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under
    this ground of appeal, the appellant submits that the trial judge improperly
    relied on the appellant’s failure to testify as independent piece of evidence
    to support the conviction of “over 80”.  He argues that in treating this
    evidence as she did, the trial judge effectively reversed the onus of proof
    and undermined the presumption of innocence.  The impugned portions of the
    trial judge’s decision are as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[24]     The extent of Mr. Hall’s drinking in the
    period immediately before he started driving is peculiarly within his own
    knowledge.&nbsp; In <i>R. v. Grosse, supra</i>, the Court of Appeal noted:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>In view of the circumstantial evidence that
    tended to demonstrate that the respondent [the accused] had not engaged in
    bolus drinking and the respondent’s unique position to offer an explanation,
    the trial judge was entitled to draw an adverse inference unfavourable to
    the respondent from his failure to testify to such an unusual drinking pattern.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[25]     Given the evidence before me and the theory
    of the defence, it is in my view telling that the accused did not testify.&nbsp; This
    is an incriminating set of facts.&nbsp; An explanation from the accused is
    called for, and would be the only way of rebutting the case presented.&nbsp; I
    am entitled to draw an adverse inference from the accused’s failure to testify,
    and I do so.&nbsp; I also note that the accused lied to the police at the
    scene, stating that he had nothing at all to drink.&nbsp; This may be regarded
    as consciousness of guilt, which again is unex-plained by the accused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Grosse</i>,
    as in the case before us, because tests for blood-alcohol were conducted
    more than two hours after the accident, the Crown was not entitled to rely
    on the presumption (i.e. s. 258(1)(c) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>) that the
    appellant’s blood-alcohol level at the time of the accident was the same
    as at the time of the tests.  Thus, the Crown relied upon expert evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    court concluded in <i>Grosse</i> that the trial judge could not rely on the
    expert’s evidence because it was based on an assumption of no bolus drinking.  Nevertheless,
    this court upheld the conviction primarily because there was enough circumstantial
    evidence to support the trial judge’s decision, including “applying common
    sense as to how ordinarily people behave” (p. 103).  This court then went
    on to articulate the paragraph relied upon and quoted by the trial judge
    set out above. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>Grosse</i> has
    since been overtaken in some respects by <i>R. v. Noble</i> (1997), 114 C.C.C.
    (3d) 385 (S.C.C.), which Sopinka J. writing for the majority, at para. 68
    described as an appeal concerning the evidentiary significance of the failure
    of an accused to testify at trial.&nbsp; At para. 89 he sets out the basic
    principle that; “the silence of an accused person at trial is neither inculpatory
    nor exculpatory evidence”.  He then goes on to express some basic rules regarding
    the appropriateness of a trial judge adverting to the silence of an accused
    person.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.         Where the trial judge is satisfied that
    the Crown has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt, the silence of an
    accused may be referred to as evidence of the absence of an explanation which
    could raise a reasonable doubt.&nbsp;
    (Para. 78) </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.         Where the level of the Crown’s proof
    falls short of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the silence of an accused
    may not be referred to as bridging any part of that burden.&nbsp;(Para. 81) </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.         Because the term “inference” can be
    taken to indicate that the trier of fact used silence to help establish the
    case for guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, courts should generally avoid using
    the term in discussing the silence of an accused.&nbsp;(Para. 90)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    notes that where silence is mentioned by the trial judge as confirmatory
    of guilt given the totality of the evidence, but not as a
    “make-weight”, there is no reversible error.&nbsp; That, in my view, is the
    case before us. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    would, since <i>Noble</i>, have been preferable had the trial judge in the
    case before us not used the term “adverse inference”, even though she fairly
    relied on this court’s comments in <i>Grosse</i> to do so.  However, as I
    have illustrated, those comments must be considered and assessed in light
    of Sopinka J’s pronouncements in <i>Noble</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    considering the trial judge’s reasons as a whole, it is clear to me that
    she was always aware of the burden of proof and where it lay.  In sum, there
    was evidence, which she accepted, to prove the accuracy of Dr. Buczek’s calculation
    of the appellant’s blood alcohol concentration at the time of driving.  That
    conclusion was reached without any reliance on an adverse inference, and
    without in any way shifting the onus of proof from the prosecution.  If there
    was any error by the trial judge, it did not result in any substantial wrong
    or miscarriage of justice.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US> (iii)    The sentence appeal</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant essentially limits his argument on the sentence appeal to that
    of the sentence being excessive coupled with the submission that the trial
    judge identified the wrong range for this type of offence.  It follows therefore
    that appellate interference may only be justified if the sentence is demonstrably
    unfit; that is, the sentence imposed is “clearly unreasonable” or a “substantial

    committing similar crimes.” </p>

    my view, there is no basis upon which to interfere with the four years and
    ten-month sentence imposed by the trial judge.  She applied the proper principles,
    considered all submissions and authorities, and evaluated the mitigating
    and aggravating factors - including the appellant’s prior related conviction.  She
    reviewed the appellant’s pre-sentence report, and recognized that the appellant’s
    moral blameworthiness was high.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if the trial judge incorrectly considered the range of sentence for similar
    offences, she nevertheless rendered a fit and proper sentence in this case.  The
    sentence was warranted for this offender and these offences. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    I would grant leave to appeal the four years and ten month total sentence
    the appellant received, I would dismiss the appeal, except as noted below.</p>

    appeal as to conviction should be allowed but only to the extent of quashing
    the conviction on the charge of over 80 and substituting a conditional stay.  In
    addition, I would vacate the sentence of two years less a day imposed in
    respect of that offence that was to run concurrent.  I would dismiss the
    balance of the appeal against convictions.  Finally, I would allow leave
    to appeal the sentence, but I would dismiss the appeal, except in relation
    to the offence of over 80.</p>
