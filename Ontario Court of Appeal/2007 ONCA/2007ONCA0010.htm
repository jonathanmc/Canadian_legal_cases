  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment of
    Justice R. Thomas of the Superior Court of Justice dated March 14, 2005.</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant and another person – a known drug
    dealer – were being observed by police officers.  During these observations, the police
    officers formed the belief that the appellant was in possession of a
    firearm.  As a result, the appellant was
    arrested and when searched was found to be in possession of a fully-loaded,
    ready to fire semi-automatic .45 calibre handgun and crack cocaine.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At the commencement of the trial, the trial
    judge ruled that the arrest and search were lawful, and the appellant was
    subsequently convicted of various weapons offences and possession of
    cocaine.  He was sentenced to a total
    period of imprisonment of three years. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant appeals both the convictions and
    sentence, and primarily submits that the trial judge erred in his decisions
    respecting alleged breaches of the <i>Charter
    of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  We disagree
    and we would dismiss the appeal.  We
    believe this entire appeal can be disposed of with our decision on the
    lawfulness of the arrest. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is a lawful arrest when a police officer
    subjectively believes that there are grounds to do so, and those grounds are
    objectively reasonable.  The totality of
    the circumstances relied upon by the arresting officer will form the basis for
    the objective assessment.  It would
    constitute an error in law to assess each fact or observation in
    isolation.  An objective assessment will
    include the dynamics within which the police officer acted, and his or her
    experience: see <i>R. v. Golub</i> (1997),
    117 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this case, the trial judge examined the
    evidence fully and made findings supported by that evidence.  We do not agree that the trial judge ignored
    or failed to appreciate any of the relevant evidence.  Moreover, we agree that the evidence
    regarding police training was a relevant factor to consider in his
    analysis.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the end, the trial judge applied the proper
    test and considered all the facts and observations of the police officers in
    totality and in the context of the circumstances they were confronted
    with.  There was no contradictory
    evidence placed before the court, and the appellant did not testify on the <i>voir dire</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge’s decision as to the
    reasonableness of the police officers’ belief that the appellant was in
    possession of a firearm should not be disturbed.  Consequently, the arrest was lawful and so
    was the search that was incidental to it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given our conclusion on the lawfulness of the
    arrest and search, there is no need to address any of the appellant’s other
    grounds of appeal on his convictions. The appeal against convictions is
    therefore dismissed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As to appellant’s leave to appeal sentence, we
    would grant leave but dismiss the appeal.  The appellant received a total sentence of three years after credit for
    pre-trial custody of twenty-eight days.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In our view, even if the experienced trial judge
    failed to consider the appellant’s bail conditions as a mitigating factor in
    fixing sentence pursuant to <i>R. v. Downes</i>,
    (2005) C.C.C. (3d) 488, at para. 42, his failure to do so is not fatal to the
    ultimate sentence imposed.  He was entitled
    to emphasize community safety and the need to continue to send the message of
    deterrence to those who threaten that safety with firearms.  This is particularly the case where – as here
    - the firearm was high calibre, fully loaded, ready to fire, and had the serial
    numbers obliterated. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We can
    find no basis upon which to interfere with the total sentence of three years
    imprisonment imposed by the trial judge for these offences committed by this
    offender.</p>
