  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, Susan Doe, appeals from the order of Dambrot&nbsp;J. dated January&nbsp;19,&nbsp;2006
    dismissing her application for a declaration that the definition of “assisted
    conception” in s.&nbsp;1 of the <i>Processing and Distribution of Semen for
    Assisted Conception Regulations</i>, S.O.R./96-254 (the “<i>Regulations</i>”)
    infringes ss.&nbsp;7 and 15 of the Canadian<i> Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i> (the “<i>Charter</i>”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    definition of “assisted conception” in the <i>Regulations</i> is:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“assisted conception” means a reproductive technique
    performed on a woman for the purpose of conception, using semen from a donor
    who is not her spouse or sexual partner.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Regulations</i> impose
    rigorous donor screening and testing requirements in respect of semen used
    in assisted conception in a clinic setting.  However, by virtue of the definition
    of
    “assisted conception”, the regime does not apply to women who use semen from
    a spouse or sexual partner.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the definition of “assisted conception” has an adverse
    effect on lesbian women who by definition cannot be inseminated by a spouse
    or sexual partner.  She contends that the regulatory regime was designed
    with anonymous donors in mind and was not intended to apply to a situation
    like hers where she has selected a known donor who is not her spouse or sexual
    partner.  Accordingly, her <i>Charter</i> s.&nbsp;15 equality right is violated.  The
    appellant further submits that the <i>Regulations</i> restrict her right
    to determine who will be the father of her child and give rise to psychological
    suffering, thus violating her <i>Charter</i> s.&nbsp;7 rights to liberty
    and security of the person.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    intervener D is a gay man who is willing to donate his semen to assist the
    appellant’s conception.  He, and the intervener Egale Canada Inc., support
    the appellant’s legal arguments.  The interveners also contend that the <i>Regulations</i> violate
    D’s ss.&nbsp;7 and 15 rights.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge rejected the appellant’s and interveners’ arguments.  He
    held that the <i>Regulations</i> did not violate the appellant’s ss.&nbsp;7
    and 15 rights.  He further held that the interveners’ arguments fell outside
    the scope of Dyson&nbsp;J.’s order relating to intervener status.  Accordingly,
    he did not address the merits of the interveners’ constitutional arguments.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant is a 40&#8209;year&#8209;old lesbian woman who is in a long&#8209;term
    relationship with her partner, J.  The appellant and J previously had a child,
    with J bearing the child and the intervener D acting as the semen donor.  The
    appellant and J want their second child to be biologically related to their
    first.  D was somewhat reluctant to provide his semen to the appellant; his
    preference was to provide his semen to J.  D did, however, agree to provide
    up to six samples to the appellant.  Because the appellant has not been able
    to conceive through self&#8209;insemination, and because D was prepared to
    provide only a small number of semen samples, the appellant decided to attempt
    to conceive through the assisted conception regime.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Regulations</i> incorporate
    by reference the <i>Technical Requirements for Therapeutic Donor Insemination</i> published
    by Health
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    (the
    “Directive”).  The Directive contains detailed requirements respecting donor
    exclusion, including “age greater than 40 years” (the “over 40 exclusion”)
    and indications of high risk for diseases such as HIV, and Hepatitis B and
    C viruses, including “men who have had sex with another man, even once, since
    1977” (the “MSM exclusion”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
    these exclusions, it is possible for an excluded man to be a donor.  Since
    2000, the <i>Donor Semen Special Access Program</i> (the “<i>DSSAP</i>”)
    has permitted a physician to apply to the Minister of Health for a “special
    access authorization” permitting the distribution of semen that has not been
    processed in accordance with the <i>Regulations</i>.  The special access
    program is explained in a guidance document prepared by Health
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  Health Canada amended the guidance document in 2002 to make it clear that
    special access authorization is available to women who seek to be inseminated
    by the semen of a donor who would otherwise be excluded based on the exclusion
    criteria.  However, before a special access authorization can be issued,
    the semen must first receive a negative result from testing for infectious
    agents such as HIV and Hepatitis, be quarantined for six months, and be retested
    after the quarantine.  If all tests are negative, a woman may ask her physician
    to apply for a special access authorization from Health

    is a gay man and is over 40, and so to donate his semen he would have to
    go through the special access program.  The appellant did not apply for a
    special access authorization, however, because D is not willing to have his
    semen stored by a semen bank, as would be required.  Apparently, he is concerned
    that someone other than the appellant might gain access to his semen.</p>

      when she commenced her application, was in substantially the same situation
      as the appellant.  Justice Brennan dismissed Jane&nbsp;Doe’s application
      on the basis that it was moot, since by the time the application was heard
      Jane&nbsp;Doe had become pregnant through home insemination: see </span><i><span
lang=EN-US>Jane Doe v. Canada (Attorney General)</span></i><span lang=EN-US> (2003),

      appeal, this court concluded that Brennan&nbsp;J. did not err in refusing
      to determine the issue raised by Jane&nbsp;Doe.  However, while the appeal
      was under reserve, the appellant and D brought a motion to intervene as
      parties to the appeal.  The court granted the motion and remitted the application
      to a different judge of the Superior Court of Justice for a hearing on
      the same record that had been before Brennan</span>&nbsp;J.  The court
      ordered that the appellant be added as a party and D as an intervener:
      see <i>Jane Doe v.

'>[2]</span></span></span></a>, Egale Canada Inc. and B, the proposed donor of
    semen to Jane Doe, had been granted intervener status by Dyson&nbsp;J.  When
    this court granted intervener status to D, it did so on the basis that the
    terms of his intervention would be the same as those relating to B in Dyson&nbsp;J.’s
    order.  One of the terms of that order was that the interveners could not
    raise issues relating to the rights of anonymous sperm donors and would not
    seek relief beyond the relief sought in the Notice of Application.</p>

    15 of the <i>Charter</i> guarantees to every individual the right to equal

    ground of discrimination: see <i>Egan v. Canada</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 513,

      Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Minister of Employment and Immigration)</i>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 497 (“<i>Law</i>”).  In
    that case, Iacobucci&nbsp;J. articulated a three&#8209;step inquiry, at para.&nbsp;39:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>First, does the impugned law (a) draw a formal
    distinction between the claimant and others on the basis of one or more personal
    characteristics, or (b) fail to take into account the claimant’s already
    disadvantaged position within Canadian society resulting in substantively
    differential treatment between the claimant and others on the basis of one
    or more personal characteristics?  If so, there is a differential treatment
    for the purposes of s.&nbsp;15(1).  Second, was the claimant subject to differential
    treatment on the basis of one or more of the enumerated and analogous grounds?  And
    third, does the differential treatment discriminate in a substantive sense,
    bringing into play the purpose of s&nbsp;15(1) of the <i>Charter</i> in remedying
    such ills as prejudice, stereotyping, and historical disadvantage?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge faithfully applied the <i>Law</i> analysis.  However, before
    turning to it, he quite properly addressed three preliminary issues: the
    purpose of the <i>Regulations</i>, the reason for the exclusion of women
    proposing to use semen from donors who are their spouses and sexual partners

    application judge described the purpose of the <i>Regulations</i> as “to

    in imposing the Semen Regulations on a woman seeking assisted conception
    with the semen of her spouse or sexual partner, because she has already been
    exposed to any risk that exists”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the final preliminary issue, the application judge determined that “the appropriate
    comparator group is women seeking insemination with the semen of their spouse
    or sexual partner” because the women in this group are specifically excluded
    from the need to comply with the strict requirements, especially testing,
    of the regulatory scheme.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the first step in the analysis, the application judge determined
    that “because lesbians do not ordinarily have spouses or sexual partners
    who can donate semen, the effect of the Regulations is to deny them exemption
    from the scheme, and therefore, in its effect, to impose differential treatment
    between them and those in the comparator group on the basis of a personal
    characteristic.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning
    to the second step in the <i>Law</i> analysis, the application judge concluded
    that it was here that the appellant’s claim foundered:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, the applicant’s claim fails on this
    issue. While it is true that the exclusion created by the definition of assisted
    conception is available more often to heterosexual women than to lesbians,
    sexual orientation is not the basis for the differential treatment. The unavailability
    of the exclusion to most lesbians does not rest on sexual orientation. As
    I have discussed above, it rests entirely on the simple rationale that there
    is little point in imposing the Semen Regulations on a woman seeking assisted
    conception with the semen of her spouse or sexual partner, because she has
    already been exposed to any risk that exists.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge also found against the appellant on the third step in the <i>Law</i> analysis.  He
    reasoned:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It cannot be doubted that lesbians have experienced
    disadvantage, stereotyping, prejudice and vulnerability in our society. There
    are those who view them as less worthy of recognition or value as human beings
    or members of Canadian society. Undoubtedly there are still those who believe
    them to be less worthy of being mothers than are heterosexual women, and
    who would deny them the right to have children.&nbsp; The legislation, however,
    does not deny lesbians the right to have children, or to be clinically inseminated.
    It is simply the case that because they do not ordinarily have spouses or
    sexual partners capable of being donors, a health based exclusion from the
    regulatory scheme governing assisted conception is unavailable to them. Does
    this simple fact, having regard to the contextual considerations I have listed,
    discriminate, by imposing a burden upon or withholding a benefit from the
    claimant in a manner which reflects the stereotypical application of presumed
    group or personal characteristics, or which otherwise has the effect of perpetuating
    or promoting the view that the individual is less capable or worthy of recognition
    or value as a human being or as a member of Canadian society, equally deserving
    of concern, respect, and consideration?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view it does not. The legislation does not
    exclude all heterosexual women with known donors from the regulatory scheme,
    only those with donors who are their spouse or sexual partner. Lesbians and
    other heterosexual women with known donors are treated identically. The narrow
    exclusion is rational and health-based. The scheme simply does not convey
    the message that lesbians are less worthy of recognition or value as human
    beings or members of Canadian society than other women, that they are less
    worthy of being mothers than are other women, and that they should be denied
    the right to have children.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    pivot for the appellant’s challenge of the application judge’s s.&nbsp;15
    analysis is his finding that the purpose of the <i>Regulations</i> is health&#8209;related,
    namely, the protection of women and unborn children.  In oral argument, the
    appellant’s counsel described the purpose issue as “the $64,000 question” and
    candidly acknowledged that “if I am wrong with respect to the purpose of
    the <i>Regulations</i>, I have a much tougher case.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant expressly accepts the application judge’s description of the overall
    purpose of the <i>Regulations</i> as being the protection of women undergoing
    assisted conception and unborn children.  However, the appellant asserts
    that the context within which the <i>Regulations</i> are intended to operate
    is <i>only</i> with respect to anonymous donors of semen.  The exemption
    for women whose donors are their spouse or sexual partner, as the appellant
    puts it in her factum, “can only reflect one thing: a recognition that women
    are entitled to knowingly and voluntarily accept the risks to themselves
    and to their unborn children associated with conceiving a child with the
    donor of their choice.”  This ‘voluntariness’ anchor for the <i>Regulations</i> should
    apply to both heterosexual and lesbian women using known donors.  Since the
    definition of “assisted conception”
    explicitly excludes women using a certain category of known donors (spouses
    and sexual partners) from the regulatory regime, it should do the same for
    lesbian women proposing to use known donors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge dealt comprehensively with this argument in his reasons.  He
    carefully considered the background leading to the <i>Regulations</i>, including
    the report of the <i>Royal Commission on New Reproductive Technologies</i>,
    the evidence of Dr.&nbsp;Clifford Librach, a physician who provided an affidavit
    on behalf of the appellant, and the wording of the <i>Regulations</i>.  He
    reasoned:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>With respect to the nature of the scheme, simple
    logic tells me that the justification for the exemption of spouses and sexual
    partners cannot be a recognition that women are entitled to knowingly and
    voluntarily accept the risks to themselves and to their unborn children associated
    with conceiving a child with the donor of their choice. It would be impossible
    to reconcile that purpose with the fact that a heterosexual woman who wants
    to be inseminated by a known donor is not exempt from the scheme. Her donor’s
    semen must be collected, stored and tested. In other words, a heterosexual
    woman who wants to be inseminated by a known donor is denied the right to
    knowingly and voluntarily accept the risks to themselves and to their unborn
    children associated with conceiving a child with the donor of their choice.&nbsp; While
    such women may represent a smaller group than do lesbian women who want to
    be inseminated by a known donor (although there is no evidence to that effect),
    it remains the case that they were consciously not excluded from the scheme,
    and so the applicant must have misidentified the rationale for the exclusion
    of spouses and sexual partners.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is not surprising that the rationale for the
    exclusion is not the one advanced by the applicant. This scheme, after all,
    is not primarily concerned with personal autonomy or self-actualization,
    but rather with health. One should search first, logically enough, for a
    health-based rationale for a provision in the scheme. Here there is one – the
    one advanced by the respondent – and it is a logical one. It makes perfect
    sense to exclude from the scheme women seeking assisted conception with the
    semen of their spouses or sexual partners, because there is no point in imposing
    the Semen Regulations on such women having regard to the fact that they have
    already been exposed to any risk that exists, and will likely continue to
    be exposed. It also makes perfect sense not to exclude any other donors,
    but rather to insist on the same safeguards for all of them, whether they
    are known to the woman or not.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>I agree with this reasoning.  In
    my view, it is, in a word, impeccable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once
    the application judge’s description of the purpose of the <i>Regulations</i>,
    both overall and in terms of the spousal and sexual partner exclusion, is
    affirmed, the appellant’s other s.&nbsp;15 arguments fall away.  The application
    judge’s analysis and conclusions on the second step (differential treatment,
    but not on the basis of sexual orientation) and the third step (differential
    treatment, but not involving prejudice, stereotyping and historical disadvantage)
    of <i>Law</i> are correct.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
      the over 40 and MSM exclusions are no longer absolute exclusions.  Women
      with known donors in these exclusion categories – in other words, the appellant
      and D – are now eligible to participate in the assisted conception program.  As
      explained by the application judge:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>To reiterate, the Regulations are intended to protect
    the health of the woman seeking to conceive through assisted conception,
    as well as their partners and their future children.  Consistent with this
    purpose, the Regulations also prohibit the processing and distribution of
    semen from donors who come within an excluded group set out in a directive
    entitled <i>Technical Requirements for Therapeutic Donor Insemination</i> published
    by the Department of Health (“the Directive”). Among the persons excluded
    are persons of an age greater than 40 and persons with indications of high
    risk for HIV, Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus or human T-call Lymphotropic
    Virus, including men who have had sex with another man, even once, since
    1977.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Despite the exclusion, it is possible for an excluded
    man to be a donor. The Regulations permit a physician to apply to the Minister
    of Health for a “special access authorization” permitting the distribution
    of semen that has not been processed in accordance with the Regulations.&nbsp; Health
    Canada’s Guidance Document on the Donor Semen Special Access Program (“DSSAP”)
    has been amended to make clear that special access authorization is available
    to women who seek to be inseminated by the semen from a donor who would otherwise
    be excluded based on the exclusion criteria contained in the Directive. Before
    a special access authorization can be issued, however, the semen must first
    receive a negative result to testing for the infectious agents of HIV 1 and
    HIV 2, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C.</p>

      over 40 exclusion relates to age, not sexual orientation.  Moreover, the
      age distinction (which applies to all men, heterosexual and gay) is not
      substantively discriminatory.  There is a clear correspondence between
      the ground of age and the nature of the differential treatment.  As noted

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">

      MSM exclusion does create a distinction between gay and heterosexual donors.  However,
      the differential treatment is not discriminatory and does not promote the
      view that gay men are less worthy of being parents.  The MSM exclusion,
      like the many other exclusions in the <i>Regulations</i>, is based on health
      considerations.  The medical evidence in the record establishes that there
      is a higher prevalence of HIV and Hepatitis among men in the MSM category.  The
      actual increased risk of acquiring and transmitting these diseases in this

    document potentially expands access to the <i>DSSAP</i>), the application
    judge treated the guidance document as valid and effective, while urging
    the government “to regularize it at an early opportunity by appropriately
    amending the Regulations.”  There is no suggestion that Health Canada does
    not administer the <i>Regulations</i> in accordance with the 2002 guidance
    document.  In any event, I am satisfied that, properly interpreted, there
    is no conflict between the guidance document and the <i>Regulations</i>.  Accordingly,
    I will proceed on the same basis as the application judge.</p>
