    appellant appeals the finding of Justice Joseph G. Quinn of the Superior
    Court of Justice that the appellant is a dangerous offender.  The dangerous

    October 3, 1998 between midnight and 1:00 a.m., the appellant broke into
    the house of M.M., a 77-year-old widow.  The house was located in a rural
    area of the
    <st1:PlaceType

    Township of

    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    County of
    <st1:PlaceName

    Essex.  The appellant entered Ms. M.’s bedroom, sprayed a fire extinguisher
    around the room and pushed Ms. M. onto her bed.  He put his hand over her
    face and raped her.  The appellant wore gloves, a mask and carried a flashlight.  Ms.
    M. suffered a number of bruises from the encounter.  She was able to contact
    the police by making a 9-1-1 call.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>July 5, 1986</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the early hours of July 5, 1986, the appellant broke into the rural home
    of S.B., an 82-year-old widow.  The house was located in the
    <st1:PlaceType

    Essex.  The appellant cut the telephone wires to the house before the break-in
    and then gained entry by smashing a window.  Ms. B. was awakened and shouted
    at the intruder to get out.  The appellant was masked and after a struggle
    with Ms. B., he raped her.  After the appellant left, Ms. B. sat on the edge
    of her bed until daylight and then walked to her son’s house some 700 feet
    down a concession road.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>September 14, 1985</span></h4>

    September 14, 1985, at about 11:00 p.m., the appellant broke into the rural
    residence of O.N., an 83-year-old widow.  The house was located in the

    appellant had also cut the telephone wires to the house.  Upon gaining entry
    to Ms. N.’s house, the appellant attacked her and raped her.  The appellant
    wore a black balaclava.  Ms. N. suffered bruising to her face.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>June 19, 1983</span></h4>

    June 19, 1983 at about 12:15 a.m., the appellant broke into the rural residence
    of C.R., a 74-year-old widow.  He had cut the telephone wires to the house
    before entering.  Ms. R. was asleep when she was awakened by a loud noise
    in the kitchen area.  She got out of bed and walked to the kitchen where
    she was grabbed by the appellant.  He put his hand over her mouth and pushed
    her into the bedroom.  He tied her hands and feet with rope to the top and
    bottom of the bed.  He put a pillow over her face and raped her.  There were
    burn marks on her wrists and her right ankle from the rope.  She had two
    small scratches on her nose.  After the assault, she was able to free herself
    and walk to her daughter’s house nearby.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    impact of these offences on each of the victims and their families was devastating.  None
    of the victims continued to live in their homes where they had lived alone.  At
    the time of trial, three of the four victims had died.  The fourth victim
    was unable to testify.  The appellant was convicted on the basis of DNA expert
    evidence.  The DNA evidence identified the appellant’s semen at the scene
    of each crime.  The appellant testified and denied his guilt.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE DANGEROUS OFFENDER APPLICATION</span></h4>

    the dangerous offender application hearing, counsel for the appellant made
    the following admissions:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Your Honour, I have been directed by Mr. Grayer
    to make certain admissions today before Your Honour and this Honourable Court
    and the admissions that are being made now are as follows: that Mr. Grayer
    lied before the ladies and gentlemen of the jury when he testified in effect
    that he did not commit sexual assault against Ms. Michinski, Ms. Bansky,
    Ms. Rayner and Ms. Nodello.  In fact, he did commit sexual assault upon those
    victims.  Those are the admissions.  That’s the first matter.  Is that right,
    Mr. Grayer?  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>MR. GRAYER:          Yes, yes, Your Honour.</p>

    the conclusion of the dangerous offender application, the appellant addressed
    the court as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I sincerely apologize to my victims and their families
    for the terrible suffering I have caused them.  I would also like to apologize
    to my family and friends, to Your Honour, and also to Mr. Harrison.  In my
    life I have made destructive decisions but with proper help I strongly believe
    I can turn my life around.  And I would comply with any treatment order Your
    Honour recommends.  I will take any medication my doctor prescribes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was born on September 7, 1956.  He was 42-years-old when he committed
    the last sexual assault for which he was convicted.  He was 46-years-old
    at  the time of sentencing.  He is now 50-years-old.  He grew up on a farm
    near
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Windsor and comes from a family of 12 brothers and sisters.  When he was
    arrested, he was living with his common-law partner and three children.  He
    was working as a heavy equipment operator and had a good work history.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s criminal record was filed which consisted of a 1980 assault for
    which he was fined $150 and a 1980 possession of property obtained by crime
    under $200 for which he was fined $175.  In 1991, he was convicted of obstructing
    a peace officer and fined $400.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown called Dr. Philip Klassen, a psychiatrist, who was on the staff of
    the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto (the
    “Centre”).  Counsel for the appellant called Dr. Julian Gojer, also a staff
    psychiatrist with the Centre.  In addition, counsel for the appellant called
    Dr. William Palmer, a psychologist who had been employed by Corrections Canada
    at the Warkworth penitentiary between 1975 and 1998.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Klassen was the only expert witness who had met with the appellant.  The
    appellant was a patient at the Centre for some 55 days and Dr. Klassen met
    with him for a total of 8 to 12 hours.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Gojer and Dr. Palmer, in rendering their opinions, each relied on information
    provided by Dr. Klassen in his report and in his evidence.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Dr. Klassen’s Evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Klassen conducted the assessment of the appellant ordered by the trial judge
    pursuant to s. 752.1(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Dr. Klassen concluded
    that the appellant suffered from gerontophilia, a sexual deviancy marked
    by a preference for elderly female victims.  There is no cure for this condition.  One’s
    sexual preference has its onset in adolescence and remains for life.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Klassen was concerned with conducting an assessment of the appellant’s risk
    to offend in the future.  His assessment proved to be difficult due to a
    lack of relevant information.  There was not much information concerning
    the appellant’s sexual relations with his partners.  He refused to permit
    his former partner or his siblings to speak to Dr. Klassen.  The appellant’s
    current partner at first agreed to speak to Dr. Klassen but then refused.  She
    provided a note which was not of much use.  The appellant did not talk to
    Dr. Klassen about his involvement in the index offences.  He refused to participate
    in phallometric testing.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant expressed much hostility to others for his convictions.  He alleged
    the police had lied and planted evidence.  He described the jury as crooked.  He
    complained that the judge was not qualified and had blocked evidence. He
    also complained that his lawyer was working with the Crown.  He alleged that
    the Crown was somehow involved with the jury foreman.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant told Dr. Klassen that he had not committed any offences for which
    he had any regrets and that he did not feel sorry or guilty.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    order to carry out his assessment of the risk of the appellant re-offending,
    Dr. Klassen employed two risk assessment tools – the Sex Offender Risk Appraisal
    Guide (“SORAG”) and the STATIC-99.  Both of these instruments employ actuarial
    methods to provide probabilistic estimates of risk.  Dr. Klassen stated in
    his report to the court that “probabilistic estimates of risk indicate the
    percentage of people, with the same score, on a given metric or risk assessment
    tool, who would be expected to re-offend within a defined period of opportunity.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    SORAG instrument takes account of different factors to arrive at a score
    for a particular individual.  In the appellant’s case, Dr. Klassen was unable
    to score two factors – phallometric test results and sufficient background
    to complete a Psychopathy Checklist.  These two factors each received a zero.  The
    appellant’s SORAG score was +11 with a 59 percent long-term risk (over 15
    years) to re-offend.  If he had been able to conclude that the appellant
    suffered from a personality disorder, which he suspected, but could not prove,
    his score would have been +16 which placed him in the 76 percent long-term
    risk for re-offending.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    STATIC-99 actuarial instrument produced a score for the appellant of 3 which
    Dr. Klassen said was moderately low.  On this score, the appellant had a
    34 percent risk of re-offending in a sexually violent manner over 15 years.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Klassen acknowledged that the SORAG and STATIC-99 instruments produced divergent
    results.  By way of explanation, he observed that the STATIC-99 instrument
    treated all of the appellant’s offences as one offence because he was to
    be sentenced on all offences at the same time.  In respect of both instruments,
    Dr. Klassen said they produced floor probabilities and that they probably
    under-estimated the risk to re-offend by between 15 and 35 percent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Klassen, in his report, said that the appellant was a moderate risk to re-offend.  In
    his evidence at the dangerous offender hearing, he testified that the appellant
    was probably in the moderate to moderately high category of risk to re-offend, “but
    in the moderate risk range”.  He also testified that if the four convictions
    were treated separately by the STATIC-99, then the appellant’s score would
    be 5 rather than 3 which would put him in the moderately high range with
    a risk to re-offend of 52 percent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Klassen was asked his opinion about what possible risk management might be
    available to the appellant.  Dr. Klassen responded that there are two treatment
    approaches to deviant sexual interest – the psychological and the pharmacological.  At
    the time that Dr. Klassen saw the appellant, he would not have been accepted
    into psychological treatment.  He expressed a high degree of animosity towards
    the authorities and denied offending or any sexual behaviour problem.  There
    were also problems related to the pharmacological treatment (chemical castration).  Dr.
    Klassen testified that the biggest problem with pharmacological sex drive
    reduction has been the fact that offenders do not want to take the drugs.  It
    is very difficult to convince offenders to take the drugs because all sex
    drive is suppressed equally.  The drugs do not target the deviant sex drive;
    sexual function is largely extinguished, including consensual sexual function.  There
    is also a problem of titrating the proper dose.  You have to rely on self-reporting
    from the offender.  There are also problems related to the side effects of
    the sex drive reducing drugs and again, one has to rely on the self-report
    of the offender to give you straight answers concerning the side effects.  There
    is a risk the offender will fabricate the effects to get off the drugs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Klassen was questioned as to what effect age would have in respect of the
    management of a deviant sexual offender.  He replied that age is an important
    variable in offenders against adult females.  He testified that there is
    a significant declining effect in respect of sexual activity for offenders
    in their sixth decade.  However, exactly when the decline in deviant sexual
    desire and conduct may occur is not possible to pinpoint.  Dr. Klassen testified
    that he had not personally assessed a person in his fifties who committed
    a violent sexual assault against an adult female.  Similarly, none of his
    colleagues had done so.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Dr. Gojer’s Evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Gojer, a witness called by counsel for the appellant, testified that using
    Dr. Klassen’s SORAG scoring, the appellant is a moderate risk to re-offend.  On
    the basis of Dr. Klassen’s STATIC-99 scoring, the appellant is in a moderate
    to low moderate range to re-offend.  He attributed the lower STATIC-99 score
    to the fact that the STATIC-99 instrument treats all four offences as one
    offence while the SORAG instrument treats them separately.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was Dr. Gojer’s opinion that the STATIC-99 instrument should be given slightly
    more weight than the SORAG instrument but he would agree with Dr. Klassen
    that overall the SORAG is more robust.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Gojer testified that a clinical assessment is important in order to obtain
    further information from a dynamic perspective.  It is important to talk
    to the offender to obtain information about the offences and what caused
    him to select a certain victim and to plan his offending conduct.  It is
    also important to know what was going on in the offender’s life that caused
    him to commit such serious crimes.  The offender’s history of sexual violence

    Gojer testified that the appellant may oscillate between a low moderate and
    high moderate risk to re-offend. However, his conclusion, simply stated,
    was that he was a moderate risk to re-offend.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the end of his cross-examination, Dr. Gojer concluded that the appellant
    represented a substantial risk to re-offend.  He reasoned as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The conclusion is based on the fact that if he
    is at least a moderate to moderately high risk to re-offend [<i>sic</i>].  It’s
    also based on a clinical aspect that this individual has a paraphilia which
    tells you there’s a pattern of offending and the pattern is expected to continue
    at least till the mid-50’s.  And to me in my opinion, that would at least
    mean that he would be a substantial risk to the community.</p>

    Gojer was asked about risk management of the appellant.  He said that even
    at a moderate risk to offend, from a clinical perspective, he would not be
    prepared to let the appellant into the community.  Dr. Gojer said that his
    release had to be predicated upon taking sex drive reducing drugs.  </p>

    William Palmer is a psychologist who was called as a witness by counsel for
    the appellant.  He testified as to the use within the penitentiary system
    of the General Statistical Index of Recidivism (“GSIR”).  This tool predicts
    violent recidivism and is used to determine the placement of offenders within
    the penitentiary system and to assess an inmate’s risk of recidivism upon
    release.  It was not used by either Dr. Klassen or Dr. Gojer.  Using this
    tool, Dr. Palmer concluded that the appellant was a 5 percent risk to re-offend
    violently after three years and an 11 percent risk to re-offend violently
    in 10 years.  Dr. Palmer was not aware of any studies comparing the GSIR
    to either the SORAG or the STATIC-99.   </p>

    Palmer accepted Dr. Klassen’s conclusion that the appellant is likely a moderate
    risk to re-offend from an actuarial perspective.  He agreed in cross-examination
    that one may tend to adjust the actuarial data slightly by reference to clinical
    data.  He also agreed that clinical data was relevant to how one manages
    the treatment of a sexual offender, assuming that he gets out of jail at
    some point in the future.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE REASONS OF THE TRIAL JUDGE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge reviewed the evidence of Dr. Klassen, Dr. Gojer and Dr. Palmer.  He
    then turned to a consideration of the criteria for making a dangerous offender
    finding as provided in s. 753(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  After quoting
    the aforesaid section, the trial judge stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Crown must prove the following beyond a reasonable
    doubt.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    Dayle Grayer was convicted of a serious personal injury offence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    the offence for which Dayle Grayer was convicted was part of a pattern of
    behaviour which has involved violence, aggressiveness or brutal conduct or
    a failure to control sexual impulses.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    Dayle Grayer’s past pattern of conduct was likely to continue and to result
    in the kind of suffering against which the section seeks to protect, that
    is, endangering the life, safety or physical well being of others or in the
    case of sexual offences, conduct causing injury, pain or other evil to other
    persons.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is acknowledged by counsel and I find as a fact
    that the first two criteria have been proved by the Crown beyond a reasonable
    doubt.  The offence of breaking and entering the residence of an elderly
    lady and then sexually assaulting that elderly lady is a serious personal
    injury offence.  Dayle Grayer’s offences all involved the break and enter
    of a residence of an elderly lady and sexual assault.  The offences took
    place on June 19th, 1983, September 14th, 1985, July 5th, 1986 and October
    the 3rd, 1998.  This was obviously a pattern of behaviour involving violence,
    brutal conduct and an inability to control sexual impulses.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The issue which has been the central focus of this
    hearing and which the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is the likelihood
    that Dayle Grayer will commit similar offences when released.  I must be
    satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that based on evidence presented at this
    hearing, not that Dayle Grayer will re-offend in the future, but that there
    is a likelihood that Dayle Grayer in the future will commit similar offences.  In
    order to make a finding on this issue I must as Morden J. stated in <i>R.
    v. Knight</i> (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 343 at 356:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>refer to the quality and strength of the evidence
    of past and present facts together with the expert opinion thereon as an
    existing basis for finding present likelihood of future conduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    should state that no issue is taken on this appeal with the trial judge’s
    summary of the relevant criteria for a dangerous offender finding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge observed that there was no disagreement among the experts that
    the appellant suffered from gerontophilia, a coercive sexual preference for
    elderly females – a life-long condition that may be controlled or managed
    but not cured.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    considering the evidence relating to the actuarial risk of re-offending,
    the trial judge rejected the argument of counsel for the appellant that the
    STATIC-99 results raised a reasonable doubt that the appellant will re-offend.  The
    trial judge found that the STATIC-99 instrument indicated a moderate risk
    to re-offend.  He observed that a moderate risk is not a low risk or no risk.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also concluded that the divergent results of the two actuarial
    instruments, used by Dr. Klassen, cut down their reliability as predictors
    of future risk to re-offend.  In particular, he found that Dr. Klassen’s
    explanation for the divergent results cast doubt on the accuracy of the STATIC-99
    instrument.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that the appellant presented a substantial risk to
    re-offend.  The trial judge said that he was satisfied beyond a reasonable
    doubt that the appellant would likely re-offend unless limited by external
    controls:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Finally the uncontradicted evidence of all experts
    was that gerontophilia was causing Mr. Grayer to break and enter the homes
    of elderly women and rape them.  The evidence was also uncontradicted that
    gerontophilia could not be cured.  If Mr. Grayer was not able to control
    his gerontophilia over the past 15 years, absent any external controls, there
    would be no reason to conclude that he could control his sexual impulses
    in the future.  I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that absent any
    external controls there is a likelihood that Dayle Grayer would commit similar
    offences in the future.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then turned his attention to the long-term offender provisions
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and in particular whether the appellant’s risk
    of future re-offending was capable of control in the community in accordance
    with s. 753.1(1)(c) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Section 753.1(1) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The court may, on application made under this Part
    following the filing of an assessment report under subsection 752.1(2), find
    an offender to be a long-term offender if it is satisfied that</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)       it would be appropriate to impose a sentence
    of imprisonment of two years or more for the offence for which the offender
    has been convicted;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)       there is a substantial risk that the
    offender will re-offend; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)       there is a reasonable possibility of
    eventual control of the risk in the community.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his consideration of whether the appellant’s risk of re-offending could be
    controlled within the community, the trial judge considered four possible
    control factors that had been raised by the expert witnesses: psychological
    treatment, pharmacological treatment, supervision and age.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that the appellant was not a candidate for psychological
    treatment.  Such treatment is founded on the premise that the appellant accepted
    his guilt and has a desire to change.  The trial judge observed that the
    appellant had denied his guilt before the jury.  The trial judge found that
    his subsequent acknowledgement of guilt at the time of the dangerous offender
    application was “not very convincing”.  The trial judge accepted Dr. Klassen’s
    evidence that psychological treatment would not be helpful.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect of pharmacological treatment, the trial judge accepted the concerns
    of both Dr. Klassen and Dr. Gojer in regard to such treatment.  These concerns
    included:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)        pharmacological treatment interferes
    with normal sex life;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)       the correct dose is dependent upon feedback
    from the appellant;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii)     there are side effects which could be
    real or concocted;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iv)      whether the Parole Board would order
    the drug treatment if there were side effects;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(v)       whether the appellant would consent to
    such treatment while under supervision and subsequent to his release;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(vi)      whether the court had authority to order
    drug treatment or only to recommend it to the Parole Board.  Dr. Gojer testified
    that the court could not order drug treatment and Dr. Klassen testified that
    he was unaware of the Parole Board using drug treatment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge, in his consideration of supervision in the community, commented
    that Dr. Gojer had testified that the appellant’s risk could be managed in
    the community if there was a sex offender counselling programme, daily monitoring
    and spot checks, a stable residence and a judicious use of drugs.  The trial
    judge observed that Dr. Gojer did not testify as to how such supervision
    could be carried out in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Essex
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    County.  There was no evidence as to the type of counselling programmes available
    or where a stable residence would be.  Members of the appellant’s immediate
    family were present in court during the trial and the dangerous offender
    hearing.  However, no family members testified as to the degree of supervision
    and support that they could offer.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect of age, the trial judge made reference to both the evidence of Dr.
    Klassen and Dr. Gojer on this issue.  He observed that both Dr. Klassen and
    Dr. Gojer testified that a combination of drugs and age would substantially
    reduce the appellant’s risk of re-offending.  He commented on Dr. Klassen’s
    evidence to the effect that it was rare to find males over 50 years of age
    commit violent sexual offences against adult women.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that there was not a reasonable possibility of eventual
    control of the appellant’s risk to re-offend in the community.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, the trial judge declined to make a long-term offender order.  He
    concluded that the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the criteria
    for a dangerous offender designation had been established. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raises several grounds of appeal.  Some of the grounds are over-lapping
    and they are broken down into a number of sub-grounds.  For ease of analysis,
    the grounds of appeal can be summarized as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge misconstrued and misapplied the expert evidence as it related
    to the assessment of the risk to re-offend.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge erred in his appreciation and appli-cation of the pharmacological
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge erred in rejecting the impact of super-visory and treatment resources
    on the appellant’s risk to re-offend.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iv)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge erred in failing to consider the impact that age and the passage
    of time would have on the appellant’s risk to re-offend.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>(i)        Did the trial judge misconstrue and misapply the expert
      evidence as it related to the assessment of the risk to re-offend? </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his original report, Dr. Klassen had said that the appellant represented
    a 58% chance to re-offend over seven years and a 76% chance to re-offend
    over 15 years.  The trial judge accepted these figures in his reasons for
    judgment.  The trial judge apparently overlooked the fact that Dr. Klassen
    changed his mind when he testified.  As stated above, the higher SORAG risk
    percentages were calculated on the premise that the appellant suffered from
    a personality disorder.  In his evidence, he said that although he suspected
    that the appellant suffered from a personality disorder, he was unable to
    prove it.  He therefore concluded that the appellant represented a 59% risk
    to offend over 15 years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the appellant submitted that the SORAG scores should have been excluded
    or at least approached with caution because they took into account charges
    in addition to convictions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the appellant was critical of Dr. Klassen as an expert witness because
    he could not give a working definition of actuarial science.  Dr. Klassen
    admitted that actuarial science was not his field.  Counsel for the appellant
    submitted that the trial judge failed to consider the evidence of the only
    witness knowledgeable in actuarial science, Dr. Palmer.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the appellant provided a detailed review of the actuarial evidence, including
    an analysis of its strength and weaknesses and the differing views of each
    of the expert witnesses.  All of this analysis was advanced in order to persuade
    this court that the trial judge had erred in preferring the evidence of Dr.
    Klassen over the evidence of Dr. Gojer and Dr. Palmer.  In reality, counsel
    was urging us to retry the case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fact that the trial judge appears to have overlooked the lower SORAG score,
    obtained by Dr. Klassen, is cause for concern.  However, the bottom line
    of the evidence of both psychiatrists was that the appellant was a moderate
    risk to re-offend.  Dr. Gojer, the psychiatrist called as a witness by the
    appellant, was unequivocal in his conclusion that the appellant represented
    a substantial risk to re-offend, based on his actuarial score and on his
    clinical diagnosis of paraphilia.  The trial judge accepted that evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the trial judge properly considered that the SORAG instrument takes
    into account criminal charges in addition to criminal convictions.  The trial
    judge adverted to the evidence of Dr. Klassen that actuarial tests have their
    limitations.  I also note the submission of counsel for the respondent, with
    which I agree, that the information considered by psychiatrists in rendering
    an opinion of risk assessment is not limited to information which would be
    admissible as evidence in a criminal trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the fact that actuarial science was not Dr. Klassen’s field is of
    no moment.  The actuarial instruments were used to assist in assessing the
    appellant’s risk to re-offend.  Each of the experts emphasized their various
    limitations.  Dr. Palmer, a witness called by the appellant and to whom the
    appellant said the trial judge should have paid greater attention because
    of his actuarial expertise, made the following statement in his report, which
    he confirmed in his evidence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I believe Dr. Klassen’s comment that “Mr. Grayer
    is likely at moderate risk of re-offence, from an actuarial perspective” reflects
    the most appropriate reconciliation of the divergent estimates [as between
    the GSIR, the SORAG and the STATIC-99].   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is clear that the trial judge placed great weight on the conclusions of Dr.
    Klassen concerning the appellant’s risk to re-offend.  This is not surprising
    since it was only Dr. Klassen who actually met the appellant. It is also
    not surprising in view of the fact that both Dr. Gojer and Dr. Palmer relied
    upon the report and evidence of Dr. Klassen in coming to their own conclusions.  While
    the detailed analysis by appellant’s counsel of the expert evidence could
    have led the trial judge to another conclusion, I do not believe that it
    is open to this court to come to any different conclusion.  In order to do
    so, we would be accepting the invitation to re-try the case.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>(ii)      Did the trial judge err in his appreciation and

    reducing drugs as a factor in assessing the appellant’s risk to the community.  Counsel
    further submitted that the trial judge erred in his review of Dr. Klassen’s
    evidence concerning the appellant’s hostility to authority.  The trial judge
    stated that the appellant’s hostility made him a poor candidate for pharmacological
    treatment when in fact Dr. Klassen had referred to psychological treatment.  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the trial judge made no error in his consideration and appreciation
    of the use that could be made of sex drive reducing drugs in respect of the
    appellant.  The trial judge made express reference to the evidence of Dr.
    Klassen and Dr. Gojer in respect of the use of drugs such as Lupron, which
    have the capacity to reduce the appellant’s sex drive and thereby reduce
    his risk of re-offending in the community.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not regard the trial judge’s reference to the appellant’s hostility to
    authority and pharmacological treatment, which the appellant submits should
    instead have been attributed to psychological treatment, as material.  Common
    sense would suggest that the appellant’s hostility to authority would be
    relevant to whether he is a reasonable candidate for drug treatment as well
    as psychological treatment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the appellant was released in the community as a long-term offender, the
    terms of his release would be fixed by the National Parole Board pursuant
    to the provisions of Part II of the <i>Corrections and Conditional Release
    Act</i>, S.C. 1992, c. 20. During the testimony of both Dr. Klassen and Dr.
    Gojer, there was discussion as to whether the Board would or could impose
    mandatory drug treatment on the appellant.  The discussion is reflected in
    the reasons of the trial judge.  Counsel for the appellant submitted that

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place

    the Superior Court has considered this issue in a most helpful and thorough
    judgment in <i>R. v. Payne</i> (2001), 41 C.R. (5th) 156 at para. 138:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[A]n offender on conditional release by way of
    a long-term supervision order may be compelled by a term of the order to
    undertake treatment and related pharmaceutical intervention where essential
    to management of the accused’s risk of reoffending.  In other words, the
    offender’s consent to such a condition is not required.  Should the offender
    breach terms of the order respecting treatment or medication, he or she is
    subject to apprehension with suspension of the order pursuant to s. 135.1
    of the <i>Act</i> or to arrest and prosecution pursuant to s. 753.3(1) of
    the <i>Code</i>.  The entire object of the long-term offender regime would
    be undermined by providing the offender the ability to defeat risk management.  Accordingly,
    mandatory treatment and medication conditions in an order are a proportionate
    response to protecting the public from a person who, by definition, is a
    substantial risk to reoffend. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the respondent concedes that a mandatory condition for drug treatment
    could be imposed by the National Parole Board upon a long-term offender.  The
    Crown also concedes that the trial judge may not have appreciated this to
    be the case.  On the view I take of this case, I do not find it necessary
    to decide this issue.  Whatever the state of the law, this is not a case
    to recommend or to order pharmacological treatment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is apparent that the co-operation of the appellant would be essential if
    he was to be a candidate for drug treatment.  The appellant’s co-operation
    in arriving at his proper dosage and in assessing its side effects is required.  The
    trial judge stated that he accepted Dr. Klassen’s evidence that the appellant
    was hostile to authority.  He also found that the appellant’s “admission
    of guilt and desire to change [were] not sincere.”  In my view, if the trial
    judge had approached this matter on the basis that he could combine a long-term
    offender designation with a recommendation for mandatory drug treatment to
    the National Parole Board, as a condition of his release to the community,
    he would not have done so.  The trial judge’s findings show that such a recommendation
    would not likely be effective and is not justified. </p>

lang=EN-US>(iii)     Did the trial judge err in rejecting the impact of supervisory
      and treatment resources on the appellant’s risk to re-offend?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge referred to Dr. Gojer’s evidence concerning the management of
    the appellant’s risk to re-offend in the community.  As referred to above,
    Dr. Gojer testified that the risk could only be managed in the community
    provided that the appellant was involved in a sex counselling programme,
    daily monitoring and spot checks, a stable residence and a judicious use
    of drugs.  The trial judge observed that there was no evidence concerning
    the type of counselling programmes available in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Essex
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    County and no evidence as to who would do the daily monitoring and spot checks.  The
    trial judge did not think that the appellant’s family would be helpful in
    his supervision as was suggested by the appellant’s counsel at trial.  The
    trial judge also observed that Dr. Klassen testified that the appellant would
    have to admit his guilt for psychological treatment to be of benefit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this appeal, counsel for the appellant made an application to admit fresh
    evidence.  The fresh evidence provided information concerning services that
    were available through the Windsor Area Parole Office to supervise long-term
    offenders’
    reintegration into the community.  The services outlined in the fresh evidence
    included sex offender treatment, available residential facilities, anger
    management programming, psychological counselling, medical resources for
    the provision of sex drive reducing medication, the performance of spot checks
    and home visits by parole officers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None
    of the fresh evidence deals directly with the particular circumstances of
    the appellant.  However, of greater significance is the fact that, other
    than the brief statement made by the appellant at the conclusion of the dangerous
    offender application, there is no evidence or information that the appellant
    would be agreeable to involving himself in a community-based programme which
    would be closely supervised.  While I accept that there is no onus on the
    appellant to offer evidence, either at trial or on appeal on these issues,
    in the absence of evidence from the appellant, we are left with the evidence
    at the hearing of the appellant’s hostile and non-cooperative attitude.  To
    conclude that the appellant is a suitable candidate for supervision within
    the community because the Windsor Parole Office has access to a wide range
    of services would be speculative at best.  Much more than speculation is
    required to satisfy the court that the appellant’s risk to re-offend could
    be managed in the community.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R.
      v. Levesque</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 487 at para. 16, the Supreme Court held, “Although
      the rules concerning sources and types of evidence are more flexible in
      respect of sentence, the criteria for admitting fresh evidence on appeal
      are the same, regardless of whether the appeal relates to a verdict or
      a sentence.” The principles for admitting fresh evidence were articulated
      in the seminal case of <i>R. v. Palmer</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759 at 775:</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due diligence, it could
    have been adduced at trial provided that this general principle will not
    be applied as strictly in a criminal case as in civil cases: see <i>McMartin
    v. The Queen</i>. [Citation omitted.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the fresh evidence proffered by counsel for the appellant does not
    satisfy the fourth principle in <i>Palmer</i>.  The fresh evidence could
    not reasonably have affected the result in view of the finding of the trial
    judge concerning the hostile and non-cooperative attitude of the appellant.</p>

    is important, as this court and the British Columbia Court of Appeal have
    previously said, to bear in mind that the test under s. 753.1(1)(c) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> is whether “there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control
    of the risk in the community.”  The French version of the subsection calls
    for “une possibilité réelle”.  I adopt the following excerpt from the reasons
    of Feldman J.A. in <i>R. v. McCallum</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 1178 at para. 47:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Case law from this court and from the British Columbia
    Court of Appeal under the former dangerous offender legislation and the amended
    provisions has held that in order to achieve the goal of protection of the
    public under the dangerous offender and long-term offender provisions, there
    must be evidence of treatability that is more than an expression of hope
    and that indicates that the specific offender can be treated within a definite
    period of time: <i>R. v. Poutsoungas</i> (1989), 49 C.C.C. (3d) 388 (Ont.
    C.A.); <i>R. v. Higginbottom</i> (2001), 156 C.C.C. (3d) 178 (Ont. C.A.).  In <i>R.
    v. M.(J.S.)</i> (2003), 173 C.C.C. (3d) 75 (B.C.C.A.), the court stated that
    the basic purpose of the dangerous offender provision before the 1997 amendment
    was the protection of the public and that under the amended legislation,
    the test for achieving that goal is set out in s. 753.1(1)(c), namely, whether
    there is a reasonable possibility of control in the community of the risk
    of the offender re-offending.  The court also noted that the French version
    of the section requires “une possibilité réelle”, or a “real possibility”,
    which may require an even higher degree of certainty in the evidence than
    the English version, a “reasonable possibility”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am unable to conclude that the trial judge erred in rejecting the impact
    of the supervisory and treatment resources on the appellant’s risk to re-offend.  The
    additional fresh evidence does not assist.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>(iv)      Did the trial judge err in failing to consider the impact
      that age and the passage of time would have on the appellant’s risk to

    discussed above, Dr. Klassen testified that there is a significant decline
    in a person’s sex drive in his sixth decade.  However, it is not possible
    to predict with precision when the decline may occur.  Dr. Gojer, who was
    called as a witness for the appellant, confirmed the evidence of Dr. Klassen.  Dr.
    Gojer also testified that from a clinical perspective, he expected the appellant’s
    pattern of offending would continue until at least his mid-fifties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the appellant submits that the trial judge failed to deal adequately

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    references to age in the reasons for judgment are sparse and there is little,
    if any, analysis as it relates to the appellant.  However, the trial judge
    referred to the evidence of Dr. Klassen and Dr. Gojer in respect of when
    a decline in sexual drive is likely to occur and the impossibility of accurately
    assessing the time of its onset in a particular individual, including the
    appellant.  While the trial judge’s reasons are limited in relation to this
    issue, they do make it clear that the trial judge turned his mind to the
    question of age.  It is apparent that the trial judge considered age in relation
    to all of the factors that were relevant to the control of the appellant’s
    risk within the community and concluded that, at the age of 46 years, the
    appellant was not a candidate for designation as a long-term offender and
    eventual release into the community.  No doubt as time passes, the appellant
    will have an opportunity to raise this issue before the National Parole Board.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
