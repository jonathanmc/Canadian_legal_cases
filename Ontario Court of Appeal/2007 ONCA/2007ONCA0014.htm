      of Justice Ted Matlow of the Superior Court of Justice, dated August 23,

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is an appeal from a decision of Matlow J. that found the appellant, Jones
    Heward Investment Counsel Inc. (Jones Heward), a portfolio manager, liable
    for its partial mismanagement of investments on behalf of the respondent,
    2878852 Canada Inc. (2878852).  Although the trial judge dismissed the claim
    against the individual portfolio manager, Marshall Nicholishen, and the main
    part of the respondent’s claim, which alleged negligence in regard to the
    entirety of the account, he found that the appellant had mismanaged the respondent’s
    account in two respects.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    two instances of mismanagement involved Jones Heward’s retention of a significant
    portion of the respondent’s account in short-term investments for a period
    of twenty-two months (resulting in a loss of $919,439) and its investment
    on behalf of the respondent in a stock called Kazakhstan Minerals Corporation
    (Kazakhstan) (resulting in a loss of $100,865.41).  From this combined award
    of $1,020,304.41, the trial judge deducted $102,830.37 representing professional
    fees for 1998 that the respondent had not paid Jones Heward.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal relates only to the two instances of mismanagement and, specifically,
    the trial judge’s findings with respect to the short-term and
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Kazakhstan</st1:country-region>
    investments (collectively, the disputed investments).  The challenge rests
    on the appellant’s allegation of inconsistent factual findings by the trial
    judge. In addition, the appellant challenges the judgment because it does
    not address the issues of ratification, mitigation, contributory negligence
    and the allocation of the respondent’s losses against his profits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I will discuss, appellate review was not assisted by the trial judge’s decision
    to incorporate large portions of the parties’ facta into his reasons.  Nonetheless,
    I see no basis on which to overturn the trial judge’s factual and credibility
    findings, which were available to him on the evidence.  I would also dismiss
    the challenge to the award on the issues of ratification, mitigation, contributory
    negligence and allocation of loss.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Issues</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge erred: </p>
  <p>1.         in providing reasons that were an inadequate
    basis for the purposes of appellate review;</p>
  <p>2.         in finding the appellant negligent in
    its management of the short-term investments;</p>
  <p>3.         in finding the appellant negligent in
    the acquisition and maintenance of the

  <p>5.         in his assessment of damages by failing
    to take into account mitigation and contributory negligence; and</p>
  <p>6.         in not offsetting the respondent’s losses against his overall

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Background</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2878852
    is a holding company used as an investment vehicle by its sole shareholder,
    Jean Dupéré (collectively, the respondent or 2878852).  Mr. Dupéré first
    placed $5.5 million for investment with Jones Heward pursuant to a letter
    agreement signed in February 1993.  The letter agreement gave Jones Heward
    authority “to make and implement investment decisions for our account as
    you, in your discretion, deem proper and advisable from time to time”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    agreement also relieved Jones Heward of liability
    “for any error of judgment or any other act or omission provided” that Jones
    Heward acted “in good faith” and exercised “due care”.  Although the trial
    decision does not turn on the nature of their relationship, Jones Heward
    conceded at trial that the circumstances of this discretionary account placed
    it in a fiduciary relationship with 2878852. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Dupéré received quarterly and monthly statements regarding the account. Mr.
    Nicholishen was the appellant’s chair, vice president, and senior portfolio
    manager, and the respondent’s portfolio manager. Mr. Nicholishen, or another
    Jones Heward representative, met annually with Mr. Dupéré and periodically
    reviewed his investments in telephone calls and other communications.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    2878852 was more than satisfied with the performance of its portfolio during
    Jones Heward’s first three years of stewardship, it deposited a further $14.4
    million into the portfolio in January 1996.  Throughout the balance of 1996,
    and until Jones Heward terminated the account in December 1998, more than
    thirty to forty per cent of the respondent’s portfolio was retained in short-term
    investments.  This was the basis for one of 2878852’s complaints.  The second
    arose from the March 1996 purchase of shares in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Kazakhstan</st1:country-region>
    , a mining and natural resource company, at a cost of $89,396, which were
    sold in September 1997 with a capital loss of $83,213.29.  Despite the losses
    on the two disputed investments, 2878852’s portfolio earned an overall profit
    of about $8.2 million, representing an annual rate of return of 10.7%.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    2878852 opened the account in 1993, the respondent and Jones Heward agreed
    on a balanced-growth portfolio, with the objectives of safeguarding assets
    while generating income and growth.  To meet these objectives, Jones Heward
    invested the respondent’s funds in accordance with its balanced growth model
    portfolio (model portfolio).  The model portfolio, which it applied to each
    of its clients’ accounts, included a component for speculative investment
    in smaller companies, provided that such an investment fit within principled
    parameters and the portfolio objectives.  As well, Jones Heward’s investment
    strategy called for retaining no more than five to eight per cent of the
    account in cash or short-term investments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Over
    the lifetime of the account, Jones Heward invested in 159 stocks on behalf
    of 2878852.  Towards the latter part of the relationship, Mr. Dupéré came
    to regard many of the Jones Heward investments as speculative and as contrary
    to what he recalled as an agreed-upon investment strategy of investing in
    blue chip stocks.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the respondent and the appellant were unable to resolve their differences,
    Jones Heward terminated 2878852’s account in December 1998.  2878852 launched
    this action claiming damages of $7 million.  Since Mr. Dupéré died unexpectedly
    after discovery, portions of his discovery were read in on consent at trial. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The trial decision</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his reasons, the trial judge noted Jones Heward’s denial of overall negligence,
    with the “relatively minor exception”
    that Jones Heward “conceded … and supported by their expert witness, John
    Priestman, that shares of Kazakhstan Minerals Corporation … should not have
    been purchased.”  The reasons for judgment contain no further analysis of
    the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Kazakhstan</st1:country-region>
    claim.  The trial judge also noted Jones Heward’s position that its retention
    of large sums of short-term investments was done on Mr. Dupéré’s express
    oral instructions, instructions that Mr. Dupéré
    denied.  On the counterclaim, Mr. Dupéré
    took the position that Jones Heward waived its 1998 fees as a “conciliatory
    gesture”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Credibility
    was a significant issue at this seventeen-day trial. Mr. Dupéré’s premature
    death and the enforced reliance on his discovery raised acknowledged difficulties,
    which the trial judge was satisfied were substantially overcome by the numerous
    volumes of filed documents. Importantly, the trial judge dismissed the main
    claim largely on the basis of Mr. Dupéré’s own evidence and allowed the partial
    claim largely on the basis of the Jones Heward evidence, much of which lacked
    consistency. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the basis of the evidence he accepted, and contrary to Mr. Dupéré’s evidence
    about a blue chip investment strategy, the trial judge concluded that Jones
    Heward and 2878852 agreed to the investments in accordance with Jones Heward’s
    model portfolio.  With the exception of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Kazakhstan</st1:country-region>
    , the trial judge concluded that Jones Heward did not breach that agreement
    and acted honestly, “in good faith and without negligence.”  In any event,
    the trial judge would have relieved Jones Heward from liability on the main
    claim on the basis of the release clause in the letter agreement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    arriving at his conclusion, the trial judge rejected the opinion of the respondent’s
    expert, that nineteen of the stocks in the respondent’s portfolio were unsuitable,
    because he found the expert’s evidence to be vague, “based on questionable
    sources and unreliable information” and an incorrect factual foundation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge preferred the evidence of the Jones Heward expert, John Priestman,
    whom, he found, had a much better understanding of the facts and the concept
    of the model portfolio.  He accepted Mr. Priestman’s evidence that, with
    the exception of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Kazakhstan</st1:country-region>
    , the appellant performed in accordance with the letter agreement and model
    portfolio and did a good job for the respondent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    a finding of fact, the trial judge determined that Mr. Dupéré was a sophisticated
    and experienced businessperson and investor who understood how his account
    was being managed and brought his claim as an attempt to retain profits and
    be relieved of losses.  Although Mr. Dupéré occasionally complained about
    particular investments, he accepted the appellant’s assurances and did not
    reduce his complaints to writing until February 1998. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the issue of the claim for inappropriate maintenance of short-term investments,
    the trial judge gave these reasons:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[20] I turn now to that part of the plaintiff’s
    claim that arises out of the defendant’s retaining excessive amount of cash
    in the plaintiff’s account.  I am persuaded on a balance of probability that
    between March 1, 1996, and December 31, 1997, the defendant allowed accumulations
    of cash to remain in the plaintiff’s account in amounts far exceeding 8%
    of the total market value of the account, the maximum that should reasonably
    be maintained in the absence of special circumstances which are not present
    in this case.  The defendant’s explanation for allowing this to occur, according
    to Nicholishen, was that Dupéré had instructed him to do so because Dupéré anticipated
    the need for a large amount of cash being available to complete a transaction
    which he expected to take place a short time later.  On all of the evidence,
    I consider it unlikely that Dupéré ever gave such instructions.  I find that
    Nicholishen’s evidence, and the evidence of the other employees of the defendant
    who corroborated it, was likely untrue.  If Dupéré had given such instructions,
    the defendant should have, and likely would have, required Dupéré to give
    them in writing and he did not.  Nor did the defendant record the receipt
    of such instructions from Dupéré in its own records.  Even if Dupéré had
    given such instructions, the defendant ought to have checked with him from
    time to ascertain whether the anticipated transaction was still likely to
    occur imminently or, if not, whether more cash ought to be invested and it
    did not.  There was no advantage to the plaintiff to keep excessively large
    sums of cash on hand in its account on which fees were payable to the defendant.  It
    could easily have invested those sums on its own without any disadvantage.  I
    find, therefore, that the defendant’s default was likely the result of an
    oversight which, in the circumstances, amounted to negligence and a breach
    of the agreement which required the defendant “to exercise due care” as a
    condition of avoiding liability.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[21] The evidence is in conflict as to whether
    or not Dupéré complained to the defendant about the excessively large sums
    of cash maintained in the plaintiff’s account.  Dupéré stated that he raised
    this issue whereas Nicholishen and other defence witnesses denied it.  I
    accept Dupéré’s evidence on this issue.  The defendant’s default was glaring
    and resulted in large financial consequences for the plaintiff.  It is inconceivable
    that Dupéré would not have noticed what was going on from his examination
    of the reporting statements he received and it is inconceivable that he would
    not have complained.  Dupéré’s conduct should not excuse the defendant’s
    default or bar the plaintiff’s entitlement to relief.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have said, in addition to his written reasons, the trial judge adopted
    by reference numerous paragraphs of the parties’ written submissions, including
    the respondent’s submissions regarding the inconsistencies in the evidence
    given by the Jones Heward witnesses.  He accepted that Mr. Dupéré complained
    about the high levels of cash in his account “throughout 1996 and 1997”,
    including at an April 1997 meeting.  The trial judge adopted the appellant’s
    submissions about Mr. Dupéré’s sophistication as an investor and his knowledge
    of the types of investment permitted within the model portfolio, including
    some investment in “speculative stocks”, that Jones Heward followed an investment
    discipline for every security purchased, that Jones Heward reported frequently
    and regularly to 2878852 and that Mr. Dupéré
    discussed specific securities with Jones Heward from time to time.  Finally,
    he accepted the submissions that Mr. Dupéré owed Jones Heward $102,830.37
    for 1998 fees and that the parties had never reached an agreement under which
    Jones Heward would forgive any of those fees. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the basis of this background and the reasons given by the trial judge, I
    address the issues raised by the parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Analysis</b></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>1.         The sufficiency

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unquestionably,
    the trial judge’s decision to incorporate parts of the parties’ written argument
    into his reasons was ill-advised and unfortunate.  In my view, a trial judge’s
    reasons should be comprehensive on their own and, absent exceptional circumstances,
    should not simply incorporate, by reference to particular paragraph numbers,
    portions of the parties’ facta or written submissions.  In part, this adoption
    by reference of the parties’ positions led to this appeal because the findings
    in the main body of the trial judge’s reasons were inconsistent with the
    paragraphs of the written argument that he adopted. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    example, in the main part of his reasons, the trial judge concluded that
    Jones Heward’s acquisition of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Kazakhstan</st1:country-region>
    did not conform to its model portfolio.  However, the trial judge also adopted
    Jones Heward’s written argument that maintained that all stocks, including
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">

    on a fair and common sense reading of the reasons as a whole, it is clear
    that the trial judge meant that he was dismissing the main part of the respondent’s
    action because Jones Heward invested the respondent’s funds within the parameters
    of the model portfolio, with the important exceptions of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">

'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    essence, the appellant’s argument on appeal attempts to impugn the trial
    judge’s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses.  The evidence from
    Mr. Nicholishen, and others at Jones Heward, was to the effect that the respondent
    agreed to give the appellant the discretion to manage its funds in accordance
    with the model portfolio and Jones Heward complied with those instructions.  It
    was Jones Heward’s position that
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Kazakhstan</st1:country-region>
    fit within the parameters of the model portfolio and that a large percentage
    of cash retained in the portfolio was an exception to its usual investment
    strategy but made at the express oral instructions of the respondent.  Further,
    the appellant argued that its internal safeguards acted to mandate a regular
    review of the account, that it was cognizant at all times of the large cash
    holdings, that those holdings were discussed periodically among Jones Heward
    staff, including its compliance officer, and that the appellant continued
    its instruction to maintain this liquidity.  The appellant argued that, since
    the trial judge clearly accepted the Jones Heward evidence on the main complaint
    and rejected the respondent’s evidence about a blue chip investment strategy,
    it was unreasonable for the trial judge to reject the Jones Heward evidence
    about the disputed investments and to prefer the respondent’s evidence on
    those two investments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    in my view, the trial judge adequately explained his credibility findings
    by his reliance on the documents and his explanation that “Dupéré’s own evidence
    contributed much to my ultimate conclusion to dismiss a large part of the
    [appellant’s] claim and the evidence of some of the [respondent’s] witnesses
    contributed much to my ultimate conclusion to allow another part.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    fair reading of the reasons in their entirety supports the conclusion that,
    as he was entitled to do, the trial judge simply believed some of Mr. Dupéré’s
    evidence and some of Jones Heward’s evidence.  Even though Mr. Dupéré
    testified that he instructed Jones Heward to invest in blue chip investments
    only, this evidence was contradicted both by the Jones Heward testimony and
    by the documents, including the letter agreement. In other words, Mr. Dupéré’s
    evidence was not credible regarding his main claim.  On the other hand, the
    significant inconsistencies in the Jones Heward evidence regarding the disputed
    investments affected its credibility.  In these circumstances, the trial
    judge was entitled to reject the Jones Heward evidence as he did and to prefer
    that of Mr. Dupéré, confirmed as it was by the documentary evidence and the
    evidence of the appellant’s own expert with respect to

    will deal with the specific concerns raised about the trial judge’s findings
    in more detail as I discuss the grounds of appeal particular to the disputed
    investments.  However, as a general statement, a trial judge’s reasons are
    sufficient and meet the test set out in <i>R. v. Sheppard</i>, [2002] S.C.R.
    869, as discussed in the civil context in <i>Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
    Pension Plan (Trustee of) v. BF Realty Holdings Ltd.</i>, [2002] O.J. No.
    2125 (C.A.) at para. 64 when, reading the reasons as a whole, the trial judge
    is shown to have considered the evidence in its totality in relation to the
    ultimate issue and the reasons allow for adequate appellate review because
    they provide an understanding for the basis of the trial judge’s decision.  In
    my view, although the reasons in this case lack detail, they are sufficient
    to ascertain how the trial judge arrived at his decision.</p>

    Heward conceded that it retained a minimum of thirty per cent of the respondent’s
    portfolio in short-term investments for about twenty-two months from January
    1996 to December 1997.  This portion of the portfolio, which had a rate of
    return of five to six per cent over that period, was comprised of twenty-one
    short-term investments including guaranteed investment certificates, treasury
    bills, high grade commercial paper, banker’s acceptances and small amounts
    of cash.  The parties were in agreement that no more than eight per cent
    of a portfolio is usually maintained in such investments, absent special
    circumstances or instructions, and that the large percentages retained in
    this case were not in compliance with Jones Heward’s own approach to investment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Nicholishen testified that this non-compliance conformed to express oral
    instructions given by Mr. Dupéré to maintain liquidity in anticipation of
    his need for funds.  He also testified that the quantum of short-term investments
    was obvious to Mr. Dupéré from all their communications. Jones Heward, said
    Mr. Nicholishen, was mindful of the unusual liquidity of the account because
    the issue was “constantly raised” among members of the portfolio team and
    because these investments were actively managed.  Furthermore, the Jones
    Heward witnesses testified that Mr. Dupéré did not complain about the short-term
    investments during frequent conversations and meetings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Jones Heward witnesses included five of Mr. Nicholishen’s co-workers, none
    of whom were privy to receiving the alleged initial instructions for increased
    liquidity and only one of whom testified that he discussed that liquidity
    with Mr. Dupéré.  The Jones Heward witnesses gave evidence that was inconsistent
    with each other and inconsistent with the answers they individually gave
    years earlier in discovery and in answers to undertakings.  Furthermore,
    their evidence was undermined by the lack of documentary support, including
    a failure to produce spreadsheets Jones Heward had allegedly used at quarterly
    meetings to identify investments not in conformity with its investment strategies.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    contrast, Mr. Dupéré denied giving instructions to maintain unusual proportions
    of short-term investments and testified that he repeatedly complained about
    those proportions.  His evidence was supported by Jones Heward’s failure
    to record any liquidity instructions in its files, the absence of any exception
    reports, and a failure by Jones Heward to confirm in writing Mr. Dupéré’s
    supposed instructions.  The trial judge preferred Mr. Dupéré’s evidence on
    these points, because, as is implicit in his reasons, the Jones Heward witnesses
    were not credible.  </p>

    repeat that it would have been preferable had the trial judge recorded his
    specific findings on the inconsistencies of the witnesses.  However, it is
    clear that the trial judge was entitled to accept some but not all of the
    evidence of any witness and he had ample reason to reject much of the Jones
    Heward evidence.  In this sense, the trial judge made no error in finding
    the Jones Heward evidence “likely untrue”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant takes issue with the trial judge’s reasons in two other respects:
    first, the trial judge did not address evidence that Mr. Dupéré maintained
    significant cash investments in a different account managed by the firm of
    Jarislowsky Fraser and, second, the trial judge characterized Jones Heward’s
    negligence as an “oversight”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the evidence regarding the Jarislowsky Fraser account established only that
    Mr. Dupéré was surprised to learn that this account contained cash levels
    in excess of five per cent.  There was no evidence whatsoever that the Jarislowsky
    Fraser liquidity was maintained at Mr. Dupéré’s instructions; the only evidence
    was that it was not. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s use of the word “oversight” appears to be nothing more than
    an attempt to convey his conclusion that Jones Heward did not deliberately
    set out to mismanage the respondent’s investments.  This is consistent with
    his finding that Jones Heward was not negligent on the main part of the respondent’s
    claim.  The word “oversight” is also consistent with the trial judge’s finding
    that Jones Heward, in the normal course, would have obtained written instructions
    about the unusual liquidity, monitored the portfolio’s non-compliance in
    this regard, periodically reviewed the short-term investment percentage with
    the respondent and noted any instructions to maintain such liquidity.  It
    followed none of these procedures.  Thus, he concluded that Jones Heward’s
    negligence was in the nature of an “oversight” in the sense that it was not
    a deliberate decision to invest in a manner inconsistent with the client’s
    instructions.</p>

  <h3><b>4.         Ratification</b></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge did not consider the defence of ratification
    and that, if he had, he would have concluded that Mr. Dupéré, by his conduct,
    ratified the disputed investments. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree.  One of the central issues at the trial was whether Mr. Dupéré ratified
    the acquisitions in his portfolio by his continued dealing with Jones Heward
    in the absence of complaint.  Continued dealing, however, is not determinative
    of the issue.  As Gillese, J.A. said in <i>Hunt v. TD Securities Inc.</i> (2003),
    66 O.R. (3d) 481 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at para. 75: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>While continued dealings may be evidence of ratification,
    it is not determinative. In my view, ratification cannot be implied in the
    face of continuing repudiation even when the investor continues to use the
    broker for other transactions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is true that on the main claim, the trial judge concluded that “for obvious
    reasons” the respondent could not succeed.  He did so because Jones Heward
    frequently communicated with the respondent about the content of its portfolio,
    the respondent agreed to the Jones Heward model portfolio management, and
    it knew the available options if it was “seriously displeased” with Jones
    Heward’s performance.  In addition, the trial judge found that Mr. Dupéré made
    no written complaint about the portfolio until February 1998, and then that
    his complaint was made on the basis of hindsight motivated by a desire to
    keep gains and be relieved from losses.  For these reasons, the trial judge
    held that the respondent’s main claim could not succeed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the trial judge specifically came to the contrary conclusion regarding the
    disputed investments.  On the basis of the evidence before him, he held that
    Mr. Dupéré complained about the short-term investments on a continuing basis.  The
    evidence also established that, when Mr. Dupéré inquired about Kazakhstan,
    and expressed his concern about the difficult circumstances of its geographical
    location at that time, he was assured that the company was a good investment
    given its “great reserves” and that it fit within the Jones Heward model
    portfolio.  Despite Mr. Dupéré’s concern, Jones Heward did not give him the
    information that
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Kazakhstan</st1:country-region>
    was highly speculative and a “terrible stock”.  One cannot ratify what one
    does not know.  Mr. Dupéré did not tacitly, or otherwise by his conduct,
    approve of or acquiesce to the disputed investments in what, importantly,
    was a managed account.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary, the trial judge was entitled to find that the respondent ratified
    the investments at issue in the main claim because those investments complied
    with the agreed-upon model portfolio.  However, the evidence supported his
    finding that the respondent did not ratify the disputed investments. </p>

    appellant challenges the trial judge’s decision on the issue of mitigation
    in circumstances when the disputed investments were held for lengthy periods
    of time.  The issue of mitigation was raised in the appellant’s written submissions
    at trial; however, this issue was not specifically addressed in the trial
    judge’s reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
    an overall reading of the reasons demonstrates that the trial judge was alive
    to the basis of a claim for mitigation because the respondent’s conduct in
    acquiescing to and failing to take steps to change investments was a major
    issue central to the trial.  In my view, the trial judge’s determination
    of mitigation was implicit in his conclusion that Mr. Dupéré’s conduct “should
    not excuse the defendant’s default or bar the plaintiff’s entitlement to
    relief.”  This conclusion provides a complete answer to mitigation, based
    as it is on the trial judge’s finding that the respondent acted reasonably
    by registering ongoing complaints about the short-term investments and relying
    upon the appellant’s unfounded reassurances with respect to the quality of
    the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Kazakhstan</st1:country-region>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    find support for this conclusion in the fact that that the appellant apparently
    did not challenge the final figure given in the expert report on damages.  That
    figure gave the maximum of nine months as a reasonable time for the appellant
    to invest the cash on a gradual basis to the maximum acceptable cash retention
    of eight per cent of the portfolio.  With those generous allowances, the
    expert found the respondent’s loss to be $919,439, a calculation that the
    trial judge said “was not challenged” on any basis, including the basis that
    it should be further reduced for mitigation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,

    the issue anew.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mitigation

    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Kazakhstan</st1:country-region>
    investment because mitigation is based on the reasonableness of the investor’s
    conduct.  It would not be reasonable to expect the respondent to mitigate
    his
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Kazakhstan</st1:country-region>
    losses when Jones Heward consistently reassured him that the investment fit
    within his investment objectives, that it was a good investment, and that
    he should be patient.  This information was inconsistent with the opinion
    of their own expert that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Kazakhstan</st1:country-region>
    was a “terrible stock”.  Had the respondent known that
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Kazakhstan</st1:country-region>
    was a poor investment that fell outside the model portfolio, indeed he would
    have been obliged to mitigate.  In the absence of that information, he had
    no such obligation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    same cannot be said about the short-term investments.  From the outset of
    the second deposit to the account in January 1996, the respondent was aware
    of the unusually high proportion of short-term investments in his portfolio.  He
    complained about this from time to time.  As Gillese J.A. said in <i>Hunt,
    supra</i>, at para. 77, a finding that the respondent did not ratify the
    investments does not mean that the respondent was entitled to do nothing
    and, in effect, speculate at the expense of the investment manager.  Accordingly,
    the question on mitigation of the short-term investments is to determine
    when the respondent reasonably should have realized that Jones Heward was
    not going to address his complaints and should have taken steps to improve
    his return.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    expert evidence established that Jones Heward would reasonably be expected
    to have invested the excessive quantities of short term investments in the
    account to the eight per cent level by November 1996.  As a sophisticated
    and experienced investor, the respondent would have been aware that such
    a delay was to be expected.  When the nine months passed without appropriate
    reduction of the cash component, the respondent was obliged to complain within
    a reasonable time.  The duration of that reasonable time depends upon a number
    of factors. </p>

    a reasonable period of time for the client to act and mitigate the damages” considering “the

    of trust that is characteristic of a contract of mandate” must be considered
    because a client might be unable or reluctant to believe an investment professional
    invested with significant trust has acted with incompetence.  As a consequence,
    the investor might be slow to realize the extent of the damages and to take

      para. 97 that the following factors warrant consideration in determining
      the reasonableness of the mitigation period: </p>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='
text-align:justify'>1.         the ease of purchase of replacement shares (considering
    the number of shares to be purchased, whether they are readily available
    in the market, and the time and risk involved in their purchase);</p>
  <p>2.         the degree of sophistication and experience of the investor;</p>
  <p>3.         the degree of trust reposed in the broker;</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='
text-align:justify'>4.         whether the broker was obliged to follow the investor's
    instructions in making transactions, and</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='
text-align:justify'>5.         whether the relationship between the investor
    and broker has broken down to the point that the client has lost confidence
    in the broker.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying
    those factors to the respondent’s circumstances in support of the respondent’s
    obligation to mitigate, it is clear that the short-term investments could
    easily have been invested in securities within the model portfolio. As well,
    indisputably, the respondent was a sophisticated investor who, on his own
    admission, recognized that the proportion of his short-term investments fell
    well outside the norm. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    on the other side of the equation, the respondent’s account was a discretionary
    one where the very busy respondent retained Jones Heward to make decisions
    on his behalf because it was a portfolio manager with a particular expertise
    in his investment objectives. Subject to the agreed-upon objectives, the
    respondent placed a great deal of trust in Jones Heward to manage the funds
    as it saw fit. The respondent had good reason to have faith in Jones Heward
    because it had managed the respondent’s earlier investments for the preceding
    three years extremely successfully.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent’s trust and faith in Jones Heward was evidenced by its decision
    to invest a further $14.4 million dollars in 1996. This faith or dependence
    serves to lengthen the mitigation period.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    on different occasions throughout the thirteen months at issue, the respondent
    raised the subject of the short-term investments with Jones Heward and understood
    that the monies would be invested.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent’s trust in the appellant is reflected in the action he took when
    he realized that the appellant was not going to address his concerns. Instead
    of finding another portfolio manager, the respondent made a written complaint
    and attempted throughout 1998 to work with Jones Heward to resolve their
    differences and to continue their relationship.  So did Jones Heward. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jones
    Heward only terminated the relationship after the parties had tried to resolve
    their differences for a further twelve months.  If Jones Heward thought that
    twelve months was a reasonable amount of time to spend in negotiations with
    the respondent, it is difficult for it to complain about the thirteen months
    that the respondent took to make his complaint sufficiently forceful to obtain
    Jones Heward’s focussed attention to the issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    the appellant totally controlled the investments, the respondent completely
    trusted the appellant, the appellant gave the respondent ongoing reassurances,
    the parties enjoyed an ongoing relationship that had not deteriorated, and
    the respondent expressed continuing concerns about the short-term investments,
    I am unable to conclude that the respondent was in a position to act decisively
    or that the thirteen-month period of mitigation was other than reasonable.  Accordingly,
    I would not give effect to the appellant’s appeal on the issue of mitigation.<b> </b></p>

    have had the benefit of reading the thorough reasons for judgment of my colleague
    Lang J.A.  However, for the reasons that follow, I am unable to agree with

    issues on which judgment was granted to the respondent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    turning to these issues, like my colleague, I think the way the trial judge
    put his reasons together must be addressed. The evidence in this trial took
    some seventeen days, concluding on March 19, 2004.  Reasons for judgment
    were released a little over five months later, on August 23, 2004. The reasons
    that provide the trial judge’s thinking on the issues in his own words are
    twenty-three paragraphs long.  In the seven paragraphs that follow, the trial
    judge offers his explanation for then incorporating into the reasons sixty
    paragraphs of the respondent’s written submissions and an additional forty-five
    paragraphs from the written submissions of the appellant.  Those seven paragraphs
    read as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[24]     I now conclude with some further comments
    about the evidence and the relative brevity of these reasons.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[25]     It is now nearly six months since the
    conclusion of the trial of this action. The pressure of presiding over other
    cases and preparing judgments in more urgent, but not necessarily more important,
    cases has made it impossible for me to give my judgment earlier.  As well,
    in addition to the oral evidence of witnesses, the record in this case includes
    a vast number of documents and it has required a great deal of time to review
    all of the evidence and arrive at a just disposition.  It is now desirable
    that judgment be rendered prior to the expiry, in just a few days, of what
    is now considered to be the acceptable time limit for judgments to be reserved
    in the absence of unusual circumstances.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[26]     As I began to write these reasons, I was
    fortunate to have the closing submissions of both sides before me.  Both
    contained extensive references to the evidence and the inferences that should
    be drawn.  Accordingly, I found myself using those submissions extensively
    and borrowing freely from them.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[27]     In these circumstances, I have therefore
    decided to shorten these reasons by adopting portions of both submissions
    as submitted by counsel rather than by setting out in my own words essentially
    what counsel have already done.  There is nothing to be gained in delaying
    the release of this judgment merely to enable me to rewrite the submissions.  Both
    of them were carefully prepared and, so far as I could ascertain, fairly
    and accurately reflected the evidence that was tendered.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[28]     I adopt and incorporate into these reasons
    the following paragraphs of the submissions made on behalf of the plaintiff;
    134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153,
    154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168,
    169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180 (the reference
    in [para.] (c) at page 75 should be to Nicholishen and not Monahan), 181,
    182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196,
    197, 197A.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[29]     I adopt and incorporate into these reasons
    the following paragraphs of the submissions made on behalf of the defendants;
    3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42,
    43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79,
    80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[30]     I acknowledge and thank all counsel for
    their help throughout this trial.  Their performance, without exception,
    met the highest standard of skill and professionalism.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no doubt that limited, careful, and explained adoption of counsel’s argument
    can sometimes assist reasons for judgment.  That is not this case.  In my
    view the wholesale incorporation here, and the seven paragraphs I have quoted,
    raise three serious concerns about the reasons as a whole. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    they raise the concern that large parts of the judgment were pasted together
    from the thinking of others, to meet the six month guideline for the release
    of judgments, at some cost to full and independent consideration of the case
    by the judge himself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    can be no doubt that both the principle of timely release of judgments and
    the principle of full and independent judicial consideration are vital if
    the parties and the public are to have confidence in the judicial system.  One
    cannot be traded off against the other.  Where a judgment raises that possibility,
    the system is not well served.  Moreover, in this case, there was no need
    for it, given the timing I have described.  The trial judge had three more
    weeks to put his own stamp on the reasons and yet stay within the guidelines.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the manner of incorporation here runs the risk of creating an incoherent
    judgment.  The trial judge provides no guidance about the issues to which
    he thinks the incorporated paragraphs relate.  Nor does he tell us whether
    those incorporated paragraphs that are phrased in the typical language of
    submissions are to be read as judicial findings.  In my view, reasons for
    judgment should leave the reader guessing as little as possible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    as my colleague points out, this case clearly demonstrates the risk inherent
    in this technique of a conflict between the trial judge’s own words and those
    he adopts by incorporation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    problem arises most acutely in the context of the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Kazakhstan</st1:country-region>
    shares issue.  To sustain the trial result on that issue, the respondent
    argues that the trial judge concluded that these shares were not purchased
    in accordance with the appellant’s model equity portfolio. The respondent
    must then explain the direct conflict between that finding and the trial
    judge’s incorporated finding that at all times the appellant operated the
    respondent’s account in accorandance with the same management strategy it
    applied to all clients and in accorandance with its model equity portfolio.  As
    I will discuss, I do not think that circle can be squared in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether
    or not the wholesale incorporation of parts of the parties’ submissions creates
    a fatal flaw in the trial judgment in any particular case, I agree with my
    colleague that it is an ill-advised and unfortunate practice.  It can only
    diminish public confidence in the justice system and weaken the primary mechanism
    through which a judge is accountable, namely his or her reasons for judgment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Beyond
    these concerns about the reasons for judgment, the appellant challenges both
    the findings against it concerning the maintenance in the respondent’s portfolio
    of excess short-term investments and the findings against it concerning the
    purchase of the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Kazakhstan</st1:country-region>
    shares.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent does not cross-appeal from the dismissal of its main claim that
    the appellant purchased a number of corporate stocks for its portfolio that
    it should not have.  As my colleague says, in the course of dismissing this
    claim the trial judge found that the respondent had ratified these purchases
    (through its principal Dupéré).  The trial judge concluded his findings on
    the respondent’s main claim this way:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[16] … Dupéré  knew that the defendant’s purchase
    of stocks for the plaintiff’s account would include some speculative stocks
    and he was content with that as well.  The defendant kept Dupéré  aware of
    the transactions it had entered into for his account by sending him regular
    periodic statements of his account in accordance with the method he chose
    and by various telephone and personal communications with him.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[17]     Although Dupéré was content with almost
    all of the transactions entered into, he questioned the defendant about some
    from time to time and then received explanations which reassured him. There
    was nothing in those explanations which have been shown to be untrue or misleading.  Until
    late in 1997, Dupéré was a sophisticated and experience[d] businessman and
    investor and understood what was taking place with respect to the plaintiff’s
    account. Dupéré was content to receive the benefits of the defendant’s services
    despite his occasional complaints. If he was seriously displeased with the
    defendant’s performance, he could have made a formal complaint or given further
    specific instructions to the defendant with respect to how he wished the
    plaintiff’s account to be managed.  As well, he could have moved the plaintiff’s
    account elsewhere at any time but he chose to continue to maintain the plaintiff’s
    account with the defendant.  It was not until February, 1998, that he made
    any complaint in writing to the defendant.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[18]     On all of the evidence, I conclude that
    this action is based, in part, on the plaintiff’s wish, based on hindsight,
    to take advantage of the benefit of the stock purchases that appreciated
    in value and to be relieved from the losses emanating from those purchases
    that depreciated in value.  For obvious reasons, the plaintiff is not entitled
    to succeed in that endeavour.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning
    first to the short-term investments issue, I agree with my colleague that
    it was open to the trial judge to find as a fact that Mr. Dupéré gave no
    instructions to maintain these excessive amounts in the respondent’s account.  Indeed,
    the appellant does not challenge this finding.  Because this failure to follow
    its usual investment practice was without instructions, the trial judge found
    the respondent at fault as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I find, therefore, that the defendant’s default
    was likely the result of an oversight which, in the circumstances, amounted
    to negligence and a breach of the agreement which required the defendant “to
    exercise due care” as a condition of avoiding liability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    conclusion left the questions of ratification and mitigation in connection
    with the short-term investments very much alive at trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither
    the trial judge’s own reasons nor those he adopts from counsel make any express
    reference to ratification in the context of the short-term investments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge does find as a fact that Dupéré
    complained to the appellant about the excessively large sums of cash maintained
    in the respondent’s account.  The trial judge then immediately concludes
    that “Dupéré’s conduct should not excuse the defendant’s default or bar the
    plaintiff’s entitlement to relief”.  I am prepared to take it that this is
    his implicit finding about ratification.  As such, however, it presents two
    problems.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    it is purely conclusory.  It offers no analysis of why the trial judge concludes
    that the respondent did not ratify the appellant’s accumulation of excess
    short-term investments.  While there was evidence from Mr. Dupéré that he
    complained about the situation probably two or three times in 1997 and once
    in 1996, it is clear that because of the appellant’s regular reporting he
    knew about it from the time it began in March 1996.  Moreover, Mr. Dupéré’s
    evidence was that the appellant’s response to him was that it would invest
    these sums whenever a good opportunity arose. There is no evidence that Mr.
    Dupéré was dissatisfied with this response or ever gave direction to the
    appellant to invest these excess sums immediately.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge evaluates none of this evidence in the context of the ratification
    issue. One is left to ask whether he considered the evidence of the complaints
    to constitute a continuing repudiation of the appellant’s excess accumulation
    of short-term investments, despite Mr. Dupéré’s apparent acceptance of it
    and his failure to direct otherwise.  Or did he fail to consider some or
    all of this evidence?  Or did he consider it irrelevant to the issue altogether?
    His conclusory finding offers no guidance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the evidence relevant to ratification of the excess retention of short-term
    investments is very similar to the evidence relevant to the ratification
    of the purchases that were the subject of the main claim. In both cases,
    the respondent had knowledge, complained from time to time, and received
    explanations that appeared to reassure him.  The trial judge offers no explanation
    of why one should constitute ratification and the other should not.  Absent
    an irrelevant consideration, I find it hard to think of one.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    these deficiencies, I would conclude that the trial judge does not explain
    his pathway through the conflicting evidence to reach his conclusion on the
    short-term investments issue.  In other words, the reasons on the issue of
    ratification do not permit adequate appellate review.  See <i>R. v. Sheppard</i>,
    [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869; <i>Armstrong v. Centenary Health Centre</i>, [2005]
    O.J. No. 2386 (
    <st1:country-region

      <st1:place w:st="on">

    ) (Q.L.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the question of mitigation in relation to the excess short-term investments,
    the reasons are even more deficient.  In my view, there is no reference to
    mitigation at all, either explicit or implicit.  The trial judge’s view that “Dupéré’s
    conduct should not excuse the defendant’s default or bar the plaintiff’s
    entitlement to relief” cannot address this question, since the respondent
    took no steps whatever to mitigate between March 1, 1996 and December 31,
    1997 and advances none on this appeal.  Nor do I think that the trial judge’s
    calculation of damages can be said to be a reasoned disposition of the mitigation
    issue.  I am not prepared to assume that this calculation constitutes a decision
    about the need to mitigate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    judicial silence on the mitigation issue is concerning.  Assuming the respondent’s
    complaints about the excess short-term investments were enough to constitute
    continuing repudiation of the appellant’s retention of them, and that this
    negates ratification, it is hard to understand why the respondent would not
    be obliged to mitigate by directing the appellant to invest the excess rather
    than retain it.  Because of his silence, the trial judge’s reasons prevent
    any appellate understanding, let alone review, of his thinking on this issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, I disagree with my colleague that this error can be cured by deciding
    the mitigation issue for the first time in this court.  The various factors
    set out by my colleague as relevant to this issue must be applied in the
    context of seventeen days of evidence.  I do not think this court is properly
    equipped to do that effectively.  Moreover, while mitigation was argued on
    appeal it was in the context of whether the trial judge erred on the issue.  It
    was not in the context of this court deciding the issue at first instance.  Neither
    party invited us to do so.  </p>

    my view the result must be a new trial on the short-term investments issue.   While
    the errors concern the questions of ratification and mitigation, I think
    it would artificially tie the hands of the new trial judge to confine the
    new trial to these aspects of the short-term investments issue.  I would
    therefore set aside paragraph one of the judgment appealed from, and order
    a new trial on the short-term investments issue.  This remedy creates no
    prejudice to the respondent as a result of the unfortunate death of Mr. Dupéré since
    the first trial had to cope with that circumstance as well.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    entirety of the trial judge’s reasons on this issue are as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[1] … In addition, a further award is made to the
    plaintiff against the defendant, in an amount to be fixed, to compensate
    the plaintiff for its further loss as a result of the defendant’s default
    in purchasing for inclusion in the plaintiff’s investment account shares
    in Kazakhistan Minerals Corporation.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[9] … The defendant and Nicholishen deny the plaintiff’s
    allegations with one relatively minor exception. It is conceded by them,
    and supported by their expert witness, John Priestman, that shares of Kazakhistan
    Minerals Corporation which the defendant purchased for inclusion in the plaintiff’s
    account should not have been purchased.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[14] … As well, subject to the Kazakhistan exception,
    the defendant would be entitled to be relieved from any liability relating
    to the purchase or sale of any other stocks from the plaintiff’s account
    by reason of the release from liability provision contained in their agreement.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[15] … I accept his evidence that, subject to the
    Kazakhistan exception, the stocks identified by McInnes were not unsuitable
    for the plaintiff’s account and that the defendant
    “did a very good job” for the plaintiff and performed its services as it
    had promised to do.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I read the words of the trial judge, he finds the appellant liable for the
    purchase of the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Kazakhstan</st1:country-region>
    shares because of the appellant’s concession.  This would explain the absence
    of meaningful reasons on the issue, and the failure of the trial judge to
    deal at all with the appellant’s argument that in any event the respondent
    had ratified the purchase of these shares.  The finding that the appellant
    conceded liability for the purchase of these shares is not just an inappropriate
    choice of words.  It is wrong.  The appellant made no such concession.  To
    find liability on this basis is an error that in my view requires a new trial
    of the issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
    colleague reads the trial judge as accepting Mr. Priestman’s evidence that
    the purchase of the Kazakhstan shares did not comply with the model portfolio
    approach and on that basis finding the appellant liable because this purchase
    fell outside that model.  In my view this reading presents three equally
    insurmountable problems.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the finding that the purchase of the Kazakhstan shares fell outside the model
    is contradicted by the repeated findings of the trial judge (through incorporation)
    that all the purchases complained of by the respondent (including Kazakhstan)
    complied with the model.  Through incorporation, the trial judge makes the
    following clear findings:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There is no evidence that JHIC [Jones Heward],
    or any of those responsible for the management of the plaintiff’s account,
    engaged in any form of self-dealing, dishonest conduct or acted in bad faith.  To
    the contrary, the evidence establishes that the plaintiff’s account was operated,
    throughout the mandate, in accordance with the same coherent management strategy
    and investment discipline which JHIC and Nicholishen brought to bear in managing
    each one of their clients’ accounts.  In doing so, JHIC and Nicholishen invested
    the funds entrusted to them in good faith, with due care and (as is the case
    with every professional portfolio manager) in accordance with the model equity
    portfolio which had been the basis of JHIC’s track record of superior performance. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Following the opening of the account, JHIC proceeded
    to invest the plaintiff’s funds in exactly the same manner, and subject to
    exactly the same research, investment and compliance processes as it had
    and continued to apply to each and every one of its client accounts throughout
    this period.  In the result, and particularly with regard to the equity portion
    of the account, the plaintiff held the same securities, and in the same proportions,
    as every other JHIC client.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Following Dupéré’s additional investment of funds
    in early 1996, JHIC continued to invest the plaintiff’s funds according to
    the same growth-oriented investment style, and subject to the same research,
    investment and compliance processes as had been followed since the opening
    of the plaintiff’s account in early 1993.  JHIC continued to apply the same
    decision making process in the purchase and sale of securities held in its
    model portfolio with the result that the plaintiff continued to hold the
    same securities and in the same proportions as every other one of JHIC’s
    clients.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unlike
    my colleague, I cannot read these paragraphs as meaning all stocks but with
    the exception of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Kazakhstan</st1:country-region>
    .  They do not say so, unlike the earlier passages in his reasons quoted
    above, where he carefully expresses an exception for the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Kazakhstan</st1:country-region>
    shares.  I cannot see a basis for reading the exception into the trial judge’s
    findings without beginning with the assumption that the trial judge did not
    make a mistake by making incompatible findings.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, these inconsistent findings on the central fact underpinning his
    legal conclusion means that the conclusion cannot stand.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    Mr. Priestman’s evidence on the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Kazakhstan</st1:country-region>
    shares was contradicted by the evidence of the members of the appellant’s
    portfolio management team.  They testified that all of the securities that
    the respondent complained about (including
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Kazakhstan</st1:country-region>
    ) were purchased in accordance with the model portfolio. The trial judge
    recites their evidence at paragraphs sixteen, seventeen and eighteen of the
    appellant’s submissions, all of which are incorporated as part of his reasons
    for judgment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the trial judge is to be read as choosing Mr. Priestman’s evidence over that
    of the appellant’s portfolio management team, he does so entirely without
    explanation and without any obvious  reason for the choice.  Compliance (or
    not) with the model equity portfolio would not seem to require expert evidence.  Indeed
    those who developed and implemented the model might be said to be preferably
    placed to say if the model is conformed to in a particular case. The trial
    judge’s choice of Mr. Priestman’s evidence is central to his finding of liability.  Doing
    so without giving any reasons for the choice is a failure to discharge his
    obligation to give meaningful reasons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    as my colleague reads him, the trial judge finds liability on the basis of
    only one stock being purchased outside the model portfolio, out of 159 stocks
    that the appellant bought for the respondent’s account.  The trial judge
    set out the appellant’s legal obligation this way:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The defendant agreed to invest the plaintiff’s
    funds in a relatively conservative manner <u>substantially</u> in accordance
    with the parameters of its ‘model portfolio’ which it had developed for use
    by its clients and that is overwhelmingly what it did. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    obvious question is whether substantial compliance can accommodate one failure
    out of 159 purchases or whether that standard requires perfection.  In my
    view the answer is not obvious.  The trial judge’s failure to address it
    is another deficiency in his reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if the reasons on liability for the purchase of the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Kazakhstan</st1:country-region>
    shares were problem free, they are silent on the questions of ratification
    and mitigation.  These questions were as alive here as for the main claim
    of unsuitable share purchases and the claim concerning short-term investments.  The
    evidence was the same in each case: complaint followed by assurance followed
    by an apparent acceptance by the respondent and no direction to the appellant
    to do anything different.  In my view, meaningful reasons would require at
    least a limited explanation of why ratification or mitigation does not apply
    to the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Kazakhstan</st1:country-region>
    shares issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons I would conclude that a new trial is also necessary for the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Kazakhstan</st1:country-region>
    shares issue.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    because I think a new trial is necessary on both this and the short term
    investments issue, I would set aside the costs order against the appellant
    made at trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary, it is my view that the reasons for judgment are simply inadequate.  There
    are too many obscurities surrounding how the trial judge reached his conclusions
    in the face of real factual and legal issues.  As a result, the reasons do
    not permit proper appellate review.  To paraphrase <i>Sheppard</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    the appellant does not understand why he was found fully liable for the short-term
    investments and the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Kazakhstan</st1:country-region>
    shares purchase and neither do I.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would allow the appeal. </p>
