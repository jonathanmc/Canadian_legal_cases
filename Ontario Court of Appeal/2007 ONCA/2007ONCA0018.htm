style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      complainant, Mohinder Samra, testified that on July 28, 2003, he was driving
      home from his cousin’s house with his six month old baby in the back seat
      of his car.  At a red traffic light, a car stopped next to him and the
      passenger rolled down his window and accused Samra of having cut his car
      off.  Samra denied this and drove away when the light turned green.  At
      the next red light, this same individual got out of his car and approached
      Samra’s car.  He told Samra to get out of the car, which he did.  The individual
      then took Samra’s cell phone and demanded money.  Samra replied that he
      had none.  The man then punched Samra, took his keys, and drove off in
      Samra’s car with the baby still in the back seat.  Samra noted the licence
      number of the car.  The individual who took Samra’s car had come from a
      car that was registered to the Appellant’s girlfriend, Samantha Ameerally.    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>About
      a two-minute drive away, the individual abandoned the car on the side of
      a residential street.  He left the radio on, the windows down and the hazard
      lights flashing.  A passerby noticed the baby in the car and contacted
      the police.  Samra was reunited with his baby, who was unharmed, less than
      half an hour later.  </span><u></u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    main issue at trial was identity.  Although Maharaj did not match the description
    of the driver Samra gave to the police the night of the offence, Samra picked
    Maharaj out of a photo line-up the following morning.  At trial, Samra conceded
    that on the day of his arrest, Maharaj did not match the description Samra
    had given to the police.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ameerally
    was called as a Crown witness.  She testified that on the evening in question,
    Maharaj had gone out to purchase milk but returned without having bought
    any.  She also testified that Maharaj’s brother left five minutes later.  She
    denied, when asked by the Crown, that the two had left together.  After her
    examination-in-chief, the Crown successfully applied for leave to cross-examine
    her on two prior statements she had given to the police and on her prior
    testimony at the preliminary inquiry.  During the cross-examination, Ameerally
    stated that she had been telling the truth on all three occasions.  However,
    on crucial elements as to timing or Maharaj’s whereabouts on the night in
    question, Ameerally stated that she could not recall whether she had been
    truthful with the police.  She agreed that her preliminary inquiry evidence
    was “true at the time.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    cross-examination by the defence, Ameerally stated that her prior statements
    to the police were lies, and that she could not remember when Maharaj left
    her presence or when he returned.  She summarized her evidence at trial as:
    at some point Maharaj and his brother left her presence, they were gone for
    some time, that Maharaj had her car keys, and that they returned home some
    time later.  The position of the defence was that the other person in the
    car, not the appellant, had committed the alleged acts in question. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The effect of the trial judge’s
      failure to charge the jury as to the use they could make of Ameerally’s
      prior inconsistent statements</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Crown concedes that the trial judge failed to tell the jury that they could
      only use prior inconsistent statements for the truth of their contents
      if adopted by the witness.  In addition, to the extent that the witness
      did not adopt her prior statements they could only consider the statements
      in assessing the witness’s credibility. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Crown’s position is that the trial judge’s instructions to the jury were
      nevertheless adequate.  We disagree.  The trial judge’s instructions to
      the jury on how to assess credibility and his instruction that they should
      try the case only on the evidence they had heard would not have properly
      equipped the jury to deal with the prior inconsistent statements. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Crown further submits that the witness adopted the essential portions of
      her prior statements.  Whether the witness adopted her prior statements
      is for the jury to decide.  See <i>R. v. Tat and Long</i>, (1997) 117 C.C.C.
      (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at para. 21.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      defence did not object to the trial judge’s omission.  The Crown argues
      that this was a tactical decision on the part of the defence and that the
      curative proviso should be applied.  We cannot agree that, having regard
      to the position taken by counsel at trial, the omission by the defence
      to object was a tactical one.  The witness clearly and unequivocally adopted
      her prior statements to the extent it was helpful to the defence and arguably
      did not adopt other parts that would have helped the Crown.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Crown’s alternate submission for applying the proviso, that the evidence
      would have been admissible as past recollection recorded or pursuant to
      a principled exception to the hearsay rule as in <i>R. v. B.(K.G.)</i> 1992,
      79 C.C.C. (3d) 257 (S.C.C.) is problematical.  The Crown did not seek to
      have the evidence admitted on either of these bases at trial and we cannot
      say that on this record the prior statements would inevitably have been
      admissible for the truth of their contents.  Once the jury was charged,
      it was too late for the Crown to seek to introduce the evidence on a different
      basis.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
      would allow this ground of appeal and, standing alone, it necessitates
      that we order a new trial. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge told the jury
      that “in law” the offences had been made out</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before
    the defence addressed the jury, the trial judge indicated that he was thinking
    of instructing the jury that the evidence established at law that the offences
    had been made out and that the issue for the jury was who committed the offence.  The
    defence agreed that this was the appropriate instruction.  The defence’s
    position to the jury was that there was no doubt that Maharaj was present
    when the offences took place, but that the Crown had not proven beyond a
    reasonable doubt that Maharaj, and not the other person in the car, was the
    perpetrator.  After the trial judge charged the jury, the jury returned with
    a question.  It could be inferred from the jury’s question that they were
    concerned that Maharaj was not aware of the baby in the car and that he did
    not have the requisite intention to commit the offences of abduction.  However,
    the trial judge instructed them that “intention is proven,”
    thereby removing this element of the offence from their consideration.  Likewise,
    with respect to the abandonment charge, on the facts of the case the jury
    may have found that the baby’s life was not endangered as required by the
    wording of the offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although
      identity was the central issue at trial, the defence never formally admitted
      that all essential elements of the offences had been established beyond
      a reasonable doubt.  While no defence put forward was taken away from the
      jury, it is apparent from the jury’s question that they were concerned
      as to whether the Crown had proven the appellant had the necessary intention
      to commit the crimes of abduction and abandonment.  In the absence of a
      formal admission, it was for the jury to decide whether the Crown had proven
      all the elements of the offences.  See <i>R. v. Krieger </i>[2006] S.C.J.
      No. 47.  </span>While a trial judge is entitled to express his opinion
      on a question of fact, he must make it clear to the jury that this opinion
      is given as advice and not as direction. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly,
      we would allow the appeal, set aside the conviction and order a new trial.  In
      view of our disposition, we need not address the sentence appeal. </span></p>
