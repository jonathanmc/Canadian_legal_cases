line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal is a constitutional challenge to certain provisions of the <i>Safe
    Streets Act, 1999</i>, S.O. 1999, c. 8 (the “Act”) and a provision of the <i>Highway
    Traffic Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8.  The eleven appellants were convicted
    of provincial offences under the legislation and seek to have their convictions
    set aside by establishing the legislation is unconstitutional.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants Banks,
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Barrington and Collins were found engaging in what has come to be popularly
    known as
    “squeegeeing” on various roads in the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Toronto.  They approached vehicles stopped in traffic on the roadway at red
    lights, washed the windshields of the vehicles, and extended their hands,
    soliciting money from the drivers.  They were charged with soliciting business
    contrary to s. 177(2) of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants Batuszkin, Beach, Brydges, Evans, Leonard, Moran, Naugle and Stevenson
    were also found approaching motor vehicles that were stopped at red lights
    on various roadways in the City of
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto.  Some of these appellants washed the windshields of the vehicles
    and solicited money from the drivers in exchange. The others asked the drivers
    for money, by words or gestures, without offering to perform any service.  These
    appellants were charged with soliciting a person in a vehicle on a roadway
    contrary to s. 3(2)(f) of the Act. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    text of the legislative provisions pertinent to these reasons is set out
    below.  For the purposes of introduction, it is sufficient to say that the
    Act prohibits begging and panhandling in specific circumstances and, together
    with a provision of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>, entirely bans the activity
    of “squeegeeing” and the solicitation of people in vehicles on a roadway.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the appellants each admitted facts that established that they had
    contravened the Act, but challenged its constitutionality.  On August 3,
    2001, the trial judge upheld the validity of the legislation and found the
    appellants guilty. The appellants’
    appeal to the Superior Court was dismissed by the summary conviction appeal
    judge on January 14, 2005.  They appeal to this Court with leave.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants concede they violated the statutory provisions under which they
    were charged.  They submit that these provisions are constitutionally invalid
    and so they cannot be convicted.  The Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth
    and the Law has provided legal representation to some appellants and the
    Ontario Coalition Against Poverty provided legal representation to others.  It
    is not necessary to distinguish between these two organizations as their
    counsel worked together in filing a single factum and advancing one argument
    to the court.  I will refer to the Foundation and the Coalition together
    as the “Associations.”  The Canadian Civil Liberties Association (the
    “CCLA”) has intervened to argue that the relevant sections of the Act and
    the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> are unconstitutional.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit the legislation is unconstitutional because:</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber3>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    legislation is criminal law and thus beyond the legislative competence of
    the province;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber3>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    legislation infringes the right to freedom of expression guaranteed by s.
    2(b) of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber3>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    legislation infringes liberty and security of the person contrary to s. 7
    of the <i>Charter</i>; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber3>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    legislation infringes the rights to equality guaranteed by s. 15 of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would reject all of these arguments and dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    concluding that the appeal must be dismissed I take a narrower view of the
    scope of the appeal than that asserted by the Associations and the CCLA.  I
    do not agree, despite the Associations’ assertion that this proceeding was
    intended to be a comprehensive constitutional challenge to the Act, that
    this court can determine the constitutionality of provisions other than those
    under which the appellants were convicted. Nor do I agree that, as argued
    by the Associations and the CCLA, in determining these appeals the court
    can resort to an amendment made to the Act subsequent to the appellants’ convictions
    and in fact subsequent to the release of the decision of the Superior Court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    begin by setting out the relevant legislative framework.  I then explain
    why I do not adopt the broad view of the scope of the appeal put forward.  After
    that, I set out my reasons for rejecting each of the appellants’ arguments
    as to why the legislative provisions are unconstitutional.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>II.  THE LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    long title of the Act is “An Act to promote safety in Ontario by prohibiting
    aggressive solicitation, solicitation of persons in certain places and disposal
    of dangerous things in certain places, and to amend the Highway Traffic Act
    to regulate certain activities on the roadways.”  The Act received royal
    assent on December 14, 1999 and came into force on January 31, 2000.  As
    reflected in its title, the Act contains provisions that deal with solicitation
    in an aggressive manner, solicitation of captive audiences (including solicitation
    while on a roadway of a person in or on a stopped, standing or parked vehicle)
    and the disposal of dangerous things in an outdoor public place.  The Act
    also amended s. 177 of the <i>Highway Traffic Act.</i> Previously, s. 177(b)
    of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> prohibited a person, while on a roadway,
    from stopping or attempting to stop a motor vehicle for the purpose of selling
    or offering to sell any commodity or service to the driver or any other person
    in the motor vehicle.  Subsection 7(1) of the Act amended this provision
    by providing that in addition to stopping or attempting to stop a motor vehicle,
    a person also shall not “approach” a motor vehicle for the purpose of “offering,
    selling or providing” any commodity or service to the driver or any other
    person in the motor vehicle.  Please note that while the judges below referred
    to s. 7 of the Act, I refer to s. 177(2) of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>,
    as this was the section under which charges were actually laid. </p>

    appellants approached this appeal as an omnibus challenge to the Act, which
    they allege prohibits panhandling.  The prohibitions in the Act may be organised
    into three categories: the prohibition of soliciting in an aggressive manner
    in s. 2, the prohibition of soliciting a captive audience in s. 3, and the
    prohibition of soliciting a stopped car in s. 3(2)(f) and s. 177(2) of the <i>Highway
    Traffic Act</i>.  The appellants consider only s. 4 of the Act to be outside
    the scope of the appeal. Section 4 prohibits the disposal of used condoms,
    hypodermic needles and broken glass on public property.</p>

    Crown argued that the appellants could not challenge the constitutionality
    of s. 2 and oral argument was focused on this issue.  I, however, regard
    the scope of the appeal to be even narrower.  The appellants are limited
    to challenging the constitutionality of the provisions under which they were
    charged, namely s. 3(2)(f) of the Act and s. 177(2) of the <i>Highway Traffic
    Act</i>.</p>

    approaching pedestrians, asking for money and following them for a short

    the court’s jurisdiction to accord discretionary public interest standing
    had been properly invoked in this case, it could not be said that there was
    no other reasonable and effective manner in which the question could be brought
    before the court.  Sections 2 and 3(a) to (e) could be challenged by persons
    charged under them.  Presumably, there are such persons among the many who
    counsel for the Associations stated have been charged under the Act.  Such
    challenges, if and when they come before the court, will enable the court
    to decide constitutional questions on the basis of actual factual disputes,
    rather than on a hypothetical basis.  As the Supreme Court of Canada has

    of s. 2(2) was at issue in Hughes’ trial and before the summary conviction

    judge noted that <span lang=EN-US>the “captive audience” provisions of s.

    were not engaged by the facts before him.  In my view, neither the trial

line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    rejecting this argument I begin with the observation that the appellants
    cannot make their case by establishing, as they attempted to, that the enactment
    of these provisions would have been an apt exercise of the federal criminal
    law power.  This is because federal and provincial spheres of legislative
    competence are recognized to overlap.  Overlapping federal and provincial
    laws may both be constitutionally valid if enacted under an enumerated head
    in s. 91 or s. 92 of the <i>Constitution Act, 1867</i>.  The subject of the
    legislation may have one aspect that falls within federal competence and
    another aspect that falls under provincial competence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    federal criminal law power, in particular, is extremely broad.  It is commonplace
    that it overlaps with subjects within provincial competence.  For example,
    the provincial traffic offence of careless driving and the federal criminal
    law offence of dangerous driving are both constitutionally valid: <i>O’Grady
    v. Sparling</i>, [1960] S.C.R. 804; <i>R. v. Mann</i>, [1966] S.C.R. 238.  </p>

    a matter within provincial competence may also be the subject of the federal
    criminal law power, it is not enough for the appellants to show that the
    provisions they attack have a criminal law aspect.  In order to succeed,
    they must establish that the provisions do not fall within provincial competence
    or are repugnant to federal legislation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    province undoubtedly has competence to enact legislation regulating the use
    of streets, sidewalks and public spaces by the public, whether in vehicles
    or on foot, in the interest of safety, efficient circulation, and public
    enjoyment and convenience. This competence derives from its power over “property
    and civil rights in the province” under s. 92(13) and its power over matters
    of a local nature in the province under s. 92(16) of the <i>Constitution
    Act, 1867</i>.  See for example, <i>O’Grady v. Sparling, supra;
    <st1:State w:st="on">

    under s. 92(15) of the <i>Constitution Act, 1867</i> the power to enforce
    its laws by creating offences sanctioned by fine, penalty or imprisonment. </p>

    this case, s. 5 of the Act creates an offence for contravening the Act carrying
    a fine of up to $500 for a first conviction, with the potential of six months
    imprisonment for a second or subsequent conviction.  Given the province’s
    power to create offences under s. 92(15) of the <i>Constitution Act, 1867</i>,
    the existence of penal consequences has little bearing on whether provincially
    enacted provisions are criminal law. <span lang=EN-US>In considering the
    constitutionality of a provincial statute the primary question is whether

    provisions at issue in this appeal, s. 3(2)(f) of the Act and s. 177 of the <i>Highway
    Traffic Act</i>, on their face regulate the interaction of pedestrians and

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants argue, however, that even if the legislation, on its face, seems
    concerned with the regulation of traffic, it is necessary to look at both
    the legal and practical effect of the legislation to determine its pith and
    substance.  The analysis must include “‘the social or economic purposes which
    the statute was enacted to achieve’, its background and the circumstances
    surrounding its enactment and, in appropriate cases …the actual or predicted
    practical effect”
    [citations omitted.]: <i>R. v. Morgentaler</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 463 at 483.  When
    considered in this context, the appellants submit that the pith and substance
    of the legislation is not the regulation of traffic but the criminalization
    of squeegeeing.  The appellants submit that the legislation resulted from
    a “moral panic”, whereby there was an emotionally driven, exaggerated and
    disproportionate perception in the public mind of the threat posed by squeegeeing.  If
    the concern of the Act was truly traffic safety, then, the appellants submit
    any activity that might lead to interaction between pedestrians and stopped
    cars, such as political pamphleteering, would have been banned and not just
    soliciting.  </p>

    short, the appellants argue that the legislature’s concern in enacting the
    impugned provisions was to severely restrict begging in order to address
    the perceived danger of the intimidation and harassment caused by squeegeeing
    and panhandling.  The purpose of the legislation, they say, was not to make
    the roads safer.  To support the argument the appellants call upon a range
    of interpretative aids and extrinsic materials.  I will discuss these under
    the following headings: (1) The Act Read as a Whole; (2) Subsequent Legislative
    Evolution; (3) Legislative History; (4) Statements Made Outside the Legislature;
    and (5) Expert Evidence.  While I discuss these consecutively, it is their
    combined effect that has to be considered. </p>

line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I review these materials, a recurrent observation is that the appellants
    fail to appreciate the full import of the double aspect doctrine.  They underrate
    the extent of permissible overlap of federal and provincial legislative competencies
    that may result from each level of government addressing the same subject
    from a different perspective.</p>
  <h5>The Act Read as a Whole</h5>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    determining the dominant aspect of s. 3(2)(f) of the Act and s. 177(2) of
    the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>, which are at issue in this case, the statutory
    context in which they are found must be considered.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this regard, the appellants strongly rely on s. 2 of the Act, which addresses
    soliciting in an aggressive manner “that is likely to cause a reasonable
    person to be concerned for his or her safety or security.”  Specifically,
    threatening the persons solicited with physical harm, obstructing the path
    of the persons solicited, and using abusive language during the solicitation
    are prohibited.  This, the appellants say, colours the content of s. 3(2)(f)
    and s. 177(2) of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> and indicates that they too
    were intended to address the perceived danger of intimidation and harassment.  The
    appellants submit that the prohibitions of ss. 3(2)(a), (b), (c), (d), and
    (e) further support their contention that the impugned provisions were intended
    to address harassing behaviour.  Protecting members of the public from intimidation
    and harassment by others belongs to the domain of criminal law, they say.</p>

line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the words of s. 3(2)(f) of the Act and s. 177(2) of the <i>Highway Traffic
    Act</i> are clear.  They proscribe the act of soliciting a person in a stopped
    vehicle, while “on a roadway.”  No matter what one may make of the other
    provisions of the Act, intimidation and harassment are irrelevant to the
    solicitation addressed by these sections.</p>

line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    it does not assist the appellants to establish that the impugned measures
    address intimidating and harassing behaviour.  Such behaviour has a double
    aspect.  Viewed solely as the regulation of the behaviour of one member of
    society towards another, it has a criminal law aspect.  Viewed as promoting
    the safe, comfortable and enjoyable use of public thoroughfares and spaces
    it has an aspect that falls under provincial jurisdiction.</p>

    received Royal Assent on December 15, 2005.  The amendment provides that
    s. 3(2) of the Act and s. 177(2) of the <i>Highway Traffic Act </i>do not
    apply to fund-raising activities of charitable organizations that are permitted
    by municipal by-law.  The appellants sought to rely on the amendment, arguing
    that it confirms their position that the Act was enacted, not out of concern
    about traffic safety, but to specifically target the type of solicitation
    engaged in by those who squeegee car windows.</p>

    of the subsequent amendment in the interpretation of the original Act is
    foreclosed by s. 17 of the <i>Interpretation Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.11.  It
    provides:</p>

    subsequent evolution of a statute cannot be put to the use the appellants
    advocate:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>What legal commentators
    call “subsequent legislative history” can cast no light on the intention

    of the courts and not the lawmakers that matters.  It is for judges to determine
    what the intention of the enacting Parliament was.</p>

    would be inclined to the view that the amendment suggests the Act in its
    original form applied to solicitation by charities and the amendment was
    necessary to effect a change. </p>

    page 484, that Hansard evidence is admissible as relevant to both the background
    and the purpose of legislation provided that the court remains mindful of
    its limited reliability and weight.  The best indication of the legislature’s
    intent is the text of the statute it has enacted and the intent and meaning
    of remarks made in the House are often disputed.  Certainly, that is so in

    the effect of the Act on legitimate charities by saying:
    “What I read into that question is a disgraceful lack of confidence in the
    police to use common sense in understanding the difference between aggressive
    panhandling, that which is interfering and causing safety concerns, and the
    case you raised” (<i>ibid</i>. at 431).  The Attorney General said that it
    was a “misrepresentation of the intent” of the Act to think that “traditional
    fundraisers for charities … can no longer be held because these actions would
    be subject to prosecution” (<i>ibid</i>. at 439).</p>

    Crown also cites the debates to submit that the original Act was not intended
    to be selectively enforced against panhandlers only.  It observes that the
    examples to which the Premier was responding in the passage quoted above
    were students holding up signs along roadways to invite motorists into charity
    car washes and a charity selling newspapers at traffic signals (see <i>ibid.</i> at
    430).  The Crown submits that it is far from clear that these activities
    would violate the Act at all, and therefore the Premier’s response does not
    indicate that he contemplated selective enforcement.  Similarly, the Crown
    points to the fact that after making the comments cited above, the Attorney
    General went on to say, “If this law passes, a Boy Scout or any other volunteer
    for a charitable organization may continue to solicit in a non-aggressive
    manner at locations where members of the public are not a captive audience” (<i>ibid.</i> at
    439).  The Crown concludes that there is nothing in the debates to show that
    the legislature’s intention was to enforce the Act exclusively against panhandlers.</p>

    this Hansard evidence in support of its submission that the Act is properly
    characterized as valid provincial legislation relating to traffic safety.  The
    Crown cites the following passage:</p>
  <p class=MsoBlockText>It is time for government to exercise its responsibility

    when people enter the road to offer unwanted services, resulting in a significant
    safety hazard. I personally have met with business people who say that their
    employees and customers routinely have difficulty entering stores and offices

line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    it is not clear whether the Hansard comments relied upon by the appellants,
    no matter what one makes of them, were made in relation to the impugned provisions.  Certainly,
    some of the comments seem to address the aggressive panhandling provisions
    of s. 2. While s. 2 provides valuable context, the impugned provisions themselves
    are clear.  They address the activities of pedestrians on roadways interacting
    with stopped vehicles. </p>

    accepting that Hansard supports the appellants’
    position that an important aspect of the statute was to address intimidating
    or harassing behaviour and that the primary concern of the legislature in
    enacting s. 3(2)(f) of the Act and s. 177(2) of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> was
    the activity of squeegeeing, it does not follow that the legislation is criminal
    law. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants’ argument that legislative measures to control intimidating or
    harassing behaviour is necessarily criminal law is simply incorrect.  As
    mentioned above, while measures to address intimidating behaviour could aptly
    be addressed under the federal criminal law power, addressing such behaviour
    is not beyond the power of a province acting under a constitutional head
    of competence.  For example, the same behaviour is capable of being a criminal
    assault under federal criminal law and sexual harassment under provincial
    human rights legislation.  The issue is not whether the province has enacted
    measures to control intimidating or harassing behaviour, but whether the
    province has enacted them under a constitutional head of competence in doing
    so.</p>

      v. The Queen, </i>[1983] 1 S.C.R. 43, upon which the appellants rely, is
      distinguishable because the bylaw in that case prohibited communication
      for the purposes of prostitution without any concern about the control
      and enjoyment of property.  The Supreme Court of Canada said at 52: “There
      is no property question here, no question even of interference with the
      enjoyment of public property let alone private property.”</p>

line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    province has the competence to prohibit intimidating and harassing behaviour
    to the extent necessary to ensure the safe and enjoyable use of public thoroughfares
    and spaces.  The ample and pointed references of the Premier and Attorney
    General to intimidating and harassing behaviour were made in the context
    of ensuring the public’s right to “drive on the roads, walk down the street
    or go to public places without being or feeling intimidated.”</p>

    vehicles by pedestrians “on the roadway” as it has done in s. 3(2)(f) of
    the Act and in s. 177(2) of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>.  The legislative
    record indicates that the perceived problem that prompted the legislature
    to take action may have been the activity of squeegeeing.  However, the legislative
    record also indicates that the legislature’s concern with squeegeeing was
    its perceived negative effect on the safe, efficient and enjoyable use of

      as a matter of weight to be determined at the end of the case.  In the
      end, he made little mention of the material and in fact treated it somewhat
      dismissively.  In the context of discussing the appellants’
    s. 15 argument he said:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Much of the

      of little or no weight.  For the most part, they were tendered for purposes
      relevant to the appellants’ <i>Charter</i> arguments.  I will have more
      to say about them when discussing those issues. Insofar as they were tendered
      to establish that the dominant aspect of the Act was the criminalization
      of squeegeeing, rather than the regulation of the streets, they are not
      useful to the analysis.</span><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    example, <span lang=EN-GB>Professor Ezra Hauer,</span> an engineer experienced
    in road safety research and consulting, expressed the opinion that “the thrust
    of the Act has no direct bearing on road safety.”  This affidavit is not
    helpful because whether, and to what extent, the Act actually improves traffic
    safety is not a question for the court.  The wisdom and efficacy of the statute
    is the concern of the legislature: <i>Reference Re: Anti-Inflation Act (
    <st1:country-region

      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>

    legislature could enact the legislation to regulate the use of streets and
    sidewalks. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, Professor Hauer’s affidavit did not go as far as the appellants
    would have it. Professor Hauer, as I read his affidavit, did recognize that
    a person stepping onto the roadway to interact with stopped vehicles presented
    a danger.  He made two points: (1) approaching stopped vehicles has not been
    cited as a factor in the occurrence of motor vehicle accidents; and (2) the
    risk of harm to persons soliciting such stopped vehicles would be about the
    same as that presented by other activities, such as handing out political
    pamphlets.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fact that approaching a vehicle that is already stopped has not been reported
    to be a factor in the occurrence of motor vehicle accidents is irrelevant.
    The legislature has the competence to address the danger presented by a pedestrian
    stepping onto the roadway to approach a stopped vehicle. Documented reports
    of such activity causing traffic accidents are not a necessary prerequisite
    for the province’s competence. Nevertheless, there is evidence in the record
    from the head of Traffic Safety Programs for the Toronto Police Service that “the
    safety of both motorists and pedestrians will be enhanced where pedestrians
    are restricted as much as possible from entering on the roadway at places
    other than cross walks and traffic lights, and where their interaction with
    the vehicles and motorists on the roadway is minimized.” Moreover, the legislature’s
    competence to address the activity is not undermined by the fact that another
    activity, stopping a moving vehicle, may be more dangerous.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second point made by Professor Hauer that the Act does not prohibit activities
    such as political pamphleteering that may be as dangerous as soliciting stopped
    vehicles is of no assistance to the appellants’
    criminal law argument.  The legislature has the constitutional competence
    to prohibit the activity of approaching cars stopped on roadways for the
    purposes of soliciting.  In responding to an actual concern, the legislature
    did not have to address every activity that might conceivably interfere with
    the safe and enjoyable use of the streets.  There is no evidence that political
    pamphleteers were interfering with traffic by stepping onto roadways to distribute
    pamphlets to drivers at red lights or waiting in traffic thus raising a concern
    that the legislature did not address.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellants’ focus on traffic safety ignores the breadth of the province’s
    jurisdiction to regulate the use of streets.  The fact that approaching stopped
    cars for the purpose of soliciting interferes with the efficient flow of
    traffic is enough to give the legislature competence to prohibit the activity.  It
    is worth noting that according to the agreed statements of fact filed before
    the trial judge, some of the appellants did not leave the intersections where
    they solicited drivers until after the traffic lights had changed.  The presence
    of pedestrians in traffic lanes is an obvious interference with traffic circulation.
    While hardly necessary, there is evidence to this effect in the record.</p>

    who often experience health and security issues that prevent them from maintaining
    employment.  The affidavit of Professor O’Grady suggested that squeegeeing
    supports the psychological well-being of street youth.  He deposed that prohibiting
    squeegeeing would encourage some homeless youth to engage in other unlawful
    activity, such as theft or dealing in drugs.  Kolin Davidson, a former street

    of self-preservation.  He said that some persons living on the street have
    no other option and turn to panhandling and squeegeeing to survive. While

    a bawdy-house and communication in a public place for the purpose of engaging
    in prostitution. These were said to infringe the appellants’ s. 7 rights
    to liberty and security. Specifically, it was argued that the sections violated
    the right to security of the person by preventing a prostitute from obtaining
    the basic necessities of life such as food, shelter and clothing. The majority

    In my view, the jurisprudence that has developed under the Charter has made
    it clear that economic rights as generally encompassed by the term

    The trial judge concluded that the affidavit evidence filed by the appellants “does
    not establish that the legislation affects their economic right to survival

    second prong is that the substantive effect of the enforcement of the provisions
    is different for the appellants than for others.  The ban on soliciting while
    on a roadway may inconvenience others, but it prevents the appellants from
    pursuing their means of subsistence.  The appellants submit that the provisions
    are akin to a prohibition on sleeping under bridges that affects the homeless,
    but not the rich. </p>

    They are all homeless or without a fixed address, they are extremely poor,
    and they are beggars. As a group, beggars have been historically disadvantaged,
    and economically and politically marginalized.  The provisions stereotype
    them and deepen their disadvantageous position in society.</p>

    is implicit from the appellants’ submissions that the comparator group in
    the first prong is composed of those to whom the legislation applies, but
    against whom the appellants allege it is not enforced.  In the second prong,
    the comparator group is comprised of those who are prohibited from soliciting
    on a roadway, but whose subsistence is not affected by the enforcement of
    the legislation.</p>

    reject the first prong of the appellants’ argument for two reasons.  First,
    selective enforcement against those who beg or squeegee was not established
    as a matter of fact.  The summary conviction appeal judge described the appellants’ evidence
    of selective enforcement as “frail.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    there is a distinction between the discriminatory effects of legislation
    and discrimination in the administration of legislation. An example of the
    former would be a law that required all persons to wear safety helmets. When
    enforced evenly against all persons, such a facially neutral law would have
    the effect of discriminating against Sikh men who must wear turbans. This
    is different from the selective enforcement of a neutral safety helmet requirement
    unevenly against only one group. In the first prong of their argument, the
    appellants allege discrimination in the enforcement of legislation that applies
    to all who solicit on roadways. Any discrimination in enforcement, if such
    exists, is not an incident of the legislation, but of its administration.  The
    remedy would lie against those administering the legislation in a discriminatory
    fashion and not in a finding that the legislation itself is unconstitutional.</p>

    second prong of the appellants’ argument also fails on the facts.  The trial
    judge found that the Act, considered as a whole, did not affect the appellants’ economic
    right to survival in any fundamental sense.  Given this factual finding,
    it has not been established that enforcement of the prohibition against soliciting
    while on a roadway has a more onerous substantive effect on the appellants
    than it does on others.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    even if the appellants had established that there is differential treatment
    under the impugned provisions, they have not demonstrated that this is based
    on an enumerated or analogous ground.  The appellants, in their factum, variously
    describe the proposed ground as “beggars”, “extreme poverty”, “poverty that
    is so severe that people are forced to solicit alms in public” and “those
    poor enough to need to beg.”  In their oral submissions, the appellants spoke
    of “beggars” for the most part.  They say the extreme poverty suffered by
    the poor who beg is a characteristic that is not within their control or
    that could only be changed at a great personal cost.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    seems to me that the appellants identify the proposed group not by a personal
    characteristic, but by an activity.  The act of begging is essential to the
    identification of an individual as a member of the proposed group.  The proposed
    group is, in essence, “the poor who beg.”  Professor Hogg suggests that a
    common element of the enumerated grounds is that “[t]hey describe what a
    person is, rather than what a person does”: Peter W. Hogg, <i>Constitutional
    Law in Canada</i>, looseleaf (Scarborough: Thomson Carswell, 1997) vol. 2
    at 52-31. I would not find that an activity could never be used to identify
    a prohibited ground of discrimination.  However, in this case I do not regard
    the activity of begging to be an immutable or constructively immutable personal
    quality that can only be changed at a “great personal cost.”  </p>

    my view, the &quot;great personal cost&quot;
    contemplated by the cases refers to a cost to the individual's dignity, as
    the protection of dignity is, after all, the essence of s. 15’s purpose.  I
    believe this is evident from <i>Corbière v.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">

    para. 13 that a criterion for recognizing a ground as analogous is that it
    is “a personal characteristic that is immutable or changeable <u>only at
    unacceptable cost to personal identity</u>.” [Emphasis added.]  Therefore,
    in determining whether a personal characteristic qualifies as an analogous
    ground under s. 15, one must consider whether it cannot be changed without
    unacceptable cost to one’s identity and dignity.  </p>

    that they beg as components of a culture that is important to their identity.  Rather
    they have put these matters forward as indicators of their economic status
    with which they have to cope.  I note that in advancing their s. 7 argument,
    the appellants describe begging as a <span lang=EN-GB>private choice of a

    is worth noting that the appellants took care not to argue that “poverty” in
    and of itself is a ground of discrimination. While the
    “poor” undoubtedly suffer from disadvantage, without further categorization,
    the term signifies an amorphous group, which is not analogous to the grounds
    enumerated in s. 15.  The “poor” are not a discrete and insular group defined
    by a common personal characteristic.  While it is common to speak of the “poor”
    collectively, the group is, in actuality, the statistical aggregation of
    all individuals who are economically disadvantaged at the time for any reason.  Within
    this unstructured collection, there may well be groups of persons defined
    by a shared personal characteristic that constitute an analogous ground
    of discrimination under s. 15.  </p>

    was not restricted to traffic lanes used by vehicles and the form of expression,
    amplified music from inside a club, did not impede the function of a city

    this test, the ultimate question is whether free expression in the public
    place at issue would undermine the values s. 2(b) is designed to promote: <i>Montréal
    (City)</i> at para. 77. The historical and actual function of the place,
    and whether other aspects of the place suggest that expression in the place
    would undermine the values underlying free expression, are factors to consider
    in answering that ultimate question.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the historical use of the portion of a roadway ordinarily used
    for vehicular traffic was neither the subject of evidence nor argument. I
    take judicial notice that this portion of roadways has historically been
    used, and continues to be used, from time to time for expressive activities
    such as demonstrations and parades. However, in the absence of the parties
    having had the opportunity to address this issue I am reluctant to use it
    in the analysis. I proceed to consider the next factor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court in <i>Montréal (City)</i> indicated that the actual function
    of the space should be considered. It must be determined whether the activity
    for which the space is used is compatible with open public expression, or
    if the activity is one that requires privacy and limited access. The court
    posed the following questions at para. 76: &quot;Would an open right to intrude
    and present one's message by word or action be consistent with what is done
    in the space? Or would it hamper the activity?&quot;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

lang=EN-US>Clearly, the open right to engage in expression on the traveled portion
      of a roadway would hamper the intended function of the space. Such expression
      conflicts with the purpose of a traffic lane. However, the question is
      not free of doubt as the Supreme Court of Canada stated clearly at para.
      77 of <i>Montréal (City)</i> that “the ultimate question, however, will
      always be whether free expression in the place at issue would undermine
      the values the guarantee is designed to promote.” It is not clear to me
      that the appellants’ expression, although incompatible with the function
      of a traffic lane, undermines the values s. 2(b) is designed to promote.  Further
      cases will provide needed guidance on how and in what circumstances the
      incompatibility of expression with the actual function of a place operates
      to undermine the values of s. 2(b).  In this case, the appellants’ expression
      promoted their participation in the community, their pursuit of individual
      self-fulfillment and human flourishing even though it interfered with the
      intended activity of the place where they expressed themselves. Their expression
      may have endangered traffic safety and impeded efficient circulation, but
      I cannot say it undermined the purposes s. 2(b) is intended to serve: democratic
      discourse, truth finding and self-fulfillment.  </span></p>

line-height:normal'>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    are concerned here with more than the appellants’ physical presence on a
    roadway. Section 3(2)(f) prohibits the act of soliciting while physically
    present on a roadway. No matter what the object of the solicitation may be,
    it is an expressive act. The appellants Batuszkin, Beach, Brydges, Evans,
    Leonard, Moran, Naugle and Stevenson were convicted of soliciting while on
    a roadway. The appellants Banks,
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Barrington and Collins were convicted not for the physical act of approaching
    vehicles on a roadway, but of approaching them to offer, sell or provide
    a service.</p>

line-height:normal'>[126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    larger statutory context of the impugned provisions, which addresses soliciting
    more directly, leads me to the conclusion that s. 3 (2)(f) of the Act and
    s. 177(2) of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> were intended to control the
    expressive activity of soliciting while on a roadway. This conclusion does
    not detract from my earlier finding that their dominant aspect is the regulation
    of the interaction of pedestrians and vehicles on the roadways in the interests
    of public safety, efficient circulation, and public enjoyment of public thoroughfares.
    It is simply that in achieving that overall objective the legislation has
    the incidental purpose of restricting soliciting which is an expressive activity.<span style='font-size:

      the objective of regulating </span>the interaction of pedestrians and vehicles
      on roadways <span lang=EN-US>is important enough to warrant overriding
      the right guaranteed by</span><span lang=EN-US> s. 2(b).  In a free and

      prohibiting persons from soliciting or approaching a vehicle while “on

      the presence of pedestrians in traffic lanes may rationally be expected
      to lessen traffic dangers and increase the efficiency of vehicular circulation.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>Third, </span><span
lang=EN-US>the provisions impair the appellants’ right of expression as little
      as possible. </span>While the legislation does effectively ban squeegeeing
      on roadways, it does not<span
lang=EN-US> prohibit the appellants from expressing their message that they are
      in need of help. I appreciate that the provisions of the Act not in issue
      in this appeal place other restrictions on where and how the appellants
      may solicit. Still, they are left </span>with many alternatives. They can
      convey their message on the sidewalk. They cannot squeegee car windows,
      but to the extent that they may wish to provide a service in exchange for
      donations, there are other alternatives available. </p>

    the deleterious effects do not outweigh the benefits of the limits of the
    legislation. The limits achieve the objective of promoting public safety,
    efficient circulation, and public enjoyment of public thoroughfares.<span lang=EN-US> The
    impairment of the appellants’ rights is minimal. They cannot proceed onto
    the traffic lanes of roadways. A possible criticism of the legislation is
    not that it is too broad, but that it is too narrow. The appellants submit
    that it does not prohibit political pamphleteering. Assuming such an activity
    would not be “soliciting” under the Act, the fact that the legislation is
    under-inclusive is not a basis for finding that it is unconstitutional. A
    prohibition of any and all physical presence of a pedestrian on a roadway
    would have been too broad. Many persons are required by their work duties
    to be on foot in traffic lanes. It is understandable and constitutionally
    permissible for the legislature to attempt to tailor restrictions to the
    actual problem that it has identified and has sought to remedy. In this case,
    there is no evidence of political pamphleteering in traffic lanes being a
    problem warranting legislative action or even that it occurs. </span></p>
