      and funding, he stated that openness and transparency were guiding principles
      of the inquiry.  In an earlier ruling dealing with a request for a publication
      ban (“Directions on Process – Requests for Confidentiality of Victims’ or
      Alleged Victims’ Identities”, October 31, 2006) the Commissioner stated,

    of inquiry with the ability to achieve their goals.”  I also consider the
    role of the Commissioner, his familiarity with the mandate and operation

      the review of an order made under a different test.  <i>Dagenais</i> established

        The issue, therefore, is whether the Commissioner’s ruling refusing the

      the appellant argues that a ban on publication of the name or identifying

      the first point, the Commissioner expressly adverted to the need to consider
      the protection of the employee’s reputation as an innocent person.  He
      stated that “the presumption of innocence and the protection of the innocent
      are important interests that should be taken into consideration in the
      first branch of the <i>Dagenais/Mentuck</i> test.”  The Commissioner added,
      however, that the presumption of innocence and the protection of the innocent
      do not
    “supersede the principle of an open hearing in all cases.”  That determination “will
    depend on the circumstances and each case should be assessed on a case-by-case
    basis.” </span></p>

      see no error in the Commissioner’s statement of the applicable legal principles.
      The appellant relies on the majority judgment of Dickson J. in <i>Nova
      Scotia (Attorney General) v. MacIntyre</i>, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 175, a case
      dealing with the public’s right to inspect a search warrant and the information
      upon which it was obtained. Dickson J. held, at 186-87, that
    “curtailment of public accessibility can only be justified where there is
    present the need to protect social values of superordinate importance.  One
    of these is the protection of the innocent.” Where a search warrant was issued
    but nothing was found, Dickson J. concluded that protection of the innocent
    is an overriding social value and is sufficiently important to justify curtailment
    of public accessibility. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      my view, <i>MacIntyre</i>, <i>supra</i>, dealt with the specific situation
      of search warrants and does not stand for the proposition that protection
      of the innocent <i>always</i> prevails over the public’s right to know,
      particularly when read in the light of the post-<i>Charter</i> cases: see <i>Dagenais</i>, <i>supra</i>, <i>Mentuck</i>, <i>supra</i>, and <i>Toronto
      Star</i>, <i>supra</i>.  These cases reinforce the presumption of openness
      upon which <i>MacIntyre</i> rests and posit a flexible and contextual balancing
      test that is to be applied in a non-mechanistic fashion with reference
      to the particular interests at stake.  While protection of the reputation
      of innocent persons is a highly significant factor to be weighed in that
      balance, it does not automatically trump the public interest in an open
      hearing and the right to freedom expression, just as the public interest
      in an open hearing and the right to freedom of expression do not automatically
      trump the protection of innocence. As the Commissioner properly found,
      all the pertinent rights and interests must be weighed on the balance. </span></p>

      appellant also relies upon <i>Vickery v. Nova Scotia Supreme Court (Prothonotary)</i>,
      [1991] 1 S.C.R. 671, where immediately after a conviction was overturned
      on appeal a journalist sought access to an illegally obtained confession
      that had been excluded by the appeal court.  Another case in the same line
      is <i>Re Canadian Broadcasting Corporation </i>(2005), 205 C.C.C. (3d)
      435 (Nfld. Sup.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ct.) where, after two charges were stayed and the other withdrawn, the media
    moved unsuccessfully to set aside a ban on the publication of the name of
    the accused.  In both cases, the ban was justified as being necessary to
    protect an innocent person.  Again, I do not read these cases as standing
    for the proposition that the protection of the innocent must inevitably prevail
    over openness and freedom of expression.  One must always have regard to
    the particular context in which the request for a publication ban arises.  In <i>Vickery</i> and <i>Re
    Canadian Broadcasting Corporation</i>, all proceedings had come to an end
    and the publication bans had no impact upon the openness or successful operation
    of an ongoing proceeding.  In the present case we are dealing with a public
    inquiry called to clear the air of allegations of conspiracy and cover-up
    and to “encourage community healing and reconciliation”. Openness is a factor
    relevant to the Commission’s success in accomplishing that mandate, a factor
    not present in the cases upon which the appellant relies. </span></p>

      appellant also relies on <i>Gagnon v. Southam</i>, [1989] R.J.Q. 1145,
      where the Quebec Court of Appeal upheld a publication ban imposed by a
      commission of inquiry. That case may be readily distinguished on the ground
      that the court was upholding the discretion of the commissioner to grant
      a publication ban in relation to very different terms of reference. In
      any event, the decision pre-dates the establishment of the <i>Dagenais/Mentuck</i> test
      and therefore did not turn on the law that now applies to this issue. </span></p>

      Commissioner considered several factors that mitigated the risk to the
      employee’s reputation.  He pointed out that the Commission would not and
      could not try or re-try the allegations of sexual abuse. He observed that
      the employee’s counsel “will most certainly ensure that the evidence of
      the Moving Party’s acquittal comes out” and, as I have mentioned, he took
      steps to correct the witness who testified that the employee had been acquitted
      because of a reasonable doubt on the evidence.  The Commissioner found
      that in view of the acquittal establishing the employee’s innocence, “one
      cannot presume that the public, equipped with the reminders of the Moving
      Party’s acquittal, will jump to any unfair or unfounded allegations about
      the Moving Party.”  The Commissioner also indicated that the employee could
      object to evidence of the specifics of the allegations and indeed later
      made rulings and redacted certain documents to that end.  The Commissioner
      also noted that the employee had been subjected to a considerable amount
      of publicity at the time of his trial and acquittal so that he was not
      being exposed for the first time as a result of the Commission.  These
      findings are essentially factual in nature and unassailable before the
      application judge and before this court.  They demonstrate that the Commissioner
      gave serious consideration to the protection of the employee’s innocence.
      I cannot say that his consideration of these factors was unreasonable.</span></p>

      turn to the appellant’s second contention, namely, that the Commission
      could accomplish its task even if the requested publication ban were granted.  To
      consider this argument, one must have close regard to the nature of the
      Commissioner’s mandate.  The Commission was appointed to respond to allegations
      of a pedophile ring and of conspiracy, collusion, and cover-up by various
      institutions and individuals.  The central question for the Commissioner
      is whether the justice system and other public institutions responded adequately
      to allegations of historical sexual abuse against young people.  The Commission
      is specifically directed to encourage community healing and reconciliation.  The
      Commissioner is required to consider whether the allegations made by Marleau
      against Lapierre and the employee were properly investigated and whether
      the appellant responded appropriately to those allegations.  It was in
      this context that the Commissioner found that the employee’s “name is relevant
      when considering the interconnectedness of persons, particularly given
      the allegations of conspiracy that surround the facts giving rise to this
      Inquiry.”
    I am not persuaded that this finding was unreasonable. </span></p>

      if it were possible for the Commission to conduct certain fact-finding
      investigations by using a moniker to identify the employee, one must have
      regard to the fact that this is a public inquiry called to clear the air
      in a community long troubled by rumours, innuendoes, and allegations of
      secrecy and cover-up.  The employee’s prosecution and acquittal were widely
      reported in the local media and he is well-known in the community.  His
      identity cannot be viewed as a mere detail that is not germane to the inquiry.  A
      central purpose of this Commission is to facilitate the public’s understanding
      of the institutional response to the allegations made against well-known
      individuals, including the employee, prominent in the community and whose
      names have already been in the public eye in relation to this very controversy.  </span></p>

    they provide the means for Canadians to be apprised of the conditions pertaining
    to a worrisome community problem and to be a part of the recommendations
    that are aimed at resolving the problem.  Both the status and high public
    respect for the commissioner and the open and public nature of the hearing
    help to restore public confidence not only in the institution or situation
    investigated but also in the process of government as a whole.  </p>

      public’s special interest and right to know take on added significance
      as the Commission’s mandate is not restricted to fact-finding but also
      includes community healing.  As Cory J. stated in <i>Phillips</i>, <i>supra</i>,
      at para. 117, open hearings “function as a means of restoring the public
      confidence” and act as a “type of healing therapy for a community shocked
      and angered by a tragedy.”  In my view, these observations are apposite
      to this case.</span></p>

      Commissioner applied the appropriate legal test in assessing the request
      for a publication ban.  He gave careful consideration to the protection
      of innocence and to the employee’s particular situation. He found that
      the employee’s name was relevant to his mandate given the interconnectedness
      of those caught up in the controversy.  As the allegations against the
      employee had already been publicized in the community, the Commissioner
      concluded that with appropriate emphasis upon the acquittal and by expunging
      reference to the details of the allegations, the impact of disclosure of
      the employee’s name could be minimized.  He concluded that the appellant
      had not satisfied the burden of demonstrating that there was a serious
      risk to the administration of justice or that the salutary effects of a
      publication ban outweighed the deleterious effects on the public interest
      in openness.  </span></p>

      recognize that the employee’s innocence has been judicially determined
      and that there may be an element of unfairness in permitting publication
      of his identity as Marleau’s evidence regrettably does pose a risk that
      the employee’s reputation may be damaged. I am not persuaded, however,
      that the Commissioner’s conclusion in favour of openness was unreasonable
      on the particular facts before him, particularly in view of his core mandate
      to help heal a community long-troubled by allegations of conspiracy, secrecy,
