      entered on December 13, 2004 by Justice John F. Hamilton of the Superior
      Court of Justice, sitting without a jury</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>.</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant appeals his conviction on one count of possession of a firearm
    while prohibited and one count of breach of probation with respect to the
    firearm.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was stopped by the police, searched and found to be in possession
    of an unloaded sawed-off rifle.&nbsp; He submits that he was unlawfully detained
    and searched and that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10(b) of the <i>Charter
    of Rights and Freedoms</i> were infringed.&nbsp; He submits further that
    the evidence gathered from the unlawful search should have been excluded
    under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    incident occurred in a high crime neighbourhood where the police had been
    requested to attend by the community.&nbsp; The police officer knew the appellant
    and knew that he did not reside in the area. He also knew the appellant’s
    prior criminal activity and initially observed the appellant with a woman
    who was known to the officer to be a prostitute and a crack user. &nbsp;The
    police officer observed suspicious behaviour (“blading”, a police term for
    an attempt to conceal a weapon) on the part of the appellant.&nbsp; The Crown
    accepts that the appellant was detained from the moment the officer asked
    him to walk to the scout car for a C.P.I.C. check, at which point the officer
    noticed a bulge in the left side of the appellant’s pants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Assuming,
    that the appellant was arbitrarily detained, as the appellant argues, the
    evidence nonetheless should not be excluded.&nbsp; In our view, this case
    cannot be distinguished from the recent decision of this court in <i>R. v.
    Grant</i> (2006), 209 C.C.C. (3d) 250. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;</span>As
    stated in <i>Grant</i>, the reliability of the evidence and the nature of
    the police’s conduct that led to their obtaining the evidence, suggest that
    though the admission of this evidence would have had some impact on trial
    fairness, that impact would not have been so great as to preclude consideration
    of the other two <i>Collins</i> factors. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;</span>With
    respect to the seriousness of the violation, the detention was quite brief,
    the appellant had a lesser expectation of privacy in a public area than he
    would have in his home and the questioning was minimally intrusive. The trial
    judge did not make a finding of bad faith and the record does not support
    a finding that the police acted in bad faith even though the officer had
    some prior knowledge and dealings with the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    note that the Crown’s case depended entirely on the gun.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;</span>Finally,
    as stated by this court in <i>Grant</i>, “In this case, where the police
    did not grossly overstep the bounds of legitimate questioning, acted in good
    faith, used no force, and were patrolling one of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto’s high-crime areas, … the repute of the justice system would suffer
    if the evidence were excluded.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is dismissed.</p>
