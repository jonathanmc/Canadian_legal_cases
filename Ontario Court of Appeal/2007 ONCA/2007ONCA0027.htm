  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment of Justice </span><span lang=EN-US>Randall S. Echlin of
    the Superior Court of Justice dated December 30, 2004.</span></h4>
  <h2>APPEAL&nbsp;BOOK ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants appeal the judgment of Echlin&nbsp;J. dated 30
    December 2004 whereby he held that the appellants made fraudulent
    misrepresentations that induced the respondents to purchase a restaurant
    business for $235,000.  The trial judge
    ordered rescission of the contract and awarded the respondents general damages
    of $335,000, punitive damages of $30,000 and costs of $85,000 on a substantial
    indemnity basis.  The appellants appeal
    all aspects of this judgment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, there is no basis on which to attack the trial
    judge's central finding that the appellants’ conduct amounted to fraudulent misrepresentation
    that induced the respondents to enter into the contract to purchase the
    restaurant business.  He carefully
    reviewed the testimony of the crucial witnesses.  He rejected the testimony of the appellant Mahnaz Golchin and the
    appellants’ accountant, Edward Avanessy, concerning the false financial
    statements for the years 1998 and 1999.  There is nothing in the trial judge’s reasons which comes close to being
    a palpable and overriding error which, the appellants concede, is the standard
    of review on this issue.  It follows
    that the trial judge’s rescission of the contract and return, by way of
    damages, of the purchase price of $235,000 are entirely appropriate remedies.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The additional $100,000 in damages is much more problematic,
    as the trial judge recognized: “While the evidence was imprecise”.  In our view, there was no evidence to
    support the $70,000 management fee component of the claimed additional
    expenditures.  Indeed, with respect to
    this amount, the respondent Nasir Nasri testified that “we put money from this
    pocket and put it in another pocket.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no basis for interfering with the trial judge’s award
    of punitive damages of $30,000.  His
    description of the appellants’ conduct concerning the transaction with the
    respondents as “high&#8209;handed, callous and outrageous” is amply supported
    by the record and his legal analysis is consistent with the framework set out
    in <i>Whiten v. Pilot Insurance Co.</i> (2002), 209 D.L.R. (4th) 257 (S.C.C.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge awarded costs of $85,000 on a substantial
    indemnity basis “having regard to the deceptive conduct of the defendants in
    attempting to commit a fraud upon the plaintiffs.”  With respect, this is not a proper basis for awarding costs on a
    substantial indemnity scale.  As stated
    by Weiler&nbsp;J.A. in <i>Gerula v. Flores</i> (1995), 83 O.A.C. 128 at para.&nbsp;74: “[S]olicitor and client costs should
    relate to the conduct of the action and not to the conduct which might have
    been the subject of punitive damages”.  Since the trial judge took account of the appellants’ conduct <i>vis&#8209;à&#8209;vis</i> the respondents in
    relation to the transaction in his award of punitive damages, to do so,
    explicitly, as the sole basis for awarding substantial indemnity costs amounts
    to double compensation and is an error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal is allowed to this extent: general
    damages are reduced to $265,000 and costs are reduced from $85,000 to $55,000
    (the costs component of $23,046 is maintained).  In all other respects, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Success on the appeal is divided.  Accordingly, there will be no order for costs of the appeal.  The appellants are entitled to costs of
    $2400 for the appeal hearing which failed to proceed in October&nbsp;2006.  The appellants sought the suspension of post&#8209;judgment
    interest from October&nbsp;3,&nbsp;2006 to January&nbsp;17,&nbsp;2007.  We do not accept this submission:  the appellants have had the use of the money
    in this period.</p>
