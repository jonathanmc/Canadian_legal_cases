  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the convictions
      entered on January 28, 2005, and the sentences imposed on June 15, 2005,
      by Justice Thomas N. Dunn of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with
      a jury.</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BY THE COURT:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was convicted of sexual assault (x2), assault (x4), sexual touching
    and indecent assault against members of his extended family.&nbsp; One of
    the sexual assault convictions was stayed pursuant to <i>R. v. Kienapple</i>.  The
    offences are historical in nature and were alleged to have occurred over
    a thirty-year span.&nbsp; He was sentenced to a global sentence of twelve
    months incarceration plus probation for two years and a D.N.A. order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant denied all of the allegations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;</span>The
    appellant appeals the convictions on the basis of the dismissal of his application
    under s. 11(b) of the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>, that the verdicts
    are unreasonable and that the trial judge failed to properly instruct the
    jury with respect to a beating incident recounted by one complainant (J.M.)
    and with respect to possible collusion.&nbsp; He also appeals the sentence.</p>
  <p><b>The s. 11(b) application</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge found that the length of the delay in this case, 30 months (from
    the date of arrest and including the preliminary hearing and the s. 11(b)
    application to the date that the trial began), was sufficiently lengthy to
    warrant closer inspection.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;</span>In
    comprehensive reasons, the motion judge took into consideration all of the <i>Morin</i> guidelines
    (see <i>R. v. Morin </i>(1992), 71 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.)) in arriving at
    his conclusion.&nbsp; In particular, he addressed the time requirements for
    intake, obtaining and instructing counsel, preparation and disclosure.&nbsp; He
    also considered the failure to have witnesses available, the underestimation
    of the time required to examine witnesses, and the failure to obtain transcripts
    for the s. 11 (b) application resulting in an adjournment and the change
    in the trial date.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge refused to treat the guidelines of the Ontario Court of Justice
    as fixed guidelines.&nbsp; He emphasized that it is the reasonableness of
    the entire period in issue that is to be considered.&nbsp; In <i>Morin</i> the
    court made it clear that the purpose of the suggested period was not that
    it was to be treated as a limitation period and inflexible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;</span>In
    the end, the motion judge concluded that this was a close case.&nbsp; He
    arrived at a total of 19 months of delay, with part of that delay caused
    by the Crown and by the lack of institutional resources in the system.&nbsp; In
    these circumstances, he recognized that, as the case was close, the assessment
    of prejudice was critical.&nbsp; He balanced the nature and extent of the
    prejudice of the delay to the appellant against the other interests at issue.&nbsp;
    He found that the extent of the overall prejudice did not weigh in favour
    of granting a stay and that the delay was not unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    note that this was not a simple case.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were two sets of
    charges (requiring two sets of disclosure), involving 6 complainants.&nbsp; The
    charges dealt with incidents alleged to have occurred over a span of 30 years.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;</span>The
    motion judge was in the best position to decide this issue and we are not
    persuaded that his calculation of the relevant periods of time was unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;</span>We
    would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p><b>The unreasonableness of the verdicts</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant submits that there was no rational basis upon which the jury could
    find him guilty of the lesser-included offences of assault on J.M. and that
    the nature of the evidence did not support either the trial judge’s instructions
    or the result.&nbsp; It is the Crown’s position that it was open to the trial
    judge to leave to the jury the question of whether the abusive behaviour
    alleged by J.M. amounted to indecent or common assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;</span>In
    our view, the verdict of assault on Count 4 – an act of gross indecency,
    specifically, fellatio – is unreasonable.&nbsp; There is no rational basis
    for an assault conviction on this Count, as the evidence simply does not
    support the verdict.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;</span>However,
    with respect to the other assault convictions, the trial judge properly instructed
    the jury on how to treat the evidence of witnesses and told the jury that
    it could accept all, none or part of the evidence of a witness.&nbsp; In
    our view, there was a rational basis for the jury to reach the verdicts of
    assault in this case; the facts of the case support the jury’s findings of
    assault.&nbsp; The alleged abusive incidents described by J.M. are consistent
    with either indecent assault or common assault depending on the jury’s appreciation
    of the evidence.&nbsp; If the jury rejected the sexual nature of the assaults,
    the evidence amply supported the lesser-included offence of assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;</span>Although
    this is not determinative of the issue, we note that counsel did not object
    to the trial judge’s instruction on assault as an available lesser-included
    offence.&nbsp; On the contrary, at the Pre-Charge Conference, counsel made
    it quite clear that he wanted the instructions to deal with the lesser-included
    offences and that this was a matter to be decided by the jury. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;</span>While
    we find the verdict of assault on Count 4 unreasonable, the other assault
    verdicts are not unreasonable.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The alleged beating incident
      involving J.M.</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;</span></b>The
    appellant takes issue with the adequacy of the trial judge’s instructions
    with respect to J.M.’s allegation in her evidence that the appellant had
    beaten her when she was a teenager.&nbsp; She had reported the incident to
    the police at the time, but her parents persuaded her to drop the charges. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;</span>We
    agree with the Crown that this was not a case where impermissible propensity
    reasoning was a real danger.&nbsp; The trial judge allowed the appellant
    to be cross-examined on this incident “to the point of credibility only,
    or perhaps the state of mind and the perception of each of them with respect
    to the relationship”.&nbsp; He made it clear to the jury that the appellant
    was not charged with this incident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Again,
    we note that defence counsel did not object to the charge and he made use
    of this evidence to attack J.M.’s credibility.&nbsp; More importantly, we
    have no doubt that, in the context of J.M.’s evidence, the appellant did
    not suffer any prejudice arising from the evidence of this one incident.</p>
  <p><b>The trial judge failed to instruct the jury on collusion</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge properly instructed the jury on how it should consider the evidence
    in this case.&nbsp; This was not a case where the Crown relied on similar
    fact evidence.&nbsp; At the request of defence counsel, the trial judge instructed
    the jury to independently review the evidence of each assault and ensured
    through his instruction that the jury would not infer that a pattern of similar
    fact evidence existed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge did not think that there was any evidence of collusion and he
    refused to instruct the jury on the issue.
    &nbsp;&nbsp;We agree that there was no foundation in the cross-examinations
    of the complainants to give an air of reality to the defence allegation of
    collusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    see no error on the part of the trial judge on this issue.</p>
  <p><b>The sentence</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is conceded that the trial judge did not err in his refusal to impose a conditional
    sentence and a conditional sentence is not appropriate at this time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was convicted of serious offences involving abuse of his family
    members.&nbsp; His criminal record extends from 1971 to 1997 and consists
    of some 27 offences for which he has spent the maximum of 45 days incarcerated.&nbsp; He
    has re-offended five times while bound by probation orders.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;</span>The
    trial judge applied the proper sentencing principles and took all relevant
    factors into consideration.&nbsp; The global sentence imposed was fit.</p>
  <p><b>Disposition</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons the appeal is allowed and the conviction on Count 4 is quashed.&nbsp; The
    sentence imposed for that Count was thirty days, concurrent to the sentence
    imposed for the other offences.&nbsp;
    The disposition of Count 4 does not affect the global sentence.&nbsp; In
    all other respects the appeal is dismissed.</p>
