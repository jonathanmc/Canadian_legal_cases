      of Justice Bernard J. Manton of the Superior Court of Justice dated May

  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    order under appeal dated May 15, 2006 set aside a final order made on consent
    on the basis of a purported settlement of all issues in matrimonial litigation,
    including custody and access, and ordered that the parties proceed to trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    order is a final one because it disposed of the appellant’s substantive right
    to a determination of all issues on the basis of the claimed settlement:  <i>Bachman
    Trust Co. v. Singer</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 612 (
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Ont. Div. Ct. ).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> A
    motion judge possesses the same residual power described in <i>Scherer v.
    Paletta</i>, [1966] 2 O.R. 524 to refuse to give effect to a settlement agreement
    reached between counsel as does a judge before whom such a settlement is
    first placed.  It is a discretion that must be exercised with great care.  We
    are of the view that the necessary foundation for its exercise was lacking
    in this case.  The respondent’s affidavit upon which the judge concluded
    he had not consented to the settlement was feeble at best, the respondent
    failed to provide an adequate explanation for the 5 1/2 month delay in bringing
    his motion, the motion was served on an emergency basis while the appellant
    was away on a business trip, and both parties were unrepresented.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    respondent, in his supporting affidavit, deposed only that his solicitor
    did not consult him in regard to “the final document”    submitted to the
    court. This was the draft order on consent which the appellant approved as
    to form and content that was submitted to the court for signature on November
    4, 2005.  Pointedly, the respondent did not swear that he had no knowledge
    of his solicitor’s letters offering to settle, that these letters had been
    sent without his approval, or that he had in any way limited his solicitor’s
    authority.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Though
    the respondent learned on November 9, 2005 that the draft order had been
    submitted to the court and the order had been signed on November 10, 2005,
    the respondent did not move to set it aside until April 24, 2006. He addressed
    the delay only in vague and general terms.  In the interim he never notified
    the appellant the consent order had been obtained without authority. Rather,
    during the interim he exercised access in accordance with the order’s terms.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    appellant’s affidavit indicated that the respondent had served his motion
    on April 24, 2006 on short notice knowing that she was away on business from
    April 24-27.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In
    these circumstances, and given the serious aspersion cast on the respondent’s
    solicitor, the motion judge required more definitive information as to the
    respondent’s solicitor’s instructions and actions to justify the exercise
    of his discretion.  The meagre evidence before the court did not provide
    an adequate basis for setting aside the final order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    appeal is allowed and the order is set aside without prejudice to the respondent
    renewing his motion, if he so wishes, on better and more complete material.
    Costs are fixed in favour of the appellant in the amount of $10,000 inclusive
    of disbursements and GST.</p>
