  <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant pleaded guilty to and was convicted on four charges: one count
    of break and enter with intent to commit murder; two counts of knowingly
    uttering a threat to sexually assault and cause death; and one count of criminal
    harassment. The appellant appeals his convictions, submitting that the sentencing
    judge erred in dismissing his application to withdraw his guilty plea. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In
    addition, the appellant appeals the finding that he is a dangerous offender
    and the sentence of indeterminate detention. He argues that the sentencing
    judge erred by failing to consider whether he could be controlled by community
    supervision before declaring him a dangerous offender. In his written factum,
    the appellant further submitted that the sentencing judge erred by misapprehending
    the significance of his diaries.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      For
    the reasons that follow, I conclude that the guilty pleas were valid and
    properly accepted and relied upon by the sentencing judge. I also conclude
    that although the sentencing judge erred by failing to consider the long-term
    offender provisions of the <i>Criminal Code </i>before imposing an indeterminate
    sentence, there was no reasonable possibility that a different sentence would
    have been imposed but for the error. Accordingly, the appellant has suffered
    no prejudice and it is appropriate for this court to apply the curative proviso.
    Finally, I note that the sentencing judge’s reasons make no reference to
    the appellant’s diaries. Moreover, during oral argument before this court,
    the appellant abandoned this ground of appeal. I would therefore dismiss
    the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>FACTS</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>    The
    appellant, who was twenty-five years old at the time, was arrested in the
    early morning hours of May 9, 1997 on the premises of a group home for mentally
    challenged adults.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>    P.W.,
    an employee of the home, was working the 11:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. shift on
    the night in question. At about 3:45 a.m. she heard a noise and went to investigate
    its cause. When she looked into the kitchen she saw the appellant standing
    in an open window. She knew that just prior to this, the window had been
    closed and the venetian blind down. P.W. recognized the appellant as the
    same man who had broken into this same group home on February 6, 1991 and
    sexually assaulted her. In respect of that incident, the appellant was convicted
    of sexual assault and sentenced to five years imprisonment. He served the
    full five-year sentence and was released on April 28, 1997 – only eleven
    days before he returned to the scene and the victim of his prior offence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    seeing the appellant, P.W. began to scream and pushed a panic alarm button
    that she had worn around her neck since the previous incident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fortunately,
    the police responded almost immediately and the appellant was arrested at
    about 4:00 a.m. on the northwest corner of the group home property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant indicated that he wished to speak to counsel and was given the
    opportunity to speak privately with two different lawyers before giving a
    videotaped statement to the police later that morning.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    that statement he told police that he intended to break into the group home
    and do “the same thing as last time, except I wouldn’t have left [P.W.] alive.
    Last time I was caught for this, I broke in and raped [P.W.]. That was in
    1990 or 1991. I went to jail in 1992. I should have killed [P.W.] the first
    time.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the same statement the appellant also threatened to rape and kill two female
    police officers who were present at the police station at the time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    May 26, 1997, the appellant was remanded in custody for a sixty-day psychiatric
    assessment at the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Oak Ridge facility of the Mental Health Centre Penetanguishene (“Penetanguishene”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the assessment, the appellant was returned to the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Cornwall jail to await trial. While in custody there, he repeatedly telephoned
    P.W., sometimes identifying himself as “the Rider”. He also wrote P.W. a
    threatening letter. This continued conduct on the appellant’s part, from
    August 1997 through November 1997, formed the basis for the criminal harassment
    charge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>PLEA AND SENTENCING</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    January 21, 1999, the appellant entered pleas of guilty to the four charges.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant discharged his first counsel because he wanted to plead guilty
    and she advised him not to. He retained a second counsel who also cautioned
    him against pleading guilty. The appellant did not dispute the facts, save
    for a few minor details relating to the specific locations where he had earlier
    spent time in custody. He admitted committing the offences alleged and told
    counsel he wanted to plead guilty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant told counsel he needed treatment and wanted to serve any sentence
    imposed upon him at Penetanguishene. He was advised of the consequences of
    his guilty pleas, the Crown’s intention to seek a dangerous offender designation<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> and the consequences if he was found to be a dangerous
    offender.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant signed an authorization to enter a guilty plea and formally admitted
    all elements of the offences. He indicated he was fully advised about alternative
    courses of action, about the possible consequences of guilty pleas and the
    maximum penalty that could be imposed upon him, namely an indeterminate sentence.
    Defence counsel had explained that an indeterminate sentence could mean life
    imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    defence counsel testified that the appellant understood the process and the
    advice given. After the pleas were entered, the Crown filed his Notice of
    Intention to have the appellant declared a dangerous offender. The appellant
    was remanded for psychiatric assessment and consented to the assessment at
    Penetanguishene. The case was adjourned to May 4, 1999.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the interim, the appellant discharged his second counsel and retained a third.
    On May 4, 1999, that defence counsel brought an application to withdraw the
    guilty pleas. That application was dismissed. The sentencing judge concluded
    that the appellant met the criteria for a dangerous offender designation
    and imposed an indeterminate sentence.</p>
  <br clear=all>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are two issues of substance raised on this appeal:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.         Did the sentencing judge err in law
    by dismissing the appellant’s application to withdraw his guilty pleas?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.         Did the sentencing judge err in law
    by failing to consider whether the appellant could be controlled by community
    supervision before declaring him a dangerous offender?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third issue raised by the appellant is whether the sentencing judge erred
    in law by misconstruing the significance of the appellant’s diaries, which
    contained a record of his violent thoughts and fantasies but did not record
    past conduct or future intentions. The sentencing judge makes no reference
    whatsoever to the appellant’s diaries in his reasons.  Accordingly I would
    reject this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>ANALYSIS</b></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      his affidavit sworn in support of his application to withdraw his pleas
      of guilty the appellant stated:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>2.         On January 21, 1999,
      I plead guilty to a number of charges on the assumption that I would be

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      law was well-stated by Doherty J.A. in this court’s decision in <i>R. v.
      T. (R..)</i> (1992), 17 C.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 247 at 252:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>To constitute a valid guilty plea, the plea must
    be voluntary and unequivocal. The plea must also be informed, that is the
    accused must be aware of the nature of the allegations made against him,
    the effect of his plea, and the consequences of his plea. [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence concedes that the pleas were both voluntary and unequivocal. Counsel
    argues, however, that the pleas were not informed because no one told the
    appellant that he would not be serving his sentence at Pentanguishene if
    he pleaded guilty, nor that he would not be released from that facility in
    five to ten years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    the time he entered his pleas before the sentencing judge, the appellant
    had been represented by two experienced defence counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    note that in his affidavit the appellant does not say that he was misinformed
    about the consequences of pleading guilty in relation to where he would serve
    his sentence. He says he pleaded guilty “on the assumption” that he would
    be sentenced to Penetanguishene for five to ten years. Further, and in a
    similar vein, the following exchange between counsel and the court took place
    during the hearing of the appellant’s application to withdraw the pleas:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>MR. ENGEL: But he’s not saying – Mr. Saddlemire
    did not say, “I’m pleading guilty and I know that I may spend the rest of
    my life in Kingston Penetentiary.”  If he said that then I can’t make this
    argument. He anticipated going to Penetanguishene for the five to ten year
    period and …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE COURT:            I know but that’s only in
    his own mind.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>MR. ENGEL: Granted, granted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    only reasonable conclusion one can draw from this exchange is that no one
    ever directly told the appellant or led him to believe he would serve his
    sentence at Penetanguishene. He simply assumed it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    conclusion is supported by the evidence of Julie-Ann Barrett, who represented
    the appellant before his pleas were entered. Ms. Barrett had advised the
    appellant to plead not guilty and said that she explained to him the consequences
    of a successful dangerous offender application, including “[t]hat it would
    mean an indeterminate imprisonment and any release would be determined by
    another body many years in the future in all likelihood.” Ms. Barrett said
    that she was sure she would not have used the term “indeterminate” with the
    appellant but rather was sure that she used the  term “for life”, a lay term
    that he would understand.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
    did not recall raising the issue of placement with the appellant, but understood
    that he was anxious to serve any sentence imposed at Penetanguishene. Although
    she never told him explicitly that he would not be sent to Penetanguishene
    if he pleaded guilty, neither did she say anything to encourage him in the
    belief that he would serve his sentence there. According to Ms. Barrett,
    at no point did she understand or communicate that a dangerous offender designation
    would mean incarceration for only five to ten years. She was of the view
    that the appellant was aware he was looking at a very substantial period
    of incarceration. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Barrett was replaced by Geraldine Castle-Trudel as counsel, who acted for
    the appellant at the time that the pleas were entered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Castle-Trudel’s evidence mirrors that of Ms. Barrett in several important
    respects. The appellant also told Ms. Castle-Trudel that he wanted to go
    to Penetanguishene, and she agreed to speak to the Crown and arrange a consent
    suggestion that the court recommend that he have his sixty-day assessment
    at Penetanguishene. She did not, however, get to a stage in her discussions
    with the appellant about where he would serve any sentence imposed, nor did
    the appellant indicate to her that he was pleading guilty so he could get
    to Penetanguishene. Ms. Castle-Trudel also told the appellant that if he
    pleaded guilty, the maximum penalty to which he would be liable was an indeterminate
    sentence, which, she explained, meant he could spend the rest of his life
    in jail.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his reasons, the sentencing judge noted that when the pertinent facts were
    read into the record by the Crown at the time the appellant entered his pleas,
    the appellant’s only disagreement with those facts concerned a minor detail
    with respect to the institutions where he had spent his previous time in
    custody. The sentencing judge observed that at the time he entered his pleas,
    the appellant was represented by able and competent counsel. He remarked
    that this was the first time in his experience where an accused wished to
    withdraw a guilty plea because the location where the sentence would be served
    was not the one the accused had in mind. The sentencing judge concluded his
    findings by adopting as his own the words of  Doherty J.A. of this court
    in <i>R. v. T.(R.)</i>, <i>supra</i>: “the total record before this court
    leaves no doubt that the pleas were valid in every relevant sense.”</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    predicate offence upon which the dangerous offender application was based
    was committed in May 1997, only a few months before the proclamation of the
    1997 amendments to the <i>Criminal Code</i> that introduced the long term
    offender designation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge, at the time of sentencing, did not have the benefit of
    the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <i>R. v. Johnson</i> (2003), 177
    C.C.C. (3d) 97. The Crown concedes that the sentencing judge erred in holding
    that the appellant should be sentenced under the prior regime without consideration
    of the long-term offender provisions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is also conceded by the Crown that the sentencing judge erred in law when
    he concluded that after the August 1997 amendments the court no longer had
    a discretion regarding terms of the sentence to be imposed on a dangerous
    offender. The sentencing judge erroneously held that under the new regime,
    once an accused is found to be a dangerous offender, he <i>must</i> be sentenced
    to an indeterminate term of imprisonment. In <i>Johnson, supra</i>, at para.
    20, the Supreme Court made it clear that such an interpretation “would introduce
    an unnecessary rigidity into the process and overshoot the public protection
    purpose of the dangerous offender regime.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    because the sentencing judge was of the view that the former provisions of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i> (that is, those in force prior to the August 1997
    amendments) applied, he found that he had a discretion whether to impose
    a determinate or an indeterminate sentence: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The paramount concern in deciding between a determinate
    and an indeterminate sentence is the protection of the public where, based
    on the evidence, the court is not confident that the offender will be cured
    prior to the expiration of an appropriate definite sentence. An indeterminate
    sentence will be imposed unless the actions of the offender can otherwise
    be controlled so as to protect the public.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    concluded his reasons as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am satisfied that the best predictor of future
    behaviour is past behaviour and there are no significant intervening events
    in Mr. Saddlemire’s life to negate the above. I must add that there is no
    evidence of the probability of a cure during the time period of any determinate
    sentence and consequently for the protection of the public an indeterminate
    sentence is the only avenue open to this court on the facts and evidence
    before it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge perceived that he was left with what the court in <i>Johnson</i>,  described
    at para. 44 as “the stark choice between an indeterminate sentence and a
    determinate sentence”. He did not consider the additional possibility of
    a determinate sentence followed by a period of supervision in the community,
    nor did he specifically turn his mind to the long-term offender provisions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the Crown argues that had the sentencing judge considered the long-term offender
    provisions, the sentence would inevitably have been the same based on the
    record before the court. A similar argument was advanced in <i>Johnson</i>,
    in response to which the Supreme Court said at para. 50:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where the error of law consists of the sentencing
    judge’s failure to consider the availability of the long-term offender provisions,
    it is only in the rarest of circumstances, if any, that there will be no
    reasonable possibility that the sentencing judge would have imposed a different
    sentence but for the error. The criteria set out in the long-term offender
    provisions are substantially different from the criteria set out in the dangerous
    offender provisions. Therefore, the evidence and arguments that are relevant
    under the long-term offender application are not precisely the same as the
    evidence and argument that are relevant under the dangerous offender application.
    Absent a thorough inquiry into the suitability of the long-term offender
    provisions at the sentencing hearing, it will be difficult, if not impossible,
    for an appellate court to be satisfied that the sentencing options available
    pursuant to the long-term offender provisions would have been incapable of
    reducing the threat of harm to an acceptable level.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    only question that remains is whether this case is one of those “rarest of
    circumstances” contemplated in <i>Johnson</i>, in which there is no reasonable
    possibility that the sentencing judge would have imposed a different sentence
    but for his error in failing to consider the long-term offender provisions
    of the <i>Code</i>. In my view, this case falls within that exceptional category
    of cases.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was twice psychiatrically assessed in relation to these charges,
    first after his arrest in May 1997 by Dr. Arthur L. Keith at Penetanguishene,
    and then by Dr. R. Ian Hector of the same institution in March 1999 after
    his pleas were entered and before he was sentenced. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Keith’s report was part of a binder filed on consent at the sentence hearing,
    which contained numerous records, including psychiatric and psychological
    reports, completed while the appellant was incarcerated at various institutions
    in the province; case overviews in relation to the current charges before
    the court; copies of the indictments; the appellant’s criminal record; and
    a case overview and reasons for sentence in relation to the previous assault
    on P.W. as well as the pre-sentence report prepared in relation to that charge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All
    these materials were reviewed by Dr. Hector prior to the completion of his
    report. In the conclusion to his report, Dr. Hector stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mr. Saddlemire…meets the criteria of psychopathic
    personality disorder that is the most reliable predictor of recidivism in
    criminal activity. Mr. Saddlemire also meets the criteria for the diagnosis
    of paraphilia: sexual sadism, a condition which is not remediable in the
    present state of scientific knowledge.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>These factors taken in the context of the offence
    history of Mr. Saddlemire lead us to predict a highest level of probability
    of recidivism in respect to further violent interpersonal aggressive behaviour.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>On all of the valid measures for re-offence that
    are currently available to psychiatry, Mr. Saddlemire meets the highest level
    of probability of recidivism. It is relevant to note here that Mr. Saddlemire
    has re-offended while in the secure custody of jail.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, Mr. Saddlemire represents a very serious
    risk of re-offence and a greater danger to the public safety.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his oral testimony, Dr. Hector expanded upon and provided the bases for these
    conclusions. The multi-disciplinary team at Penetanguishene employs a number
    of assessment instruments to diagnose patients, appraise risk, and devise
    treatment strategies. Two of those assessments, the Violence Risk Appraisal
    Guide (“V-RAG”) and the psychopathy check list (“PCL-R”), are performed independent
    of the patient; scores are calculated on the basis of the information contained
    in the patient’s clinical file. The V-RAG is considered a reliable predictor
    of the probability of re-offence and the PCL-R a “very high prognostic indicator
    of a potential for further violent behaviour”. The Research Department at
    Penetanguishene also performs phallometric testing to identify the presence
    of deviant sexual interests. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s score on the V-RAG placed him in the highest of nine categories
    for risk of violent recidivism. The report noted that among mentally disordered
    offenders previously studied, only approximately one per cent obtained higher
    scores than that of the appellant. Moreover, one hundred per cent of those
    in the appellant’s category reoffended violently within an average of ten
    years after release. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant met the criteria for psychopathy as indicated by the PCL-R. In
    two series of phallometric tests, the appellant exhibited a very high magnitude
    of sexual response to scenarios depicting rape and non-sexual violence, as
    well as those depicting consensual sexual activity. The technician who conducted
    the test noted in his report that it was unusual for a non-rapist to exhibit
    the appellant’s pattern of response. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other
    tests revealed that the appellant met the criteria for Antisocial Personality
    Disorder with passive-aggressive traits prominent, and was functioning in
    the borderline range of intellectual ability (Full Scale I.Q. of 72).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    Hector explained the importance of the diagnosis on each axis, and of the
    interaction between them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paraphilia,
    Dr. Hector explained, is a condition in which the individual experiences
    sexual arousal and satisfaction in relation to an object that is inappropriate,
    either by virtue of age or in terms of the nature of the object. Sexual sadism
    is a condition in which the individual experiences sexual arousal and satisfaction
    through the infliction of pain upon a sexual object, and through the infliction
    of humiliating or denigrating behaviours in respect of the object. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Hector’s observations of the appellant confirmed the phallometric assessment
    findings and the diagnosis of paraphilia, sexual sadism. As Dr. Hector testified:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It was interesting listening to him and watching
    him respond to direct questions about his sexual fantasy and about his sexual
    life, and to his pre-occupation longstanding now with images of sexual violence.
    And he, in my judgment of his behaviour, quite readily acknowledged the inappropriateness
    of his own emotional response to the presentation and discussion of such
    imagery. He would beam with obvious delight and then interrupt himself as
    if recognizing that that was not the appropriate thing to be doing when being
    examined by a psychiatrist about sexual fantasy and sexual behaviours that
    might be construed to be ominous and a potential threat to others.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>He acknowledged a life long pre-occupation with
    fantasies of sex and violence, and he acknowledged that he prefers that such
    imagery in most of his conventional entertainment of reading, television
    and movies and so forth. He acknowledged familiarity with and the frequent
    use of pornography involving images that were violent, both sexually violent
    and not sexually violent. And he acknowledged the presence of both sadistic
    that is pain inflicting behaviour with sexual arousal, and masochistic, that
    is the experience of pain as sexually pleasureful and he described male and
    female bondage. He also described voyeuristic behaviours and he acknowledged
    the intent to humiliate or denigrate the female object.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s diagnosis of substance use disorder increases the likelihood
    that he will re-offend, as the use of alcohol makes it very difficult for
    the appellant to control his fantasies and disinhibits him from acting on
    them. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Axis
    II describes underlying personality, which is significant because, as  Dr.
    Hector explained, “clinical prognosis in a general sense in psychiatry is
    very much dependent upon the strength of the underlying personality.” In
    other words, the underlying personality is an important indicator of outcome.
    As noted above, the appellant’s Axis II diagnosis was anti-social personality
    disorder. This, coupled with his high score on the PCL-R, indicates a very
    high risk for re-offence and a less than satisfactory prognosis in relation
    to any program of treatment or rehabilitation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Hector noted that the diagnosis of anti-social personality disorder was made
    only because the diagnosis of psychopathic personality was not available
    under the DSM IV. Dr. Hector characterized a psychopathic personality as
    one that has certain vulnerabilities resulting in a potential for unpredictable
    and often violent acting out. Describing persons with psychopathic personalities
    he remarked:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It’s not that they lack intelligence, it’s not
    that they lack logic, it’s not that they lack social skills, it’s not that
    they lack the capacity to speak with perfect logic and reason, but they lack
    the capacity to conduct themselves with decency and propriety.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Hector observed that persons with psychopathic personalities often exhibit
    an “extraordinary absence of any sense of time guiding and directing their
    behaviour.” He noted that the appellant’s second assault on P.W. was a perfect
    example. He described the dominant feature of the psychopathic personality
    as unpredictability with sudden explosions of behaviour, frequently of quite
    incredible proportion. The psychopathic personality has certain vulnerabilities
    that lead to this potential for unpredictable and often violent acting out.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Hector stated that the combination of demonstrated sexual deviance in the
    presence of psychopathic personality was of particularly great concern. Research
    undertaken at Penetanguishene indicates that individuals who have sexual
    deviance as demonstrated by phallometric testing, together with high pscyhopathy
    scores, will have the highest incidence of recidivism.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant received a score of 50 on Axis V, which reflected his relatively
    high level of functioning, especially in comparison to his level of functioning
    during his previous admission. While this would appear to indicate some improvement,
    Dr. Hector rejected the suggestion that this change had any significance
    in relation to the appellant’s capacity to be rehabilitated. The appellant
    was previously admitted in May 1997 for an initial assessment to determine
    whether he was competent to stand trial and whether a finding of not criminally
    responsible might be available to him. On that occasion, Dr. Hector and other
    members of the assessment team concluded that the appellant was consciously
    exaggerating and feigning symptoms of a major mental disorder, presumably
    in an attempt to reduce his culpability for the charges that had been laid
    against him. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his report, Dr. Hector concluded that the appellant </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>presents a constellation of personality (anti-social
    personality disorder, PCL-R score meeting the criteria for psychopathy),
    psychological  (rehearsal in fantasy),<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"

    use disorder) and social factors…which are known to link to serious interpersonal
    violence, especially towards women.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    Dr. Hector reviewed the social factors that were present in the appellant’s
    family personal history and determined that on all the valid measures of
    potential for re-offence that are currently available to psychiatry, the
    appellant meets the highest level of probability of recidivism.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time that Dr. Hector gave his testimony, the appellant had already fulfilled
    the experts’ prediction that he would re-offend. While in secure custody
    awaiting trial on these charges he committed a series of other offences for
    which he was sentenced to eighteen months in custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Hector had reviewed the warrant expiry release report prepared at Kingston
    Penitentiary immediately before the appellant’s release from custody in April
    1997. That document indicated that the appellant’s score on an actuarial
    predictor of general recidivism (likelihood of committing any indictable
    offence) was moderately high at sixty per cent, while his score on the Statistical
    Prediction of Violent Recidivism by sex </p>
  <br clear=all>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>offenders was much higher,
    and suggested that his risk for violent re-offending was one hundred per
    cent over a seven-year period. As we know, the appellant proved the validity
    of that assessment eleven days after his release. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant participated in two programs for sexual offenders, one at the Regional
    Treatment Centre at the Kingston Penitentiary and another at the Warkworth
    Institution, but was removed from both because he demonstrated inappropriate
    sexual behaviour and program administrators were concerned that he posed
    a risk to female staff. The appellant persisted in threatening and sexually
    inappropriate behaviour despite being treated with both sex hormone suppression
    and anti-depressant (Paroxetine) therapies.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly,
    Dr. Hector was asked how optimistic he was that the appellant would substantially
    benefit from any treatment, and responded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I’m not optimistic at all – I’m afraid to say,
    I’m sorry to say Mr. Saddlemire has three discrete conditions for which medicine
    has, psychiatry has at this moment of history, no effective treatment. The
    paraphilic disorder, sexual sadism is a very serious disorder which obviously
    can lead to very serious physical violence, including murder of women or
    of the sexual object because it doesn’t necessarily involve women as the
    object. There is no effective treatment available for it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Hector explained that a great number of treatments have been tried for those
    diagnosed with paraphilic disorder, sexual sadism, including various kinds
    of psychosocial interventions, as well as the use of sex hormone therapy
    to suppress libido. Outcome research suggests sex hormone therapy is much
    less effective than had been hoped. One of the reasons for its ineffectiveness
    is that it is, in fact, exceedingly effective. This seeming paradox is explained:
    individuals who receive sex hormone therapy report that it suppresses their
    sexual fantasies and libido, but find they cannot tolerate life without sexual
    fantasy and activity and discontinue treatment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    the anti-social personality disorder is not amenable to treatment. Many treatment
    modalities have been tried over the years, but without success. Research
    at Penetanguishene and elsewhere has repeatedly indicated that treatment
    actually makes many individuals worse.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    likelihood that the appellant’s substance use disorder could be treated effectively,
    given his lack of treatment commitment, is quite low. Spontaneous remission
    rates for alcoholism in the community are two per cent; the best treatment
    clinics in the world report remission rates of four percent. The rare individuals
    who are successful are those who are personally committed to treatment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Overall,
    Dr. Hector concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>So if one pools the three things that afflict Mr.
    Saddlemire, in addition to a basic inadequacy of resources, he isn’t very
    bright, he hasn’t got any useful occupational skills, he doesn’t have a lot
    of social support in terms of his community. I think the family, as I understand
    it, have really gone a long way in an effort to provide him some support
    but I think they’ve been exhausted by the burden. If you take the large view
    of it all, Mr. Saddlemire has four seriously limiting factors in terms of
    his prognosis. And I think the potential for rehabilitation, in any meaningful
    sense, is very poor indeed. I think that he will continue to act out, that
    he will continue to represent a very serious risk to adult females, particularly
    vulnerable females. I think that he will continue to exhibit anti-social
    behaviours of a variety of kinds as he has done over the years. I think that
    he will continue to exhibit sexually deviant behaviours, in addition to the
    serious assault, the things that he does acknowledge like voyeurism, frotterism
    and other behaviours that are less intrusive, less threatening, less dangerous
    but nonetheless unacceptable socially. I think that his capacity to gain
    from any treatment even as it’s available at the moment is quite limited
    because he hasn’t the capacity to commit himself over time to the effort
    that’s necessary if you’re going to succeed in psychosocial rehabilitation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relation to repetitive behaviour, he testified as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Well, I see Mr. Saddlemire has actually demonstrated
    very well any concerns about that. Mr. Saddlemire within a very short period
    of time begins to drink and re-offends or at least presents himself in a
    situation where he could well have acted out and it seems clear from his
    own description that he had that intention. That particular event for me
    is compelling evidence that he has the capacity to re-offend and in a repetitive
    fashion. I think the persistence of the sexually inappropriate behaviours
    that – that extends through the whole of his period in custody contributed
    to that also.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>So long as we have evidence of his history, he’s
    been using alcohol since a very young age, he’s been exhibiting significant
    anti-social behaviours through his adolescence, he’s exhibited sexually deviant
    behaviour which appears supported by the instruments that we have, and he
    has two conditions which I believe drives the behaviour, and all of that
    I think suggests that he has a high potential to repeat the behaviours that
    we’ve already seen.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Hector was also questioned about escalating behaviour. After referring to
    the published literature describing the evolution of sexually sadistic behaviour
    with fantasies gradually evolving both in their range and seriousness, he
    had this to say about the appellant:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I think we have good evidence of that with Mr.
    Saddlemire. I mean I see no reason to disbelieve what he was so strenuously
    cautioned about saying when he was being initially interrogated that he was –
    had an intent to kill somebody. I think Mr. Saddlemire could, in a state
    of intoxication and sexual arousal, act out in a very dangerous fashion.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>So Mr. Saddlemire has demonstrated an escalation
    in both the range and quality of the behaviours towards more intrusive, more
    threatening and more dangerous behaviours. And I think the potential for
    further escalation is a significant risk.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Hector’s evidence was not shaken or changed in any way on cross-examination.
    He confirmed his opinion that the appellant has serious problems that are
    not amenable to treatment, and that any effort to treat him may in fact make
    him worse.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    following exchange between defence counsel and Dr. Hector is significant
    in respect of the issue facing this court:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        So are you saying then, “Just leave him,
    don’t even try to fix Mr. Saddlemire because we could have a more dangerous,
    a worst product afterwards? Is that what you’re telling the court?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        No. No. I certainly wouldn’t like to
    be thought of as saying that. I’m talking about the current state of scientific
    knowledge. I think there’s an enormous amount of work to be done in respect
    to discovering the etiology of these conditions and if we can ever come to
    understand what actually causes them, we might then be in a position of applying
    some remedial treatment.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center;'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I want to maintain an attitude of hope. I certainly
    want to continue research into the subject and like everyone, we hope ultimately
    to provide some treatment but I’m saying at this moment in scientific knowledge,
    I don’t believe there is a demonstrated effective treatment for those conditions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    asked if the appellant was somebody that Penetanguishene could work with
    today, Dr. Hector responded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>No, no, he’s not. And I express that opinion on
    the basis of my – my opinion which is – which incorporates all of the assessments
    done by all of the members of the multi-discipline team.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I would have considerable reservations about accepting
    him into a treatment program because of the nature of the three conditions
    that I referred to. I would have considerable reservations about doing that,
    but I probably would. I mean we do make the effort of treating individuals
    who, on general grounds, one might consider to be treatment resistant or – inaccessible
    to treatment. But on the basis of all the information, I don’t think that
    we have anything to offer Mr. Saddlemire.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Hector was also questioned in relation to the application of “the burn-out
    theory” to the appellant. It was suggested that as individuals like the appellant
    age, their urges to engage in sexually deviant and anti-social behaviour
    tend to decrease, to which Dr. Hector responded,
    “there’s a widespread mythology about that”. He elaborated: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>First of all with respect to sexual behaviour and
    secondly with respect to anti-social behaviour. I mean it’s a commonly held
    belief that people with anti-social personalities tend to diminish in the
    frequency and seriousness of the antisocial behaviour in their forties or
    fifties. There’s no doubt that there is a decline in sexual productivity,
    libido, whatever, with advancing age but it most certainly does not disappear.
    And sexually deviant behaviour most certainly does not disappear with advancing
    age. I have seen individuals commit sadistic crime with homicide at advanced
    age so the impulse to act out in these fashions does not decline or disappear
    with age.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he rather simple view that as one gets more
    mature or less aggressive or less dangerous <i>ipso facto</i> by virtue of
    age is not supported.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Hector was also queried about the appellant’s
    “Ghost Rider” or “Rider” persona and what, if any, significance it had. The
    appellant had referred to himself by those names while he was under assessment,
    and when he made threatening telephone calls. Dr. Hector did not consider
    the appellant to be suffering from multiple personality disorder. The only
    significance he ascribed to the appellant’s “Ghost Rider” persona was that
    it provided the appellant with an easy way to avoid accepting personal responsibility
    for his own behaviour by pawning it off on another identity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    asked if he had had any success in treating people like Mr. Saddlemire, Dr.
    Hector replied:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>No, I’m sorry to say I have not. I’ve had the rather
    discouraging task of representing men at review boards annually and making
    statements like I’ve made today about those individuals.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    was also asked whether he could be confident that the appellant would be
    able to follow probationary conditions that might afford some assurance of
    public safety. He responded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>No. I’m afraid my answer to that question has to
    be, no, and a categorical, no. The reason for that is the underlying personality
    disorder psychopathy…[T]hat disorder is a serious handicap because what it
    does…is limit the individual’s capacity to contain their behaviour. Impassivity,
    unpredictability, need for stimulation is the dominant characteristic of
    that particular disorder. And the individual can make the most compelling
    presentation of themselves in the sense of committing themselves to follow
    through with some program of treatment and in an instant be behaving differently.
    And I think we – that that was described in the records from the Regional
    Treatment Centre.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Hector’s view is that the appellant acts impulsively and unpredictably. He
    has an anti-social personality disorder and suffers from sexual sadism, as
    well as a substance abuse condition. Under the present state of scientific
    knowledge, the appellant is both unpredictable and untreatable and there
    is nothing that could be done that could reasonably be expected to successfully
    rehabilitate him. The appellant requires protective custody until such time
    as there is available the knowledge and capacity to treat one or more of
    the conditions that lead to his present situation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was no expert psychiatric evidence called by the defence to contradict or
    even respond to Dr. Hector’s views. Following the sentencing judge’s ruling
    on May 5, 1999 dismissing the appellant’s motion to withdraw his guilty pleas,
    the matter was adjourned to June 28, 1999 for hearing of the dangerous offender
    application. There was ample time to speak with or retain a psychiatric expert
    or experts if the defence was of a mind to do so. Moreover, there is no fresh
    evidence application before this court to suggest that psychiatric evidence
    helpful to the appellant’s position was or might be available. I am left
    to conclude on reasonable inference that such evidence does not exist. The
    opinion of Dr. Hector is one that would be shared by other psychiatrists.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is settled that the primary purpose of the dangerous offender regime is the
    protection of the public. As the Supreme Court of Canada noted in <i>Johnson</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    quoting Chief Justice Dickson in <i>Hatchwell v. The Queen</i>, [1976] 1
    S.C.R. 39 at 43:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[29] [T]he dominant purpose of preventive detention
    is “to protect the public when the past conduct of the criminal demonstrates
    a propensity for crimes of violence against the person, and there is a real
    and present danger to life or limb”. Absent such a danger, there is no basis
    on which to sentence an offender otherwise than in accordance with the ordinary
    principles of sentencing. The principles of sentencing thus dictate that
    a judge ought to impose an indeterminate sentence only in those instances
    in which there does not exist less restrictive means by which to protect
    the public adequately from the threat of harm, i.e., where a definite sentence
    or long-term offender designation are insufficient. The essential question
    to be determined, then, is whether the sentencing sanctions available pursuant
    to the long-term offender provisions are sufficient to reduce this threat
    to an acceptable level, despite the fact that the statutory criteria in s.
    753(1) have been met.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the sentencing judge did not inquire into the suitability of the long-term
    offender provisions at the time of sentencing, on the particular facts of
    this case I am of the view that it would have made no difference to his disposition
    if he had. It is clear from Dr. Hector’s uncontradicted evidence that, given
    his particular constellation of anti-social personality disorder, sexual
    sadism, psychopathy and substance abuse disorder, the appellant is untreatable;
    he would be unable to follow any probationary terms that might be imposed;
    and he would almost certainly violently re-offend.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    community can be protected only if the appellant is kept in secure custody.
    Nothing short of that will contain the appellant and safeguard the public’s
    security.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    can only conclude on the record that Mr. Saddlemire’s case falls within the
    category of rare and exceptional cases contemplated by the Supreme Court
    of Canada in <i>Johnson</i>, <i>supra:</i> there is no reasonable possibility
    that the sentence imposed would have been any different had the long-term
    offender provisions been considered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    these circumstances, it is appropriate to apply the curative proviso. The
    appellant has suffered no prejudice and the result would necessarily have
    been the same had the sentencing judge’s error not occurred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    case can be distinguished from <i>R. v. Rathwell</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 2443
    (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), in which the findings of the trial judge did not exclude a reasonable
    possibility that treatment of the appellant could be effective under a long-term
    offender designation. Here the trial judge concluded that a determinate sentence
    was not appropriate and the record clearly discloses that there is no possible
    treatment available for the appellant and no reasonable possibility of eventual
    control at some fixed future date. In this case, unlike <i>Johnson</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    and<i> R</i><i>. v. Ferguson</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 3387 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), the evidentiary record does provide an adequate basis to support the finding
    of dangerous offender and the imposition of an indeterminate sentence. Contrary
    to the appellant’s submission,  Dr. Hector was specifically asked about a
    determinate sentence and the subsequent imposition of probationary terms
    and rejected that possibility as quite unworkable for the appellant. Similarly
    this case is not like this court’s decision in <i>R. v. Robinson</i> (2006),
    212 C.C.C. (3d) 439 where the psychiatric opinions on dangerousness and treatability
    were infected by consideration of inadmissible evidence.</p>
