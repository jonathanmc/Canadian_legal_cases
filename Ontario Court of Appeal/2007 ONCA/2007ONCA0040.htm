  <h2>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, James Randall, was tried by Justice Terrance O’Connor, sitting
    with a jury.  On February&nbsp;14, 2004, he was convicted of first degree
    murder in relation to the death of his common law partner, Jennifer Zumach,
    and sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals from his conviction on three grounds: (1) the trial judge
    erred by failing to give a limiting instruction with respect to one aspect
    of the testimony of the witness Sylvia Girolamo; (2) the trial judge’s limiting
    instruction relating to the testimony of an expert witness, Dr. Toby Rose,
    was inadequate; and (3) the jury’s verdict of first degree murder was unreasonable
    because there was insufficient evidence of planning and deliberation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>The
      appellant asks that this court quash his conviction for first degree murder
      and order a new trial on a charge of second degree murder.  In the alternative,
      he requests that a new trial be ordered on a charge of first degree murder.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(1)       <u>Sylvia Girolamo’s
        testimony</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant contends that Sylvia Girolamo’s testimony that the appellant
      told her on January&nbsp;19,&nbsp;1999 that Ms. Zumach had been missing
      since Friday or
    “somewhere between the 9th, 12th “and “it was probably Monday, the 11th” was
    clearly inaccurate (in her statement to the police on January 19 she said
    that her conversation with the appellant took place “last Friday” which would
    have been January 15) and therefore should have attracted a limiting instruction
    from the trial judge.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
      disagree.  Ms.&nbsp;Girolamo’s testimony about both the actual date and
      the day of the week was, on its face, confusing.  Defence counsel chose
      not to cross&#8209;examine her on this point.  Later, when he expressed
      concern about the possible confusion he was told he could recall Ms.&nbsp;Girolamo;
      he chose not to do so.  The Crown’s reference to Ms.&nbsp;Girolamo’s testimony
      in her closing address was brief and included the comment “You may well
      think that Ms.&nbsp;Girolamo was just, is just wrong on her timing of events.”  Defence
      counsel said nothing about this issue in his closing address.  The trial
      judge showed a draft of his jury charge to counsel.  He proposed to say
      nothing about Ms.&nbsp;Girolamo’s testimony.  Defence counsel did not object.  Crown
      counsel did request a reference to Ms. Girolamo’s testimony; the trial
      judge did not accede to the request.  Finally, there was a good deal of
      evidence that Ms.&nbsp;Zumach was alive on the weekend of January&nbsp;9&#8209;10
      and some evidence that she was alive as late as January&nbsp;13.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Combining
      these factors, we can see no error in the trial judge’s decision to say
      nothing about the component of Ms.&nbsp;Girolamo’s testimony relating to
      the date of her conversation with the appellant.  This is especially so
      in light of the fact that trial judges, who are on the front line in difficult
      criminal trials, are entitled to “considerable latitude in fashioning a
      jury charge that is appropriate to the particular circumstances of the
      case”: <i>R. v. Mahalingan</i>, [2006] O.J. No. 1619 at para. 15 (

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(2)       Dr.&nbsp;Toby Rose’s
      testimony</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Rose, a forensic pathologist, testified for the Crown.  During her examination-in-chief,
    she testified that, in her opinion, the cause of death was a “blunt force
    head injury”, caused by “being struck in the head by a hammer”.  However,
    she noted that there was no way to determine medically whether the skull
    fracture that she observed during the autopsy occurred before or after death.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    cross-examination, Dr. Rose admitted that
    “one of the reasons” she concluded the skull fracture occurred before death
    was the fact that the appellant had attempted to cover up and hide the body.  Later,
    she agreed with defence counsel’s statement that it was the “only” reason.  When
    asked, Dr. Rose admitted that she had no expertise in forensic psychiatry
    or human behaviour.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s charge to the jury with respect to Dr. Rose’s evidence was
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Although she acknowledged the depressed fracture
    could have been caused after death, she said it was more likely caused before
    death because Mr. Randall’s conduct of hiding the body supports this conclusion.  Innocent
    people who kill someone accidentally would not hide the body.  They would
    report the accident to the authorities, she presumed.  Although she said
    earlier in her evidence that there were other reasons she could conclude
    the blow came before death, she later agreed with the position put to her
    by Defence Counsel that “… the only reason why you would say that one is
    more likely than the other is because of the actions of the person covering
    up the body”.  She replied “yes”.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>However, Dr. Rose also admitted she was not a forensic
    psychiatrist and has no particular expertise in human behaviour.  Therefore,
    ladies and gentlemen, I would instruct you she cannot give expert opinion
    evidence as to how a person would react after a traumatic death.  <i>You
    should disregard her opinion that the fracture more likely occurred before
    death, if you find she based it only on the hiding of the body.</i>  Consider
    all her testimony on this point and all the other evidence bearing on it.  Use
    your common sense.                                                                                     [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that the trial judge erred in the emphasized passage:
    instead of the instruction “<i>only</i> on the hiding of the body”, the jury
    should have been instructed to disregard Dr.&nbsp;Rose’s evidence <i>to the
    extent</i> that it was based on the evidence relating to the body.  To our
    eyes this is a semantic distinction without a difference.  In our view, the
    trial judge’s instruction “to disregard her opinion” if “she based it only
    on the hiding of the body”, coupled with the review of Dr.&nbsp;Rose’s testimony
    immediately above this instruction, was entirely correct.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We

      143 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).</span></p>

      point, in our view the Crown tendered a substantial body of circumstantial

      death that served as a proper foundation for the jury’s verdict.</span></p>
