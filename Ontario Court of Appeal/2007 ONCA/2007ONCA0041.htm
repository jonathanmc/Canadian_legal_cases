    with discipline offences under the <i>Police Services Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c.&nbsp;P&#8209;15 (the “<i>PSA</i>”).  After his criminal acquittal, P.C.

    Chief’s position is that where there has been no discipline hearing on the
    merits because of an erroneous preliminary decision by the hearing officer,
    the Chief can properly seek judicial review of the decision so that the discipline
    hearing can proceed to a determination on the merits.</p>

      for what happened at the cash register, for his return into the store,
      and for his failure to act immediately to restore the goods to Home Depot
      might reasonably be true.  His evidence in this respect was not shaken
      in cross&#8209;examination.  I am unable to reject his testimony that he
      had an innocent intention and he will, therefore, be acquitted of the charge
      of theft.</span></p>

      December&nbsp;9,&nbsp;2003, the Chief appointed Superintendent Boychuk
      as a hearing officer to conduct the discipline hearing.  The Chief’s authorization
      to Superintendent Boychuk stated in part:</span></p>

      parties, as well as an impartial legal opinion permitted by s.&nbsp;69(14)

      on the basis of abuse of process.</span></p>

      out of the same conduct were not inherently incompatible:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>As a general rule well supported
      in the law, criminal and disciplinary proceedings can flow out of the same

      multiple aspects leading to multiple hearings.  In addition, such multiple
      hearings can take place whether the criminal proceedings have resulted
      in conviction or acquittal (again as articulated in <i>Wigglesworth</i> at
      paragraph 27).</span></p>

      the hearing officer held that the general rule did not apply in P.C.&nbsp;Watson’s
      case.  He carefully reviewed Agro&nbsp;J.’s reasons for acquitting P.C.&nbsp;Watson
      in the criminal trial and concluded that if the discipline hearing proceeded
      it would amount to an impermissible re&#8209;litigation of the essential
      issue decided by the trial judge.  He reasoned:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[T]he central and only real issue
      at the criminal trial was credibility.  And my assessment upon review of
      her Reasons for Sentence [<i>sic</i>] is that Justice Agro, in acquitting
      Mr.&nbsp;Watson, has made a determinative finding with respect to the credibility
      of the witnesses.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Her Honour specifically outlined
      the factors which reflected poorly on the credibility of Ms.&nbsp;Burton
      and in addition found the evidence of Frank&nbsp;Meurer of Mr.&nbsp;Watson’s ‘suspicious
      conduct’ … as highly speculative.  Obviously, under those criteria, it
      would be given little if any weight.  With respect to Mr.&nbsp;Watson,
      she indicated that his evidence was not shaken in cross&#8209;examination
      and she could not reject his evidence that he had an innocent intention.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>As a result … it is my conclusion,
      based on my analysis of the law and the particular facts of this case,
      that in acquitting Carlton&nbsp;Watson, Justice Agro made determinative
      findings with respect to the credibility of the witnesses, which bind me
      as a Hearing Officer in these proceedings.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

      as the Chief’s own decision.  The
    <st1:Street

    Divisional Court rejected this submission.  The court observed that “there

    “the Chief’s concern is to see that there is a decision on the merits” and
    concluded:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The Chief has ultimate responsibility
      for the disciplinary processes that are provided for in the <i>Act</i>.  As
      such, the Chief has a <i>bona fide</i> interest in ensuring that the power
      given to the Hearing Officer to conduct a hearing is properly exercised.  Indeed,
      on the facts of this case, there is no one but the Chief to raise the question
      of whether the processes under the <i>Police Services Act</i> have been
      properly followed.  If the Chief did not have standing, this Court would
      be denied legitimate submissions that assist in our review function.</span></p>

    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court disagreed with the hearing officer’s assessment of the import
    of the criminal trial judge’s assessment of the credibility of various witnesses
    including, especially, P.C.&nbsp;Watson.  The court said:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>However, on a fair reading of
      the trial judge’s reasons, we do not consider that she made a determinative
      positive judicial finding about P.C.&nbsp;Watson’s credibility.  She did
      not clearly state that she accepted P.C.&nbsp;Watson’s evidence, nor did
      she find that his explanation was credible.  She simply found that it might
      reasonably be true, and she could not reject it.  In other words, she could
      not say it was false.  In our view, the trial judge was correctly applying
      the approach to assessing evidence, including an accused’s testimony, approved
      in <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i> (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.), which directs
      a trier of fact to acquit even if he or she does not believe the evidence
      of the accused, if the evidence of the accused gives rise to a reasonable
      doubt about his or her guilt.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

    Divisional Court also rejected the hearing officer’s conclusion that allowing
    the discipline hearing to proceed would amount to re&#8209;litigation of
    P.C.</span>&nbsp;Watson’s acquittal.  The court reasoned:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>To allow the disciplinary hearing
      to proceed does not bring the criminal acquittal into question.  The criminal
      trial and the disciplinary hearing, while focused on the same factual matrix,
      are separate inquires, with distinct purposes and governed by different
      burdens of proof.  Discreditable conduct is set out in section 2(1) of
      the <i>Code of Conduct</i> set out in Part V of O. Reg. 123/98 to the <i>Police
      Services Act</i>.  It includes “acting in a manner likely to bring discredit
      upon the reputation of the police force”.  This is very different from
      the essential elements that constitute the criminal offences of theft and
      possession of stolen property.  As this Court stated in <i>Gillen v. College
      of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario</i>, [1989] O.J. No. 470 (
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address

      core of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court’s reasoning on the standing issue is anchored in its observation
    that “the question of standing as it relates to the Chief of Police should
    not be analyzed on the basis that the Chief is synonymous with the decision&#8209;maker.”  The
    court explained its observation in this fashion:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Rather, pursuant to the <i>Police
        Services Act</i>, complaints about police misconduct must be investigated
        and a report prepared, not by the Chief, but by his delegate (s.&nbsp;64(1)).  On
        the basis of the report, the Chief must decide if the officer’s conduct
        may constitute misconduct.  If so, the Chief shall hold a hearing pursuant
        to s.&nbsp;64(7) of the <i>Act</i>.  However, as noted by the Court of
        Appeal in <i>Canadian Civil Liberties Assn. v.
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario (Civilian Commission on Police Services)</i>, [2002] O.J. No. 3737
    at paras. 59 &amp; 61,
    “the Chief is to investigate, not adjudicate.  That is why the Chief does
    not hold a hearing…The role of the Chief is to decide whether a hearing should
    be held and not what the result of a hearing should be…”  As such, the Chief
    may delegate his or her power to adjudicate the alleged police misconduct
    to a Hearing Officer, pursuant to s.&nbsp;76(1) of the <i>Police Services
    Act</i>, as the Chief has done in this case.</span></p>

      respect, this analysis is grounded in a misreading of key provisions of
      the <i>PSA</i>.  Contrary to the Divisional Court’s analysis, the structure
      and wording of the <i>PSA</i> establish that, once a discipline hearing
      is ordered, the hearing officer will be either the Chief or the Chief’s
      delegate.  Accordingly, when the Chief chooses to appoint a hearing officer,
      the Chief and the hearing officer are synonymous. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

      order to support this conclusion, it is necessary to set out several sections
      of the <i>PSA</i>:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>64(1)  </span><span lang=EN>… the <b><i>chief of police</i></b> shall
      cause every complaint made about the conduct of a police officer, other
      than the chief of police or deputy chief of police, to be investigated
      and the investigation to be reported on in a written report.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN>64(7)  …
    if, at the conclusion of the investigation and on review of the written report
        submitted to him or her, the <b><i>chief of police</i></b> is of the
        opinion that the police officer’s conduct may constitute misconduct,
        as defined in section 74, or unsatisfactory work performance, he or she
        shall hold a hearing into the matter.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN>70(1)  A police officer or complainant may, within 30 days of receiving
      notice of the decision made after a hearing held by the <b><i>chief of
      police</i></b> under subsection 64 (7) or by the board under subsection
      65 (9), appeal the decision to the Commission by serving on the Commission
      a written notice stating the grounds on which the appeal is based.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN>70(6)  The Commission may confirm, vary or revoke the decision being
      appealed or may substitute its own decision for that of the <b><i>chief
      of police</i></b> or board, as the case may be.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN>(76(1) A <b><i>chief of police</i></b> may authorize a police officer … to
      conduct a hearing under subsection 64 (7) or to act under subsection 64
      (11) or (15).      [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It
      is clear from these provisions that the Chief plays two roles in the discipline
      process.  First, he must decide whether a hearing is warranted (s. 64(1)
      and (7)); this is the investigatory step in the process.  Second, the Chief
      is central to the hearing process&nbsp;– either he conducts the hearing
      himself (s. 64(7)) or he delegates the task to a police officer (s. 76(1)).  The
      shared or synonymous identity of the Chief or his delegate <i>qua</i> hearing
      officer is affirmed by the wording of s.&nbsp;70(6) which discusses the
      appellate jurisdiction of the Commission in terms of its review of the
      decision of “the chief of police”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With
      respect, the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court conflated the two steps in the process.  The court referred
    to s.&nbsp;64(7) of the <i>PSA</i> and to this court’s decision in <i>Canadian
    Civil Liberties Association v. Ontario (Civilian Commission of Police Services)</i> (“<i>CCLA</i>”), <i>supra</i>,
    and concluded that the Chief’s role is investigatory.  That is true for the
    first step in the process which culminates in a decision whether a hearing
    should be held.  This is, in essence, the gatekeeper function, and <i>CCLA</i> dealt
    with the Chief’s role with respect to this function.  Unfortunately, the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court extended this analysis into the second stage of the discipline
    process.  The analysis does not fit there because it is clear from the various
    statutory provisions set out above that the Chief has a pre&#8209;eminent
    role in the second stage of the discipline process and that his role is squarely
    adjudicative in nature.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There
      is a second reason why, in my view, the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court’s analysis is flawed.  Section&nbsp;70(1) of the <i>PSA</i> grants
    a right of appeal to a police officer or complainant, but not to the Chief.  In
    my view, it is logical and consistent with the <i>PSA</i> that the Chief
    not enjoy a right of appeal because the Chief is, in effect, the decision&#8209;maker – sometimes
    personally and other times, as in this case, through the police officer he
    appoints to be the hearing officer.  In logic and in policy, if the Chief
    cannot challenge the decision of his delegate by way of appeal, he should
    not be able to mount a similar attack through the vehicle of judicial review.  Such
    an attack “would be allowing that to be done indirectly which cannot be done
    directly”: see

      addition, the absence of a right of appeal for the Chief, and rejection
      of standing for the Chief to challenge a decision of a hearing officer
      by way of judicial review, make sense in light of the Chief’s pervasive
      role in the discipline process.  The Chief is the principal actor in this
      process – he may make a complaint about the conduct of one of his police
      officers (s.&nbsp;64(1.1); he shall cause the complaint to be investigated
      (s.&nbsp;64(1)); he must determine if the impugned conduct might constitute
      misconduct and, if it does, he must hold a hearing (s.&nbsp;64(7)); he
      designates the prosecutor at the hearing (s.&nbsp;64(8)); he decides whether
      to conduct the hearing himself or to authorize another police officer to
      conduct it on his behalf (ss.&nbsp;64(7) and 76(1)); and he must take action
      against a police officer if misconduct is proven at the hearing (ss.&nbsp;64(10)
      and 68(1)).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>If,
      in the absence of an explicit appeal right, the Chief were granted standing
      to review his decision or, as in this case, the decision of a police officer
      he has delegated to hold the hearing on his behalf, it could erode confidence – on
      the part of police generally, those subject to discipline proceedings,
      and the public at large – in the independence and fairness of the discipline
      process.  The <i>PSA</i> reflects principles of fairness and natural justice
      in that it does not allow the Chief, who has control of virtually all aspects
      of the discipline process, to seek to overturn a decision he does not like
      by a hearing officer he appointed.  The Chief concedes that he cannot do
      this by way of appeal; in my view, a proper interpretation of the <i>PSA</i>,
      and considerations of principle and policy, preclude an identical attack
      grounded in judicial review.</span></p>
