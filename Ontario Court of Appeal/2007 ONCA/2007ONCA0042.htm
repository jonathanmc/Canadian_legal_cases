    Thomlison also applies, by way of judicial review, for an order quashing
    the warrant of surrender issued by the Honourable Vic Toews, Minister of
    Justice, on March&nbsp;27, 2006. Little need be said about that application.
    In oral argument, it became clear that its fate is tied to the committal
    order. In order words, if the committal order stands, so too will the surrender
    order; if it falls, so too must the surrender order. No other viable issues
    exist in relation to the surrender order. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    that in mind, I turn directly to the appeal from the committal order. Of
    the several grounds of appeal raised, only one involves a matter of broad
    application. It concerns the test for committal under s. 29(1)(a) of the <i>Extradition
    Act</i>, S.C. 1999, c. 18, following the Supreme Court’s recent decision
    in<i> United States of America v. Ferras</i> (2006), 209 C.C.C. (3d) 353.
    In particular, the question arises – to what extent has <i>Ferras</i> modified
    the test for committal to ensure that it conforms with the principles of
    fundamental justice guaranteed by s. 7 of the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>? </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    that issue, both sides agree that in light of <i>Ferras</i>, extradition
    judges may now assess, at least to some extent, the availability and quality
    of the evidence put forward by the foreign state in support of its request
    for extradition. Prior to <i>Ferras</i>, extradition judges were effectively
    precluded from engaging in that limited weighing. According to the majority
    in <i>United States of America v. Shephard</i>, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 1067, in
    deciding whether the test for extradition had been met – namely, whether
    there was some evidence, on every element of the parallel Canadian crime,
    upon which a reasonable jury, properly instructed, could convict – extradition
    judges could not remove from the “some evidence” basket, evidence that was
    either manifestly unreliable or not realistically available for trial. (See <i>Ferras </i>at
    para. 40.)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Ferras</i> altered
    that. Henceforth, in deciding whether the test for committal has been met, <i>Ferras</i> provides
    that it will no longer be “enough for evidence to merely exist on each element
    of the crime”.  Rather, “[t]he evidence must be demonstrably able to be used
    by a reasonable, properly instructed jury to reach a verdict of guilty” (para.
    46). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therein
    lies the issue that divides the parties in this case, namely, <i>to what
    extent</i> can extradition judges now weigh the evidence in deciding whether
    the test for committal has been met?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant takes the position that in light of <i>Ferras</i>, even if there
    is some evidence, that is both available for trial and not manifestly unreliable,
    on every element of the parallel Canadian crime, upon which a reasonable
    jury, properly instructed, could convict, the extradition judge may nonetheless
    refuse to commit if he or she is of the view that the case against the fugitive
    is weak and the prospect of conviction slim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent, on the other hand, maintains that so long as there is some evidence,
    that is available for trial and not manifestly unreliable, on every element
    of the parallel Canadian crime, upon which a reasonable jury, properly instructed,
    could convict, the test for committal will have been made out, regardless
    of any opinion the extradition judge might have about the strength of the
    case or the likelihood of conviction. The ultimate question of guilt or innocence
    is not for the extradition judge; it is reserved for the trial court in the
    foreign jurisdiction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    reasons that follow, I am respectfully of the view that the respondent has
    accurately stated the law. I am further of the view that the evidence put
    forward by the foreign state, in support of its request for the appellant’s
    extradition, is both available for trial and not manifestly unreliable. Accordingly,
    the appellant’s challenge to the committal order collapses into an assessment
    of whether the available evidence is sufficient to meet the test for committal.
    In my view, it is. For that reason, along with my opinion that the other
    grounds of appeal against the committal order have no merit, I would dismiss
    the appeal. I would likewise dismiss the application for judicial review.</p>

    is reproduced in full below:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>1.         Bruce Barshop is expected to testify to the following: He is an
    attorney by training, but, in 1994 he was president of a company called Mistix,
    a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Home Shopping Network. Mistix was in the
    business of providing reservation and ticketing services for clients. One
    of its clients was the National Park Service. Mistix handled the camping
    reservations and certain other special use fees for a number of the national
    parks in the National Park Service system, including Yosemite, the Grand
    Canyon, and
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Yellowstone. In 1994, Mistix was purchased by GREGORY E.G. THOMLISON, who
    kept Barshop on as Vice President and General Counsel. The company was renamed
    Destinet. GREGORY E.G. THOMLISON installed his brother, Timothy, as president
    of Destinet in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    San Diego,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    California. GREGORY E.G. THOMLISON, however, remained in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    and communicated with the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    San Diego office by telephone, email, and occasional personal visits. Almost
    immediately after GREGORY E.G. THOMLISON took over the company, delays began
    in paying funds over to the clients. At the same time, all funds collected
    on behalf of clients, including the National Park Service, were commingled
    in a single operations account at the Wells Fargo Bank,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    San Diego,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    California. Under the terms of the pertinent contracts, Destinet was required
    to remit balances owed the National Park Service within 10 days of collection,
    and balances owed the California State Parks and Recreation Department within
    2 days of collection. During 1997, the balances were paid over, and became
    current, only on one occasion with respect to both the National Park Service
    and the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    California
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    State Parks and Recreation Department. Later in 1997, as the delays became
    more acute, Barshop, at the direction of GREGORY THOMLISON, intentionally
    lied to the National Park Service about the reasons for the delays. As early
    as the summer of 1997, Barshop suggested the possibility of bankruptcy to
    GREGORY THOMLISON, who rejected the idea at that time. By August 4, 1997,
    however, Destinet stopped remitting any funds to the National Park Service.
    Nevertheless, GREGORY THOMLISON continued to transfer funds after August
    4, 1997, from the commingled account at Wells Fargo Bank in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    San Diego, to the National Bank of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario. On October 9, 1997, Barshop and GREGORY THOMLISON spoke with an
    attorney in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    San Diego for the purpose of filing a bankruptcy petition for Destinet, which
    was filed on October 22, 1997. After the bankruptcy was filed, GREGORY THOMLISON
    never returned to the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    , and was held in contempt by the United States Bankruptcy Court in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    San Diego. Bruce Barshop has identified the attached photograph (Exhibit
    1) of GREGORY THOMLISON, and initialled and dated the back of the photograph.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>2.         Deborah
    Friedman is expected to testify to the following: She lives and works in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Ontario,
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , and has been employed by GREGORY E.G. THOMLISON at two different companies.
    The first was
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Ticketmaster,
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , where she provided accounting services for a company in the business of
    selling tickets for sporting events, clubs, theatres, etc. THOMLISON was
    one of the co-owners of the company. In 1992 or 1993, THOMLISON left the
    company, and thereafter, asked Friedman to join him in his new company as
    Accounting Manager. The new company was, in essence, the Canadian office
    of Destinet. Shortly after taking over the company formerly called Mistix,
    THOMLISON directed that the accounting records, including the cheque book
    on the commingled Wells Fargo Bank account, be moved from
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    San Diego to
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    . Friedman was responsible for monitoring the flow of money in and out of
    the Wells Fargo Account, and became aware that more money was going out then
    was coming in. Friedman also became aware that the National Park Service,
    and other clients, were not receiving their money in a timely fashion, and
    were complaining about that fact. By August 4, 1997, all payments to the
    National Park Service by Destinet ceased. By September 20, 1997, all payments
    to the California State Department of Parks and Recreation ceased. Between
    August 4, 1997, and October 20, 1997, however, at the direction of THOMLISON,

    January 1, 1997, and October 20, 1997, Montgomery-Gowan received about $350,000.)

    individuals who did not work at Destinet, including GREGORY THOMLISON’s wife,
    his gardener, the caretaker for his father-in-law, and the nanny for his
    children. As Accounting Manager, Friedman will testify that the reason why
    the money was not available to pay the National Park Service and the other
    clients of Destinet was because GREGORY THOMLISON used the money for his

    funds into the company and he was in the process of consummating a joint
    venture agreement with a Montreal-based company to resolve Destinet’s “shortfall

    On April 29, 2005, he provided extensive written reasons in which he refused

    It did, however, warrant a lesser sanction. To that end, he ordered that
    Ms. Friedman’s evidence be “excised in all respects”

    his reasons for refusing to stay the proceedings, the extradition judge stated
    that he had “grave concerns about the Friedman evidence that the U.S. Attorney
    summarized not once but twice” and he characterized the supplementary record
    of the case as “a transparent attempt on the part of the requesting state
    to avoid the operation of … s. 32 of the <i>Extradition Act</i> and avoid
    subjecting Ms. Friedman to cross-examination by Thomlison’s counsel”. That
    said, he made a clear finding that the preparation of the supplementary record “was
    not done purposefully to mislead the court, but, was done as a result of
    the ignorance of the U.S. Attorney, in the absence of input from Canadian
    counsel, in not being conversant with the operation of the <i>Extradition
    Act</i>.”</p>

    the same vein, the extradition judge refused to give effect to the appellant’s
    submission that the preparation of the supplementary record “was undertaken
    in a purposeful or ‘insidious’ fashion, done to intentionally mislead the
    Court”. Although he considered the steps taken by the requesting state to
    have been “ill-conceived”, he thought it significant that
    “the U.S. Attorney ultimately agreed to submit Ms.&nbsp;Friedman to cross-examination
    and waived any privilege that might otherwise be associated with the choice
    of methodology, thereby, smartly and rightly, avoiding any long term or irreparable
    prejudice with which the Person Sought was then beset”. </p>

    extradition judge then turned his attention to “the lack of full, frank and
    fair disclosure or the lack of diligence and care in the preparation” of
    the summary of Ms.&nbsp;Friedman’s evidence and “its ultimate impact on the
    integrity and reliability of the certification process”. On that issue, he
    stopped short of finding that the actions of the U.S. Attorney were “purposeful” as
    opposed to “inadvertent or misguided”. That said, he was satisfied that the
    U.S. Attorney “knew or ought to have known that [Ms. Friedman’s] evidence
    was not portrayed in a full, frank and fair manner” and that this rendered “her
    evidence misleading”, something he was not prepared to countenance.  Accordingly,
    he turned his attention to the appropriate remedy and concluded that although
    a stay of proceedings was not warranted, Ms. Friedman’s evidence should be
    excised from the record:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In my view,
    and as has been stated in countless cases, a stay of proceedings should only
    be granted in the clearest of cases, “… where the prejudice to the accused’s
    right to make full answer and defence cannot be remedied or where irreparable
    prejudice would be caused to the integrity of the judicial system if the
    prosecution were continued”. [<i>R. v</i>. <i>O’Connor, </i>(1995), 103 C.C.C.
    (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) at para 82.] While, as I indicated, the court should be ever
    vigilant to insure that the reliability of the certification process is maintained
    at all times, such can be accomplished in this case if the evidence of Ms.
    Friedman is excised, in all respects. The use of the remedy now fashioned,
    which has been adopted in the extradition context [<i>United States of America
    v. Shulman</i> (2001), 152 C.C.C. (3d) 294 at 315 (S.C.C.)], will in my view
    provide the requesting state and its Canadian counsel with a message that
    full, frank and fair disclosure must form the corner stone of the record
    of the case and, minimally, that there is no room for lack of diligence and
    care, even if it were inadvertent or misguided.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    see no basis for interfering with the remedy fashioned by the extradition
    judge. In so concluding, I should not be taken as holding that the remedy
    of excision will be warranted in all cases where disclosure is found to be
    incomplete and misleading. To state the obvious, the appropriate remedy,
    if any, will depend on the facts and circumstances of the particular case.
    Here, as indicated, I am satisfied that the extradition judge did not overshoot
    the mark in fashioning the remedy he did. More to the point, given his findings
    of fact, which I consider to be unassailable, and his correct application
    of the law, I see no basis for interfering with his conclusion that this
    was not an appropriate case for a stay of proceedings. Accordingly, I would

    the stay of proceedings application, the appellant requested, as an alternate
    remedy, that the evidence of both Ms. Friedman and Mr. Barshop be excised
    from the Record of the Case. As noted by the extradition judge, the appellant’s
    position was that Mr.&nbsp;Barshop’s evidence should be excised because “read
    in light of the Friedman oral evidence, [it] was now revealed to be misleading,
    if not erroneous”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    extradition judge refused to give effect to that argument, in part, because
    as the law then stood, he was satisfied that as an extradition judge, he
    was:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>... not permitted
    to assess the evidence even if [he] were of the view that the evidence was
    manifestly unreliable, incomplete, false, misleading or even contradictory
    of other evidence. All that is up to the court at the trial of the person
    requested and does not fall within the jurisdiction of the extradition judge.</p>

line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    support of his position, the extradition judge cited two authorities, one
    being this court’s decision in the <i>United States of America v. Yang</i> (2001),
    157 C.C.C. (3d) 225 at para. 48. Manifestly, his understanding of the law
    was correct as it stood at the time. Since then, however, it has been overtaken
    by <i>Ferras, supra</i>. Hence, if the extradition judge had declined to
    excise Mr. Barshop’s evidence solely on the basis that he lacked the jurisdiction
    to do so, his decision would have been open to review.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That,
    however, is not what occurred. The extradition judge continued his analysis
    and found, as a fact, that even if he had assessed Mr. Barshop’s evidence
    in light of Ms.&nbsp;Friedman’s oral testimony, he would not have excised
    it on account of unreliability:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>That having
    been said, and lest I did not make the distinction clear between my inclination
    to exclude the Friedman evidence in contrast to the evidence of Barshop,
    I deemed the former to be misleading in and of itself and not read in light
    of the evidence of another. I cannot arrive at the same conclusion in respect
    of the Barshop evidence, which is only perceptibly misleading in light of
    what Ms. Friedman testified to. Indeed, and I can only speculate about this
    conclusion, while it is probably unlikely, it may very well turn out that
    Barshop may not have been privy to the matters to which Ms.&nbsp;Friedman
    testified and therefore his evidence, in and of itself was not misleading
    or erroneous.</p>

    is some evidence, that is both available for trial and not manifestly unreliable,
    on every element of the parallel Canadian crime, upon which a jury, properly
    instructed could convict, that is not enough. The extradition judge must
    go on to assess the strength of that evidence. If he or she concludes that

    for the respondent, on the other hand, rejected the notion that <i>Ferras </i>had
    expanded the role of the extradition judge to the extent suggested by the
    appellant. He maintained that so long as there was some evidence, that was
    both available for trial and not manifestly unreliable, on every element
    of the parallel Canadian crime, upon which a reasonable jury, properly instructed,
    could convict, the test for committal was met. In that regard, it mattered

    for the trial court in the foreign jurisdiction, not the extradition judge. </p>

    support of his position, counsel for the respondent cited two post-<i>Ferras</i> decisions
    from the Superior Court of Justice – <i>United States of America v. Huynh</i>,
    [2006] O.J. No. 3730 and the <i>United States of America v. Mach</i>, [2006]
    O.J. No. 3204. In both cases, Beaulieu J. and Trafford J. recognized their
    newly-acquired authority to weigh and discard from the “some evidence” basket,
    evidence that was manifestly unreliable; neither however, interpreted <i>Ferras</i> as
    having conferred the more extensive jurisdiction advocated by the appellant.
    On the contrary, both were satisfied that so long as there was some reliable
    evidence on every element of the parallel Canadian crime upon which a reasonable
    jury, properly instructed, could convict, it mattered not whether there was
    conflicting evidence upon which the trial court in the foreign jurisdiction
    might ultimately acquit. For purposes of committal, it was not for the extradition

    the end, when <i>Ferras</i> is read as a whole and against the backdrop of
    the s. 7 <i>Charter</i> issue – namely, the propriety of depriving persons
    of their liberty and security, by forcibly removing them to another country
    to stand trial on the basis of evidence that is either unavailable and/or
    manifestly unreliable –  I am satisfied that the newly-acquired authority
    conferred on extradition judges is limited in the manner suggested by the
    respondent. Unlike the situation that existed post <i>Shephard</i>, <i>Ferras</i> now
    authorizes extradition judges to assess the availability and quality of the
    evidence that can legitimately be included in the “some evidence” basket
    for sufficiency purposes. In my view, that enables them to discard evidence
    that is not realistically available for trial and/or evidence that is manifestly
    unreliable, i.e. evidence upon which it would clearly be dangerous or unsafe
    to convict. It does not allow extradition judges to refuse to commit where
    there is “available and reliable” evidence in the “some evidence” basket
    upon which a reasonable jury, properly instructed, could convict. <i></i></p>

    coming to that conclusion, I take comfort in the fact that nowhere in <i>Ferras</i> does
    the court set out, in explicit terms, the expanded role of the extradition
    judge suggested by the appellant. On a matter of such importance, I believe
    that if the court had intended to effectively create a new and more stringent
    test for committal, such as, “a reasonable prospect of conviction” or “a
    reasonable likelihood of conviction”, it would have said so explicitly.<i></i></p>

    for trial and not manifestly unreliable, on every essential element of the
    parallel Canadian crime, upon which a jury properly instructed, could convict,
    the test for committal will have been met. In that regard, it matters not
    whether the case against the person sought is “weak” or whether the prospect

    under the terms of Destinet’s contract with them. Significantly, at a time
    when Destinet was on the verge of bankruptcy and either delaying or not paying
    anything to National or California, while intentionally deceiving them as
    to the reason for this, Destinet, through the appellant, was transferring
    large amounts of money from its Wells Fargo account in California to its
    account at the National Bank in Canada. On that evidence, I am satisfied
    that it would be open to a jury to find that but for Destinet’s dishonesty,
    had National and California known the true state of Destinet’s affairs, they
    would have taken steps to secure the funds that Destinet moved to Canada
    between August 4, 1997 and October 20, 1997. As it is, they did not do so
    and those funds were, at very least, put at risk by reason of Destinet’s
    dishonesty. On that scenario, even if the appellant was truly trying to rejuvenate
    Destinet so that it could pay the monies it owed to National and California,
    it is open to debate whether that would afford him a defence if he otherwise
    knowingly exposed National and California to economic risk by intentionally
    misleading them as to the reason why Destinet could not pay them. (See <i>R.
