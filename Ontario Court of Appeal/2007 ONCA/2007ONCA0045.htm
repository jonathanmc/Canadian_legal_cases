      entered on October 6, 2004 and the sentences imposed on November 1, 2004
      by Justice McRae of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury.</span></h4>
  <h2>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dwayne
    Jahton Blair, Andre Blair and Paul Williams were charged with robbery, assault,
    pointing a firearm, forcible confinement and possession of a prohibited weapon.  The
    three were tried by a jury before McRae J. of the Superior Court of Justice.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the Crown’s theory was that the accused had gone to the Williams home,
    armed with guns, looking for an individual named Anthony and demanding drugs.  Anthony
    was Mr. Williams’ nephew.  After being told that Anthony no longer lived
    at the house, the men forced their way into the home, assaulted the homeowner’s
    son and robbed the homeowners.  While in the upstairs part of the house,
    the son and his parents were ordered into the master bedroom and made to
    sit on the bed.  The goods that were to be stolen were found in a plastic
    garbage bag near the front door of the Williams’ home.  They were items of
    clothing belonging to the homeowner’s son.  No money was ever demanded from
    the Williams.  No jewellery, wallets, electronics or anything else of particular
    value was taken or placed into the garbage bag.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All
    three accused advanced the same theory at trial.  There was no robbery. Rather,
    the events occurred as a result of a gun deal gone bad.  The purpose of their
    visit to the Williams’ home was to obtain delivery of a gun from the homeowner’s
    son.  The son had been previously paid $2,000 for the gun.  When they arrived
    at the home, the son let them in.  However, when he did not have the gun
    that had been ordered, an altercation took place between him and one of the
    accused.  In the end, the son gave the accused a bag of his clothing as collateral
    until he could either obtain the gun or refund the money.  His parents lied
    to protect themselves or their son.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial lasted 14 days.  It concluded with all three accused being acquitted
    of robbery, assault and pointing a firearm but convicted of forcible confinement
    and possession of a prohibited weapon.  Prior to sentencing, the Crown stayed
    the forcible confinement charge against Paul Williams.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dwayne
    Blair was sentenced to 18 months in prison in addition to fifteen months
    of pre-trial custody.  He appeals against conviction and sentence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paul
    Williams appeals his conviction.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants raised a number of grounds of appeal.  Of these, the court called
    on the Crown in respect of the trial judge’s alleged failure to properly
    relate the theory of the defence to the jury and to properly instruct the
    jury in accordance with <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i>.  It also called on the Crown
    in respect of Dwayne Blair’s sentence appeal.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE CONVICTION APPEAL </span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Theory of the Defence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are satisfied that the jury was left with a sufficient understanding of the
    key factual issues, the law which relates to those issues and to the evidence,
    the positions of the parties and the relevant evidence.  The trial judge
    adequately explained the elements of the offences and gave a summary of the
    evidence of all witnesses, which included a review of the evidence relating
    to the defence’s failed gun transaction theory.  In their closing submissions,
    counsel for each of the three co-accused fully canvassed the inconsistencies
    and weaknesses in the Crown’s case </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the appellants’ acquittals on three counts demonstrate that the
    jury had been properly exposed to the defence theory.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Instruction on W. (D.) </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    essence of the appellants’ position on this issue is that although the trial
    judge charged the jury on <i>W.(D.)</i>, he erred by failing to tell the
    jury that it had to consider all of the defence evidence, including that
    of the co-accused, when considering the first and second steps in <i>W.(D.).</i>   That
    is, the trial judge compartmentalised the <i>W.(D.) </i>instructions so that
    it was used only for each individual accused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the trial judge did not explicitly state, during his instruction on <i>W.(D.)</i>,
    that the jury should consider the testimony of Paul Williams and Andre Blair
    (Dwayne Blair did not testify), in determining whether the Crown had proven
    its case, a consideration of the full jury charge shows that the trial judge
    clearly instructed the jury to consider all of the evidence, including that
    of the accused who had testified, with respect to each of the accused.  The
    charge is replete with examples of this instruction, a few of which are set
    out now:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>I will only refer to some
    of the evidence.  You will consider all of the evidence, the arguments of
    counsel and my charge …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>If, at the end of the case,
    based on all of the evidence or the lack of evidence, you are not sure that
    they or any of them committed an offence, you should find him or them not
    guilty. …     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>When considering your verdict,
    therefore, do not test each piece of evidence to see if it has been proven
    beyond a reasonable doubt; rather, consider all of the evidence, the totality
    of the evidence that you find credible.  On that basis, decide whether the
    case has been proven. …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>If you are satisfied beyond
    a reasonable doubt on all of the evidence that you have heard that the events
    occurred as described … </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the jury could have been under no misapprehension as to the correct
    burden and standard of proof.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>THE SENTENCE APPEAL</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    sentencing Dwayne Blair, the trial judge stated:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>There is no doubt he [Dwayne
    Blair] is the one that assaulted Paul Williams Junior although he has not
    been convicted of that.  That was the evidence of the defence witnesses as
    well as the Crown witness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    as all of the accused had been acquitted of the assault charge, it was an
    error in principle to impose a sentence that reflects such an offence.  Accordingly,
    this court may intervene and impose a sentence that it deems fit.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dwayne
    Blair was 21 years old at the time of the offences.  He had a youth record.  In
    addition, he had two drug convictions for possession and a conviction for
    obstructing a peace officer.  The longest sentence he had served prior to
    incarceration for these offences was 16 days.  He spent fifteen months in
    pre-trial custody on these offences, for which he was given thirty months
    credit.  He had then been on bail on fairly restrictive terms for a further
    fifteen months.  He then served some five and a half months in custody on
    this sentence before being released on bail.  A consideration of the pre-trial
    custody and time served makes an effective sentence of approximately 3 years.  We
    are satisfied that, in the circumstances of this case, a fit sentence is
    time served and would so order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>DISPOSITION</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeals against convictions are dismissed.  Dwayne Blair’s appeal against
    sentence is allowed and varied to time served.   </p>
