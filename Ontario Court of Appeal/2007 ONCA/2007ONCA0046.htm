    Mallory and Robert Stewart appeal their convictions on February 1, 2000 by
    a court composed of McWilliam J. and a jury.  Mallory was convicted of two
    counts of second degree murder and Stewart was convicted of two counts of
    first degree murder. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants were initially charged together with James Sauvé and Richard Trudel.  In
    the summer of 1995, after the trial involving all four accused had commenced,
    the charges against the appellants were severed. Sauvé and Trudel were each
    convicted of two counts of first degree murder on May 20, 1996.  The appellants’ trial
    commenced shortly thereafter.  The same judge presided at both trials. Sauvé and
    Trudel appealed their convictions and this court allowed their appeals and
    ordered a new trial:  see <i>R. v. Sauvé and Trudel </i>(2004), 182 C.C.C.
    (3d) 321 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), leave to appeal refused [2004] S.C.C.A. No. 246. Some of the grounds raised
    in that appeal are also raised here. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Stewart
    decided to represent himself on this appeal and the court appointed <i>amicus
    curiae </i>to make submissions with regard to the legal issues arising on
    his appeal.  Mallory was represented by counsel (not the same as his trial
    counsel).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants’ trial lasted sixteen months.  The trial was hard fought, marked
    by lengthy examinations, cross-examinations, and even lengthy re-examinations
    of the witnesses and an unfortunate level of acrimony between counsel. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    provide here a brief factual summary that is intended as a general backdrop.  We
    will make further reference to the facts as is necessary to explain our reasons
    on the many grounds of appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the following reasons, we allow the appeal and order a new trial.  In our
    view, the trial judge failed to provide the jury with an adequate caution
    with regard to the disreputable witnesses called by the Crown.  There is
    no meaningful distinction between this case and <i>R. v. Sauvé and Trudel,
    supra</i>, where this court allowed the appeal on this ground.  In addition,
    we have concluded that there were other legal errors meriting appellate intervention,
    including the improper admission of Sauvé’s conviction for manslaughter,
    the improper admission of hearsay evidence of statements from Mallory’s girlfriend,
    the improper editing of Stewart’s statement to a jailhouse informer to exclude
    exculpatory statements, and an erroneous ruling declining to impose limits
    on the Crown’s right to cross-examine Stewart concerning alleged out-of-court
    statements to unsavoury individuals.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    we are allowing this appeal on a number of grounds, we want to acknowledge
    that this was a long and complex trial involving a number of discrete and
    difficult issues.  We have attempted to approach this case bearing in mind
    the number of challenges faced by the experienced and well-respected trial
    judge, challenges made more difficult by the level of animosity between counsel. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>FACTS</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is common ground that Stewart was a high-level drug dealer in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Ottawa area and Mallory was his enforcer.  Trudel was a drug dealer associated
    with Stewart and Sauvé was his enforcer. The two victims were Michel Giroux,
    a low-level drug dealer, and Manon Bourdeau, his pregnant wife.  The victims
    were killed in their home in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Cumberland, near
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ottawa, by someone using a shotgun.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown’s theory was that Giroux owed money to Stewart and that Stewart ordered
    the killings to set an example for other drug dealers who owed him money.  The
    Crown’s position was that Denis Gaudreault drove the four men – the appellants,
    together with Sauvé and Trudel – to Giroux and Bourdeau’s home.  Stewart
    remained in the car with Gaudreault.  Sauvé, Trudel, and Mallory went inside
    to kill the victims.  Sauvé was said to be the triggerman.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was no forensic evidence linking the appellants to the crime scene.  The
    appellants disputed any connection between the Stewart and Trudel drug ring
    and Giroux and Bourdeau.  The Crown’s case essentially rested on the testimony
    of three witnesses: Denis Gaudreault (also the Crown’s key witness at the
    Sauvé and Trudel trial), Michael Winn, and John Smallwood.  As in <i>R. v.
    Sauvé and Trudel, supra</i>, there was other evidence supporting the Crown’s
    case, but much of it was subject to its own significant frailties. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gaudreault
    testified that he supplied weapons at Stewart’s request, drove the four men
    to the road near the victims’ house, waited in the car with Stewart while
    the other three went into the house to kill the victims, and then drove all
    four back to Stewart’s house.  Michael Winn, who had met the appellants in
    jail, claimed that they made inculpatory statements to him about their involvement
    in the killings.  John Smallwood, another jailhouse informant, recorded conversations
    with Stewart in which Stewart made a statement, parts of which were arguably
    inculpatory while other parts were exculpatory. The trial judge admitted
    the allegedly inculpatory portions of the statement and excluded the exculpatory
    portions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gaudreault’s
    testimony was central to the Crown’s case and, as explained below, the appellants
    strongly attack the credibility and reliability of his evidence.  Gaudreault’s
    evidence provided a link between Stewart and the victims, a motive for the
    murders, and his own account of the crime as an accomplice.  He testified
    that he had seen Giroux with Trudel and Stewart on several occasions and
    that in December 1989 and January 1990 Stewart was very agitated and concerned
    about money, his debts, and the debts owed to him by others.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gaudreault
    testified that in late 1989 and early 1990 he owed a substantial amount of
    money to Stewart as a result of his dealing in and consuming of drugs.  Gaudreault
    testified that in November and December 1989, as his debts with Stewart were
    mounting, Stewart and Stewart’s associate, Michael Vanasse, told him they
    were tired of people owing them money and that an example would soon be made.  Shortly
    after Christmas they told Gaudreault that he would be reading about such
    an example in the newspaper. Another of Stewart’s drug dealers, Jamie Declare,
    testified that in mid-December Stewart complained about a couple that owed
    him money and were resistant to paying it back. Declare also testified that
    Stewart told him that Vanasse wanted Gaudreault killed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gaudreault
    testified that on January 9, 1990, he overheard Stewart yelling into the
    telephone, “if you think you’re going to get away with this, you and your
    old man, you got something coming”.  After the telephone call, Stewart told
    Vanasse that it was “that fucking bitch from
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Cumberland”.  The Crown theorized that Stewart was referring to Bourdeau.  Stewart
    said he was going to have Mallory deal with the problem and a meeting was
    set up for later that afternoon.  Gaudreault attended this meeting along
    with Trudel, Vanasse, and the appellants, but was not privy to any planning
    that may have occurred. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gaudreault
    testified that Stewart and Vanasse visited him on the morning of January
    16, 1990.  They wanted money from him and complained about dealers like Gaudreault
    who were not settling their debts. Stewart said, “pretty soon they were going
    to make an example and [Gaudreault] could read about it.”  After Stewart
    and Vanasse departed, Gaudreault and Declare smoked crack all afternoon until
    the evening when they ran out of drugs.  Gaudreault then returned home.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once
    Gaudreault arrived home he received a call from Stewart, who asked for a
    ride and for Gaudreault to bring the “tools”, his term for firearms and ammunition,
    that he stored for Stewart in the basement of his home. About 15-20 minutes
    later, Trudel, Sauvé, and the appellants arrived at Gaudreault’s home.  Gaudreault
    was told he would drive a white Cadillac.  Gaudreault brought up a bag of
    firearms from the basement, including a sawed-off shotgun, which on the Crown’s
    theory was the murder weapon and a .223 rifle which the Crown claimed was
    taken by Mallory.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was evidence adduced at trial linking Sauvé, Trudel, and the appellants with
    a white Cadillac:  Sauvé owned a white Cadillac, Trudel had been seen driving
    the vehicle, and Stewart and Mallory’s fingerprints were found in that car.  According
    to Gaudreault, Stewart directed him to drive the white Cadillac to the home
    of the deceased in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Cumberland where he dropped off Sauvé, Trudel, and Mallory.  Gaudreault testified
    that he and Stewart drove off but returned a few minutes later to pick up
    the other three. On the way back to Stewart’s house, Stewart asked how it
    went and someone said there was “no problem” and that a television had been
    left on.  Mallory put the weapons in a bag and Gaudreault said that he heard
    noises, like metal hitting glass, suggesting that Sauvé was throwing spent
    shotgun shells out the window.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    they reached Stewart’s house, according to Gaudreault, Trudel told Stewart, “No
    problem.  He got it twice and the bitch got done in the back”.  This statement
    corresponded with the cause of death – Giroux had been shot twice and Bourdeau
    had been shot once in the back.  Stewart told Gaudreault he would reduce
    his debt by $2,000 and asked him to pay Sauvé and Trudel $10,000 out of money
    Gaudreault owed Stewart. Gaudreault testified that Stewart then had his wife,
    Linda Beland, drive Gaudreault home. Beland testified for the Crown but could
    not recall whether she had driven Gaudreault home. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    he arrived home, Gaudreault cleaned and reloaded the guns.  He noticed that
    there were three shells missing from the shotgun.  In earlier statements
    to the police he contradicted himself about the number and colour of the
    missing shells.  After putting the guns away, Gaudreault went to Declare’s
    house and spoke with him.  Gaudreault relayed the incident to Declare who
    concluded that Gaudreault went on a hit.  Declare confirmed that one night
    around 11 p.m. he had a similar conversation with Gaudreault, although there
    were some discrepancies between his recollection and Gaudreault’s testimony.  In
    the following days, Gaudreault made the requested payments to Sauvé and Trudel.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    January 22, 1990, a few days after the killings, Stewart and Vanasse visited
    Gaudreault’s house.  Gaudreault testified that Stewart produced a newspaper
    article about the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Cumberland killings and said, “That’s what happens to assholes when they
    don’t pay up” and that he “didn’t know the bitch was pregnant”.  Several
    people who, according to Gaudreault, witnessed this event testified that
    it never happened.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    January 31, 1990, Gaudreault and the members of his household departed from
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Ottawa.  At the time Gaudreault still owed Stewart $13,000 and also took
    with him a large quantity of Stewart’s hashish. Before leaving
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Ottawa, Gaudreault told his sister, Sylvie Gravelle, that Stewart was involved
    in the murders of Paulo Trudel (Trudel’s brother) and Denis Roy.  When Sylvie
    Gravelle asked about the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Cumberland killings, Gaudreault said that the four murders were all connected.  It
    was agreed at trial, however, that both the Trudel and Roy deaths were suicides,
    not murders.  Soon after Gaudreault left
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Ottawa, the Crown alleged that Stewart began making threatening telephone
    calls to Sylvie Gravelle and to Rhonda Nelson, Gaudreault’s girlfriend, about
    the money and drugs Gaudreault owed him.  Because of Stewart’s threats, Sylvie
    Gravelle sought police protection, pressed Gaudreault for information about
    the
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Cumberland killings, and urged him to go to the police. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gaudreault
    met with police officers in February and March 1990, and gave them some information
    about the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Cumberland murders.  He initially did not tell the police about his role
    in driving the car nor did he implicate Sauvé.  Over time, and once Gaudreault
    was given assurances about witness protection and related payments of money,
    he gradually disclosed his purported involvement and that of Sauvé, Trudel,
    and the appellants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, Gaudreault was cross-examined at length and his credibility was strongly
    attacked.  His cross-examination revealed that he had lied to the police,
    fabricated evidence, and lied at the preliminary inquiry.  He had a lengthy
    criminal record and had continued to commit criminal offences after he went
    to the police and entered the Witness Protection Programme.  Further, in
    January 1990, Gaudreault was using large amounts of drugs and had been using
    cocaine on the day of the killings.  His account of events on the night of
    the murders evolved significantly after he first spoke to the police.  He
    did not name Sauvé as a participant until the lead investigator, Detective
    Heather Lamarche, indicated that she had reason to believe Sauvé was the
    shooter.  The appellants contended that Gaudreault had obtained details of
    the crime from newspaper accounts, including some incorrect facts that found
    their way into the information he provided to the police, but Gaudreault
    denied reading the newspaper accounts and the Crown contended that Gaudreault
    had given them some details not found in the press reports.  The appellants
    also attacked Gaudreault’s credibility on the basis that he had been paid
    substantial sums of money by the police during the course of the investigation
    and shortly before the trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    additional witnesses who testified at trial were central to the Crown’s theory.
    Winn, who was a drug dealer, testified that the appellants confessed to him
    in jail that they had been involved in the murders.
     Smallwood, who was serving time for fraud, wore a recording device in jail
    that captured conversations between him and Stewart mid-way through the trial.  The
    Crown contended that certain statements made by Stewart to Smallwood amounted
    to a confession of his role in the murders.  The appellants contended that
    these statements were intended to be sarcastic.  The trial judge refused
    to leave the jury with other parts of Stewart’s statement to Smallwood in
    which Stewart professed his innocence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence theory was that someone other than the appellants was responsible
    for the crime.  The appellants argued that they did not know the victims,
    did not sell them drugs, and that the victims did not owe them any money.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants argued that because a pregnant woman was murdered, the police
    were particularly motivated to solve the crime quickly.  Their investigation,
    however, was fruitless until they met Gaudreault. Gaudreault became essential
    to the police investigation and they encouraged and rewarded him for his
    information.  The appellants contended that the police did not properly evaluate
    the authenticity of Gaudreault’s story despite his career as a criminal,
    a liar, and the inconsistencies in his story.  The police investigation then
    went about filling the holes in Gaudreault’s narrative and failed to investigate
    other potential suspects.  The attack on the integrity of the police investigation
    provoked the Crown to lead a substantial body of otherwise inadmissible evidence
    about the narrative of how the investigation unfolded.  One key item of evidence
    led in this regard was that Sauvé had been convicted of manslaughter and
    was on parole for this offence when these murders were committed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants argued that Gaudreault, Winn, and Smallwood were unsavoury characters
    whose stories should not be believed.  One of the principal issues on this
    appeal, as in <i>R. v. Sauvé and Trudel</i>, <i>supra</i>, is the adequacy
    of the trial judge’s <i>Vetrovec </i>warning regarding these key witnesses.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mallory
    testified at trial but Stewart did not. Mallory testified that he did not
    know the victims and knew nothing about how they were killed.  He could not
    remember where he was on the night of January 16, 1990, as he was arrested
    almost a year later in December 1990. Mallory denied the truth of Gaudreault’s
    testimony with one exception. Mallory acknowledged that after Gaudreault
    left
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    added a number of additional grounds of appeal directed at obtaining an acquittal.  These
    included the alleged inadequate assistance of counsel at trial, an allegation
    linked to his assertion that a number of lawyers conspired with the police
    and the trial judge to frame him for these crimes.  He also sought to adduce
    as fresh evidence Linda Beland’s post-trial version of what occurred at her
    home on the night of the murders.  The fresh evidence application is addressed
    along with these other issues as a fourteenth ground of appeal.</p>

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></u></h4>
  <h3>1. The adequacy of the Vetrovec caution</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants challenge the adequacy of the trial judge’s <i>Vetrovec</i> caution
    regarding the evidence of Gaudreault, Winn, and Smallwood.  They rely on
    this court’s decision in <i>R. v. Sauvé and Trudel</i>, <i>supra</i>, holding
    that the <i>Vetrovec</i> caution was inadequate.  The appellants submit that
    the facts and circumstances relating to the three unsavoury witnesses in
    this case and the correlative <i>Vetrovec</i> caution was almost exactly
    the same as in <i>R. v. </i><i>Sauvé
    and Trudel</i>, and that accordingly, <i>R. v. </i><i>Sauvé and Trudel</i> must
    apply.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    accept the appellants’ submission that there is no meaningful basis for distinguishing
    this case from <i>R. v. Sauvé and Trudel</i>, <i>supra</i>, on this issue.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R.
      v. Sauvé and Trudel</i>, <i>supra</i>, this court found two fundamental
      flaws in the <i>Vetrovec</i> caution given by the same trial judge regarding
      the evidence of Gaudreault, Jack Trudel, and Scott Emmerson.  The substance
      of Gaudreault’s evidence in the Sauvé and Trudel trial essentially mirrored
      his evidence at this trial. Jack Trudel is the brother of Richard Trudel,
      one of the accused in the related case. Jack Trudel and Emmerson testified
      about statements allegedly made by the accused in that case implicating
      those accused in the murders.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court held in <i>R. v. Sauvé and Trudel</i>, <i>supra</i>, that because of
    the importance of the three unsavoury witnesses and the frailties in their
    evidence, a <i>Vetrovec</i> caution was mandatory.  While recognizing that
    the content of a <i>Vetrovec</i> caution is discretionary, this court concluded,
    at para. 89, that this was “one of those few cases where the trial judge’s
    exercise of discretion was unreasonable” and that the trial judge erred in
    law by: first, failing to explain the reasons for the need for special scrutiny,
    and second, failing to give a sufficiently strong warning about the danger
    of acting on the unconfirmed evidence of the unsavoury witnesses.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    paras. 77 to 80 of its judgment, this court identified three specific reasons
    calling for special scrutiny of the unsavoury witnesses’ evidence that were
    not explained to the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    Emmerson fell within the category of a jailhouse informer (at para. 78):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Informers, especially jailhouse informers, have
    means to obtain information other than from the accused.  The prosecution
    will often take the position that this evidence must have come from the accused
    since the informer had no other means of obtaining it. Informers are resourceful
    and well capable of obtaining information that they later plant into the
    mouth of the accused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    (at para. 78): “it was shown that Gaudreault had lied under oath and had
    actually manufactured evidence in order to bolster his credibility” and that
    the trial judge had to ensure that the jury understood that Gaudreault and
    the other two witnesses “were quite capable of lying and manipulating the
    truth to an astonishing degree, but also present as confident and honest
    before the jury”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    (at para. 80): “Gaudreault presented a special problem because his close
    association with the murders would enable him to provide details of the crime
    and falsely implicate the accused in order to cover up his own involvement” and
    that “it was important that the jury understand that such witnesses can have
    particular motives to lie”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court characterized the<i> </i>strength of caution that was given, at para.
    89, as “simply [instructing] the jury that it may be prudent, where they
    considered it advisable, to look for supporting evidence.”  This court concluded
    that such a warning was not sufficient.  Rather, the case
    “demanded the strongest possible warning”, namely, “a direction that it was
    ‘dangerous’ to act on the unconfirmed evidence of the three principal witnesses.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that as in the Sauvé and Trudel trial, the Crown’s case
    was built around Gaudreault’s evidence.  Further, they contend that Gaudreault’s
    evidence at this trial suffered from all of the same frailties: e.g. use
    of drugs; general difficulties with memory; flashbacks, paranoia, blackouts
    and hallucinations; admitted lies to the police; perjury at the preliminary
    hearing; deals with the police and suggestions that he was testifying for
    money; an extensive criminal history as well as ongoing criminal activity;
    holding back information from the police to use as bargaining ploys; fabrication
    of evidence to bolster his credibility; threats to kill others over drug
    debts; an outstanding debt to Stewart and theft of Stewart’s drugs; inconsistent
    statements; and a concern that that he might be charged with the murders
    depending on what he told the police. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Just
    as in the Sauvé
    and Trudel trial, the Crown relied on the evidence of two unsavoury informers
    with extensive criminal records.  As in the Sauvé and Trudel trial, the two
    informers testified about statements allegedly made by the appellants implicating
    them in the murders.  However, unlike in that trial, all of the statements
    were allegedly made in jail, placing both Winn and Smallwood in the category
    of jailhouse informants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellants submit that the trial judge’s <i>Vetrovec</i> caution in this
    case is essentially identical to the caution he gave in the Sauvé and Trudel
    trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown attempts to distinguish <i>R. v. </i><i>Sauvé and Trudel</i>,<i> supra</i>, both
    on the facts and in terms of the cautions that were given. Relying on <i>R.
    v. Zebedee</i>, [2006] O.J. No. 2628 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), the Crown submits that the <i>Vetrovec</i> caution was adequate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown relies on three main factual differences to distinguish this case from<i> R.
    v. Sauvé and Trudel</i>, <i>supra</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    unlike in <i>R. v. </i><i>Sauvé and Trudel</i>, <i>supra</i>, here one of
    the appellants testified. The Crown contends that Mallory’s evidence regarding
    Stewart’s drug business and Gaudreault’s role in that business provides some
    support for Gaudreault as a truth-teller and therefore diminishes, at least
    to some extent, the level of caution required concerning Gaudreault’s evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    unlike in <i>R. v. </i><i>Sauvé and Trudel</i>, <i>supra</i>, the appellants
    did not challenge Gaudreault’s evidence on the basis that he was an accomplice
    and potential perpetrator.  Rather, the appellants’
    position at trial was simply that Gaudreault was a liar.  The Crown submits
    that an explanation of Gaudreault’s status as an accomplice was not only
    unnecessary, but undesirable in that it may have afforded an element of credibility
    to his evidence that the appellants did not wish him to have. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the Crown submits that Winn and Smallwood do not fall into the same extreme
    category of <i>Vetrovec </i>witnesses as do Emmerson and Jack Trudel and
    that their evidence did not demand the same level of caution.  The Crown
    points out that when Winn came forward in 1993, he was on the reformation
    track and had no criminal convictions since 1989.  Further, at the time of
    trial he was working as a landscaper. Moreover, even though he committed
    a further offence in 1998 a fact that was pointed out to the jury. The Crown
    submits that his crime-free interval places him in a different category than
    Emmerson and Jack Trudel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for Smallwood, the Crown relies on the fact that his conversations with Stewart
    were recorded and that Stewart’s allegedly inculpatory statement was overheard
    by another inmate.  The Crown submits that these factors significantly diminish
    the level of caution required in relation to Smallwood’s evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to these factual distinctions, the Crown submits that there are
    two important differences between the <i>Vetrovec</i> cautions that were
    given in this case and the caution that was given in <i>R. v. Sauvé and Trudel</i>, <i>supra</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first difference is that, unlike <i>R. v. </i><i>Sauvé and Trudel</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    in this case, the trial judge gave a mid-trial instruction immediately following
    the evidence of both Winn and Smallwood.  The essence of the cautionary aspect

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second difference in the instructions relied on by the Crown is the addition
    of two sentences to the <i>Vetrovec </i>caution that was given near the beginning
    of the trial judge’s jury charge.  Before reproducing the actual <i>Vetrovec</i> caution,
    we will first set out a paragraph that introduced it: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Credibility is important in this case.  There are
    witnesses whose criminal records are quite extensive, and whose records do
    not include all their criminal activity.  Some witnesses on both sides have
    admitted to lying under oath whether or not a charge of perjury can be successfully
    laid. Obviously at least three of those witnesses are important to the Crown’s
    case.  They are Denis Gaudreault, Michael Winn and John Smallwood.  In Winn’s
    case he may have had a period of sustained remission since 1989, with one
    hitch in 1998.<b> </b>Gaudreault, too, may be tentatively turning over a
    new leaf, but his case may be more problematic than Mr. Winn’s. But he has
    something he “didn’t have before”, he is working. Smallwood gave his own
    reasons for coming forward to testify.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Vetrovec</i> caution
    given in this case is set out below, and the added sentences are emphasized:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><u>Nevertheless, where witnesses have such unsavoury
      backgrounds, as those particular named witnesses, experience teaches us
      that sometimes justice is perverted by their conduct as witnesses. Sometimes
      they make the blameless seem blameworthy.</u>  Consequently it is prudent
      to examine their evidence carefully, and to look at the evidence of other
      witnesses or exhibits to see if they support the evidence of witnesses
      like Gaudreault, Winn and Smallwood.  It will be for you to determine how
      much supporting evidence you would require to make any particular part
      of their evidence acceptable.  There may well be parts of their evidence
      which you find acceptable as given and not needing any supporting evidence
      because of the way it was given or the common sense supporting such an
      inference.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Of course, you must remember that simply because
    a person is of unsavoury character does not mean that his or her evidence
    must be rejected out of hand without it being adequately considered.  You
    should not turn the unsavoury character caution from me into, as I have said
    before at the trial, an axiom of disbelief.  It is not unusual for witnesses
    of unsavoury character to be called as witnesses when the facts of the case
    require an examination of an illegal business.  Who are the employees of
    an illegal business likely to be? They are often likely to have long criminal
    records and have had other brushes with law enforcement.  As with any witness,
    the jury must dig into each witness’ evidence, and consider it adequately.  As
    part of that consideration it may be prudent for you, where you consider
    it advisable, to look for evidence which tends to support the evidence of
    those three particular witnesses.  The Crown and the defence have referred
    you to the particular parts of the evidence that they think are supportive
    and non-supportive respectively.  The ultimate decision is for you to make.  Remember
    that as jurors you may choose to accept all, part or none of what any witness
    says, whether that witness be unsavoury or not.  The criteria on which you
    base these decisions lie entirely in your hands.  You are the judges of the
    facts. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown submits that the added sentences had two important effects.  First,
    they would have reminded the jury of the evidence at trial concerning the
    unsavoury character of these witnesses and therefore of why caution was required
    in relation to their evidence. Second, they would have signalled to the jury
    the necessary level of caution, i.e. the degree of caution necessary to avoid
    a perversion of justice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    have concluded that there is no meaningful basis for distinguishing this
    case from <i>R. v. Sauvé
    and Trudel</i>, <i>supra</i>, on the issue of the adequacy of the <i>Vetrovec</i> caution
    and that this court’s reasoning in the related case therefore applies.  We
    reach this conclusion for four reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    while it may have been open to the jury to find that Mallory’s evidence provided
    some support for Gaudreault’s credibility, the Crown does not contest that
    Mallory’s evidence related to peripheral matters.  In our view, having regard
    to Gaudreault’s central role in the case and the significant frailties associated
    with his evidence, Mallory’s evidence did not diminish the level of caution
    that was necessary in relation to Gaudreault’s evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    in <i>R. v. Sauvé and Trudel</i>, <i>supra</i>, Gaudreault’s evidence provided
    virtually the entire factual underpinning for the Crown’s case.  The problems
    associated with his evidence went beyond having a significant criminal record
    and being an accomplice to the crime. As this court noted in the related
    case, Gaudreault had lied under oath and fabricated evidence.  Just as in
    the related case, it was therefore essential that the jury understand that
    Gaudreault was “quite capable of lying and manipulating the truth to an astonishing
    degree, but also present as confident and honest before the jury.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, Mallory’s evidence neither diminished the level of caution necessary
    in relation to Gaudreault’s evidence nor obviated the need to explain the
    reasons for the need for scrutiny.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the fact that the appellants in this case did not challenge Gaudreault’s
    evidence on the basis that he was an accomplice does not change the fact
    that based on his own evidence and the Crown’s theory he <i>was</i> an accomplice.  In
    our view, it was Gaudreault’s status as an accomplice, rather than the defence
    position at trial, that created the need for caution in relation to his evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    the defence position at trial could not change the requirement for caution,
    in our view, it did not diminish the trial judge’s obligation to explain
    the reasons why an accomplice’s evidence calls for special scrutiny.  As
    this court explained in <i>R. v. Sauvé and Trudel</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para.
    80, “it was important that the jury understand that such witnesses can have
    particular motives to lie.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Such
    an explanation would no doubt have included a statement that,<i> according
    to the Crown, </i>Gaudreault was an accomplice.  In these circumstances,
    we see no risk to the defence position at trial from giving the necessary
    caution.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    we agree that the level of caution required in relation to Smallwood’s evidence
    should have been attenuated by the fact that his conversations with Stewart
    were recorded.  In our view, however, the ameliorative effect of such a recording
    was diminished by the fact that the jury did not hear allegedly exculpatory
    portions of the conversation and by Smallwood’s denial of the suggestion
    that Stewart also made exculpatory statements, an issue raised as a separate
    ground of appeal and dealt with below.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, even if the level of caution required in relation to Smallwood’s
    evidence was not as high as that required in relation to Emmerson and Jack
    Trudel, we reject the Crown’s submission that Winn’s evidence did not require
    the same level of caution as those two witnesses.  Assuming that Winn was
    actually on a reformation track, the fact remained that he was a long-time
    police informant, that he fell into the category of a jailhouse informer,
    and that he received significant payments from the Witness Protection Programme
    as the result of coming forward with his evidence.  The evidence of such
    a witness demands a high level of caution: see <i>R. v. Sauvé
    and Trudel</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 76, referring to <i>The Commission
    on Proceedings Involving Guy Paul Morin: Report </i>(Toronto: Ontario Ministry
    of the Attorney General, 1998), and <i>Thomas Sophonow Inquiry Report </i>(
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Winnipeg: Manitoba Justice, 2001).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    this court explained in R<i>. v. Sauvé and Trudel</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para.
    81, in relation to all three unsavoury witnesses:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he need for this special care and for informing
    the jury of the reasons for the special care rests on the concern that the
    lay members of the jury simply do not have the necessary experience to adequately
    assess the credibility of these types of witnesses.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    while the mid-trial instructions and the two sentences that were added to
    the trial judge’s jury charge are no doubt of some benefit, they do not address
    the two fundamental problems identified in <i>R. v. Sauvé and Trudel</i>, <i>supra</i>.  In
    particular, they do not explain why an informer’s testimony requires special
    caution nor do they specify problems in Gaudreault’s evidence identified
    by this court in <i>R. v. Sauvé and Trudel</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    since at their core the additional comments remain an instruction “simply … that
    it may be prudent, where [the jury] considered it advisable, to look for
    supporting evidence”, they do not provide a sufficiently strong warning about
    the danger of acting on the unconfirmed evidence of the unsavoury witnesses. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, as in <i>R. v. Sauvé and Trudel</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 210,
    even though these witnesses were cross-examined about the numerous frailties
    in their evidence over many days (Gaudreault for over approximately 15 days,
    Smallwood 5 days, and Winn 3 days) and the jury heard various submissions
    as to why they should not be believed, given their central role in the case
    and the frailties in their evidence, something was missing, namely:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…a clear and explicit direction from the trial
    judge that as a matter of law it was dangerous to act on their evidence and
    an expression from the trial judge, not defence counsel as to why it was
    dangerous in this particular case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the <i>Vetrovec</i> caution given in this case suffered from the
    same legal errors as the caution given in <i>R. v. Sauvé
    and Trudel</i>, <i>supra</i>. Accordingly, we would give effect to this ground
    of appeal.</p>
  <h3>2. The admissibility of narrative evidence relating to the police investigation</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the trial judge erred by admitting a considerable
    volume of evidence led by the Crown in relation to the police investigation.  In
    order to deal with this submission, it is necessary to consider how the issue
    of the integrity of the police investigation unfolded over the course of
    the trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants brought various pre-trial motions. One of the most significant
    was the abuse of process motion, an omnibus attack on the prosecution that,
    among other things, attacked the integrity of the police investigation.  The
    trial judge dismissed this motion: see <i>R. v. Mallory</i>, [2000] O.J.
    No. 954 (S.C.J.). The investigation had also been attacked in <i>R. v.</i> <i>Sauvé and
    Trudel</i>, <i>supra</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the Crown’s opening, the Crown anticipated an attack on the integrity of
    the investigation by the defence.  The Crown described how the investigation
    “belonged” to Detectives Lamarche and Riddell, but that more officers were
    added in 1993.  The Crown introduced Lamarche, mentioned that she would testify
    after Gaudreault, and explained her role in the Crown’s case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence
    counsel applied for a mistrial immediately after the Crown’s opening address,
    largely on the basis that the Crown had inappropriately and unfairly characterized
    the appellants’ position, but asked for an adjournment and an opportunity
    to argue the motion with a full transcript of the Crown’s opening.  The trial
    judge refused to delay the trial while the transcript of the Crown’s opening
    address was being prepared and ruled that defence counsel could renew the
    motion when the transcript became available, but gave that the defence the
    option of making an opening address to the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for Stewart elected to open to the jury.  She responded to the Crown’s characterization
    of the defence position by arguing that Lamarche was relatively inexperienced
    yet very motivated to solve this high profile crime.  Counsel for Mallory
    elected not to present an opening argument.  The application for a mistrial
    was later renewed when the transcript became available but was dismissed
    by the trial judge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lamarche,
    the lead investigator, was called by the Crown immediately after Gaudreault
    testified.  During Lamarche’s examination-in-chief, cross-examination, and
    re-examination, there were many objections, submissions, and rulings as to
    the extent to which the parties were entitled to probe the police investigation.  The
    Crown sought to bolster the investigation and managed to adduce a considerable
    body of highly prejudicial hearsay evidence.  The defence sought to undermine
    the investigation and thereby provided the Crown with some justification
    for leading this contentious body of evidence. What follows is but a brief
    summary of how this unfolded. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    Lamarche took the stand, there had been no defence application to lead evidence
    of “other suspects” nor had there been any application, <i>voir dire</i>,
    or ruling with respect to the parameters of Lamarche’s evidence as to the
    course of the investigation. Crown counsel proceeded to lead evidence, much
    of it hearsay, over the objection of the defence, to establish the integrity
    of the investigation, to elucidate Lamarche’s state of mind as the investigation
    progressed, and to corroborate Gaudreault’s testimony.  The Crown argued
    that Stewart’s counsel had attacked Lamarche in her opening address and that
    Lamarche was entitled to defend herself.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mallory’s
    counsel sought to distance his client from any attack on the integrity of
    the investigation and submitted that none of Lamarche’s testimony was admissible
    against his client.  Counsel for Mallory conducted a brief cross-examination
    of Lamarche that did not focus on her state of mind.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for Stewart asked Lamarche many questions about the investigation during
    a lengthy cross-examination.  Counsel for Stewart then asked for permission
    to cross-examine Lamarche about other suspects and the alleged failure to
    explore other potential leads on the theory that the police blindly relied
    on Gaudreault and ignored other potential suspects.  The Crown vigorously
    objected to questions focusing on other potential suspects.  The trial judge
    held that defence counsel could pursue this issue if it went to the “state
    of mind of Detective Lamarche at that stage of the investigation, and the
    steps she was taking in the investigation against the backdrop of all the
    information she was receiving about the case at that time”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    an unusually lengthy re-examination that extended over several days, the
    Crown was permitted to lead a significant body of
    “investigative hearsay” evidence to explain the conduct of the investigation
    in response to the “other suspects” theory advanced by Stewart.  Much of
    this evidence was highly prejudicial to the appellants.  It included Sauvé’s
    previous manslaughter conviction, evidence that Sauvé and Trudel had “spoken”
    (confessed) to various individuals not called by the Crown, and otherwise
    inadmissible evidence that police intelligence dating from June 1990 suggested
    that the Vanasse organization was responsible for a number of murders in
    the
    <st1:place

    Ottawa area.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    re-examination, counsel for the appellants asked for permission to re-cross-examine
    Lamarche but the trial judge refused to allow them the opportunity.  The
    trial judge also dismissed a mistrial application after the completion of
    Lamarche’s evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge provided limiting instructions about the admissibility and limited
    use of hearsay evidence during Lamarche’s evidence in-chief, in cross-examination,
    and in re-examination.  In his charge to the jury, the trial judge repeated
    his instruction as to the limited use of hearsay evidence.  However, some
    of the hearsay evidence led through Lamarche found its way into the trial
    judge’s summary of the evidence without any accompanying instruction as to
    its permitted use.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    manner in which the issue of hearsay evidence led in relation to the investigation
    was managed in this case was problematic from a number of perspectives. No
    doubt, the defence strategy invited much of this evidence.  However, there
    was some highly prejudicial evidence, admitted under the guise of a response
    to the attack on the investigation, which should have been kept from the
    jury. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN style='color:black;'>As </span>we
    have concluded that the convictions must be set aside and a new trial ordered
    on the basis of numerous other grounds of appeal, we do not consider it necessary
    to consider that body of evidence in detail.  We propose to offer a number
    of observations on the issue of investigative hearsay and to deal with one
    particularly problematic piece of evidence, namely, the evidence of Sauvé’s
    manslaughter conviction that is raised as a separate issue, below. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately,
    the parties and the trial judge did not have the benefit of this court’s
    judgment in <i>R. v. Dhillon </i>(2002), 166 C.C.C. (3d) 262 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), which considered the issue of investigative hearsay.  At para. 51 of their
    reasons, Laskin and Goudge JJ.A. offered the following “<span class=loose1><span lang=EN style='color:black;'>general
    observations about investigative hearsay evidence led to address a defence
    contention of an inadequate police investigation”:</span></span><span class=loose1><span
lang=EN style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black;'> </span></span><span lang=EN> </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN style='color:black;'>(a)        The risks of an accused advancing
      this kind of defence are all too apparent. </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN style='color:black;'>(b)       If an accused intends to claim
      that a police investigation was inadequate, it may well be safest for the
      trial judge to conduct a full <i>voir dire</i> before ruling.  In a <i>voir
      dire</i>, the trial judge can more precisely balance the probative value
      and prejudicial effect of the proposed evidence and need not rely on counsel’s
      broad representations about the evidence.  Moreover, the accused’s decision
      about whether to pursue this line of questioning can then be made with
      fuller information about its potential impact. </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN style='color:black;'>(c) If the defence seeks to cast doubt
      on the adequacy of the investigation of other possible suspects, in principle
      we see no reason why the Crown is necessarily precluded from leading evidence
      about the police investigation of the accused, provided that evidence is
      relevant to the adequacy of the investigation.  With limited resources,
      police decisions about investigating other suspects may well depend on
      their knowledge of the accused and his activities. </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN style='color:black;'>(d) If evidence of the police investigation
      is admissible and is pursued, its limited use must be made clear to the
      jury. See <i>R. v. Starr</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 144, 147 C.C.C. (3d) 449
      at para. 184.  In the course of instructing the jury on the permissible
      uses of this evidence, the trial judge would be wise to highlight specifically
      those parts of the investigation that would otherwise be inadmissible as
      either hearsay or police opinion.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the decision by an accused to attack the integrity of the investigation is
    a permitted but risky strategy.  The risk is that the accused will make relevant
    and admissible evidence that the Crown could not ordinarily lead.  In this
    case, a considerable volume of what would otherwise have been inadmissible
    hearsay relating to the decisions made by the investigative team and the
    progress of the investigation became admissible because of the defence strategy.  The
    problem escalated when, during Lamarche’s cross-examination, the defence
    introduced the “other suspects” issue over the Crown’s objection.  The trial
    judge made a ruling permitting the appellants to cross-examine Lamarche on
    that issue and that ruling was not challenged on this appeal.  Accordingly,
    like the court in <i>R. v. Dhillon</i>,<i> supra</i>, at para. 46, we conclude
    that this is not the proper case to decide “when, if ever, the defence should
    be permitted to introduce investigative hearsay evidence to support an allegation
    that the police investigation of other leads was inadequate” and we should
    not be taken as endorsing the trial judge’s ruling in this case. We observe,
    however, that by raising the “other suspects” issue, the defence invited
    a response that included damaging hearsay evidence, much of it led in reply,
    as to what the police did and why they did it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the history of this case demonstrates the wisdom of confronting the issue
    as early as possible in the trial, whether following a <i>voir dire</i> or
    otherwise, to obtain a clear ruling to define the parameters and limits on
    this type of evidence and to ensure that the evidence will be led in an orderly
    manner that is fair to both sides. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    problem began when the Crown introduced the issue in its opening and then
    in direct examination of Lamarche in an attempt to bolster Gaudreault as
    a witness.  The issue of the integrity of the investigation was one for the
    defence to raise, not for the Crown to anticipate.  Unless and until the
    defence introduced the issue, the Crown should have avoided it.  A defence
    attack on the investigation may well have appeared inevitable, but in our
    view the Crown should have left the issue alone and done nothing that could
    be seen as forcing the defence’s hand.  We deal below with other problematic
    aspects of the Crown’s opening which have at their core the same common element:
    rather than present an outline of the case it intended to lead, the Crown
    used the opening to argue the case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    certainly do not say that the unsatisfactory manner in which this issue unfolded
    was entirely attributable to the Crown.  The defence attacked the investigation
    and that attack invited a response.  The defence’s introduction of the “other
    suspects” issue mid-way through Lamarche’s cross-examination had a cascading
    impact resulting in Lamarche testifying over several days in re-examination.  This
    produced the unfortunate result of the Crown leading a highly contentious
    body of damaging hearsay evidence in circumstances offering the defence little
    or no chance to challenge it.  Clearly, it would have been preferable had
    the entire issue been confronted at the outset to enable the trial judge
    to fashion a ruling that would permit the fair and orderly presentation of
    any proper evidence relating to the integrity of the investigation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    there are limits to the evidence the Crown can lead in response to a defence
    attack on the integrity of the investigation.  The Crown’s evidence must
    be relevant to the attack: see <i>R. v. </i><i>Dhillon</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    and the discussion of the Sauvé
    manslaughter conviction, below.  The trial judge must <span lang=EN style='color:black;
'>precisely balance the probative value and prejudicial effect of the proposed
    evidence.  In our view, the evidence led through Lamarche of information
    received from unnamed confidential informants the Crown did not call implying
    that Sauvé and Trudel had confessed to the crime was obviously suspect on
    that score.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN style='color:black;'>Fourth,
      as stated in <i>R. v. </i><i>Dhillon</i>, <i>supra</i>, a careful instruction
      to the jury as to the limited permissible use of the hearsay evidence is
      required.  As we have already indicated, the trial judge did provide a
      general limiting instruction, but unfortunately, when it came to summarizing
      the evidence, he included some elements of the investigative hearsay evidence.  It
      would be asking too much to expect the jury to apply the general instruction,
      especially as the trial judge himself appears to have overlooked the hearsay
      quality of this evidence.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    conclude our analysis of the investigative hearsay by considering the wrongful
    admission of Sauvé’s manslaughter conviction, raised as the next discrete
    ground of appeal. </p>
  <h3>3. The admissibility of Sauvé’s manslaughter conviction</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    of the most damaging aspects of the “investigative hearsay” the Crown led
    on the re-examination of Lamarche was evidence that Sauvé had a prior conviction
    for manslaughter.  Lamarche testified that Sauvé had brutally killed a cab
    driver with a gun, had been charged with murder but convicted of manslaughter,
    and that he was on parole for that offence at the time of the Giroux and
    Bourdeau murders.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    central feature of the defence was that Gaudreault had used information obtained
    from other sources to fabricate his evidence.  Gaudreault did not name Sauvé as
    a participant until Lamarche told him in a telephone conversation in May
    1990 that she had information from the RCMP that an informant had identified
    Sauvé as the shooter and had also warned Gaudreault that as a witness in
    the case he was at risk. Gaudreault immediately added Sauvé to the list of
    those he said were involved in the murders. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for Stewart challenged Lamarche on cross-examination as to why she had risked
    tainting Gaudreault’s evidence by giving him Sauvé’s name as a likely participant.
    Counsel for Stewart sought to use the fact that Gaudreault only identified
    Sauvé as a participant after Lamarche had told him she suspected that Sauvé was
    involved as further indication that Gaudreault’s story was based on information
    he had gleaned from other sources.  Counsel did not impugn the basis for
    Lamarche’s belief that Sauvé was a participant but attacked her methodology
    in revealing her suspicion to Gaudreault and thereby providing him with a
    further detail he could use to bolster his story.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge ruled that the Crown should be permitted to lead evidence in
    re-examination of Sauvé’s manslaughter conviction on the basis that the evidence
    was “probative of Detective Lamarche’s state of mind, and why she told Gaudreault
    of his need to be careful as a witness in these proceedings, and why she
    thought the RCMP informant would name Sauvé as the shooter.”  The trial judge
    recognized the potential prejudice of the jury improperly using the conviction
    as propensity reasoning as to Sauvé’s involvement and then finding the appellants
    guilty by association.  He ruled, however, that “the introduction of Sauvé’s
    record … by Detective Lamarche is more probative for her investigative state
    of mind at the time of the important phone call of May 9, 1990 than it is
    prejudicial to these accused” and that a limiting instruction could alleviate
    any prejudice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the trial judge erred in permitting the Crown to lead the evidence
    of Sauvé’s manslaughter conviction.  This evidence was not relevant to or
    probative of the issue the defence had raised on cross-examination as to
    the investigative method used by Lamarche in relation to Gaudreault.  That
    attack did not put in issue the reasonableness of Lamarche’s belief that
    Sauvé was involved in the murders.  As this court held in <i>R. v. </i><i>Dhillon</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    the Crown is entitled to lead evidence as to the investigation of the accused,
    but only where the evidence is relevant to and probative of the adequacy
    of the investigation.  The reasonableness of Lamarche’s belief that Sauvé was
    the shooter had nothing to do with the point upon which the investigation
    was attacked, namely, that she had tainted the reliability of Gaudreault’s
    story by feeding him an important fact that he did not come up with on his
    own.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge gave a mid-trial limiting instruction that the evidence led on
    Lamarche’s re-examination was not led for the truth of its contents but only
    as evidence of her state of mind which the jury could consider when assessing
    whether her conduct of the investigation was reasonable.  The trial judge,
    however, did not warn the jury against using the conviction as evidence of
    propensity nor did he provide any instruction in relation to the Sauvé conviction
    in his final instructions to the jury.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    risk that evidence of the conviction might have been improperly used by the
    jury was significantly enhanced by the Crown’s closing address.  The Crown
    argued that Sauvé “was brought along on that day to do the killing because
    [he] had the particular skill set that the job required.”  She told the jury
    that the car used on the night of the murders “could be traced back to the
    parolee James Sauvé”; she referred to Sauvé’s “prior experience” and stated “the
    ideal place to go with James Sauvé is to an execution.” Sauvé was labelled
    a “mad dog”, “a wacko and a dangerous guy, a killer in fact”.  We can only
    read these comments in the Crown’s closing address as referring to Sauvé’s
    record as a convicted killer and as inviting the jury to engage in impermissible
    propensity reasoning.  In our view, the trial judge erred by failing to provide
    any corrective or limiting instruction. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown submits that there is no categorical exclusion of propensity evidence
    and cites the permitted use of such evidence to support certain defences.  The
    Crown argues that as the propensity evidence relates to Sauvé, not the appellants,
    it was properly admitted.  We disagree for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the trial judge did not make a finding that the evidence was admissible on
    that basis and indeed seems to have assumed that it could not be used for
    that purpose. Moreover, the Crown did not advance this argument when seeking
    to have this evidence admitted at trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    we agree with the appellants that Gaudreault’s evidence and the Crown’s theory
    had an “all or nothing” quality and that there was a serious risk that the
    jury could use the evidence of Sauvé’s propensity for homicidal violence
    as support for Gaudreault’s evidence and thereby implicate the appellants.  Sauvé’s
    manslaughter conviction was also admitted by the trial judge in <i>R. v.
    Sauvé and Trudel</i>, <i>supra</i>.
     This court found that the trial judge had erred in that case by admitting
    evidence of Sauvé’s conviction.  While the evidence was tendered on a different
    basis in that case, this court’s assessment that it was “extremely prejudicial”
    is apposite here given the Crown’s theory. If the Crown could not use this
    evidence directly against Sauvé to show he did the killing, we fail to see
    how the Crown should be able to use the same evidence to convict the appellants
    by indirectly implicating Sauvé.  On the Crown’s theory, this was a common
    enterprise with a common purpose and the Crown’s case for Mallory and Stewart
    was proved essentially by the same evidence.  The evidence could not be used
    against Sauvé and Trudel and it should not have been used against the appellants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    conclude that the trial judge erred by permitting the Crown to lead evidence
    of Sauvé’s manslaughter conviction. Even if, contrary to our analysis, that
    evidence was admissible for the limited purpose of assessing Lamarche’s state
    of mind when conducting the investigation, the trial judge failed to give
    the jury an adequate instruction to that effect. Such an instruction was
    required, especially after Crown counsel transparently invited the jury to
    engage in propensity reasoning in her closing address. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we would give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h3>4.   The limitation imposed by the trial judge on the cross-examination
    of Gaudreault relating to the newspaper articles</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the trial judge erred by limiting the cross-examination
    of Gaudreault on the newspaper articles that the appellants contend served
    as the source for his story to the police and for his testimony at trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge ruled that counsel for Stewart could ask Gaudreault whether he
    had based his information upon newspaper accounts and, if he answered affirmatively,
    show him the articles allegedly used as the source.  However, if Gaudreault
    denied reading any articles and denied that they were his source, the trial
    judge ruled that counsel was not entitled to confront Gaudreault with a series
    of articles that he said he had never seen. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gaudreault
    denied basing his story on newspaper articles and flatly denied that he had
    read any articles concerning the case other than the one he claimed Stewart
    had brandished when he came to Gaudreault’s house shortly after the murders.
    At trial, he was shown one article and denied having read it or any others.  As
    a result of the trial judge’s ruling and Gaudreault’s denial, counsel for
    Stewart was precluded from her intended course of confronting Gaudreault
    with all the various accounts of the case that appeared in the press and
    that the defence asserted had supplied Gaudreault with his information.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later
    in the trial, the defence adduced the articles in evidence and, on the basis
    of the contents of those articles, the defence submitted to the jury that
    the articles contained almost all of the information Gaudreault needed to
    concoct his story.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    certainly would have been possible – and perhaps even preferable – to have
    afforded counsel a bit more latitude given the importance of this issue to
    the defence. Although Gaudreault denied reading the articles, there was something
    to be said for allowing the defence to confront him with more than just one
    of the articles to test his story and to allow the jury to assess his response
    to the defence’s contention.  However, the articles in question were later
    admitted in evidence and the defence was able to compare Gaudreault’s story
    with the articles and to make the argument that he had used them as his source.
     We are not persuaded that the appellants suffered any material prejudice
    as a result of the trial judge’s ruling.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    trial judge does have discretion to curtail a prolonged and repetitive cross-examination
    that will only produce a string of repeated denials:  see <i>R. v. Proverbs </i>(1983),
    9 C.C.C. (3d) 249 at 262 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ); <i>R. v. McIntosh </i>(1999), 141 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at paras. <span lang=FR-CA>80-84
    (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. Dunn </i>(1993), 82 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.).  </span>In
    our view, while it would have been preferable to have given defence counsel
    more latitude, the trial judge did not exceed the limits of his discretion
    by limiting what was bound to be a repetitive and unproductive cross-examination
    on newspaper articles Gaudreault insisted he had never seen.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h3>5.      The admissibility of certain statements made by Mallory upon his
    arrest</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mallory
    was arrested for the two murders at a residence in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ottawa on December 21, 1990 by Ottawa Police Officers Ian Davidson and Karl
    Erfle.  Davidson had once worked a beat in the same area where Mallory was
    employed as a bouncer and the two men recognized each other immediately.  After
    Davidson cautioned Mallory and advised him of his s. 10(b) <i>Charter</i> rights,
    Mallory indicated he did not wish to contact counsel at that time but would
    do so at the police station if Davidson would tell him how he could reach
    a lawyer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>En
    route to the police station, Davidson began a conversation with Mallory about
    Mallory’s interest in arm wrestling.  Davidson then asked Mallory if he knew
    what the arrest was all about. Mallory replied that he had read about the
    murder of a man and woman in the newspaper, and that he had never heard of “these
    people.”  Davidson asked if Mallory had seen the names of the other people
    arrested.  Mallory replied that he had, but added that he did not know any
    of them.  After a pause, he said he just saw his name in the newspaper.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Within
    minutes of his arrival at the police station, Mallory was taken to a private
    room and given an opportunity to contact counsel.  Once he had spoken to
    a lawyer, Mallory was taken to an interview room where he again advised Davidson
    that he had read about the reason for his arrest and seen a picture of the
    man and the woman who were killed in the newspaper.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mallory’s
    statements made en route to the police station were significant because of
    his claim that he did not know the other individuals who had been arrested
    in connection with the murders.  In a ruling concerning the admissibility
    of these statements, the trial judge found that at the time of Mallory’s
    arrest, Davidson knew very little about the case beyond the existence of
    a Canada-wide warrant and that his questions “were in the vein of ‘what’s
    this all about.’”
    The trial judge described Mallory and Davidson as “acquaintances of some
    years standing” and said he was “unable to characterize Sgt. Davidson’s quasi-bantering
    conversation with Mr. Mallory as a ‘wilful and deliberate’ or
    ‘open and flagrant disregard’ of his constitutional rights”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless,
    given that Mallory had expressed a desire to contact counsel, the trial judge
    held that Davidson violated Mallory’s s. 10(b) <i>Charter</i> rights by failing
    to hold off in questioning him during the 12 minutes it took to transport
    him to the police station. The trial judge noted that a call to counsel could
    not have been made in privacy at the residence and “wait[ing] 12 minutes
    until the privacy of an interview room …
    was available was the way to allow Mr. Mallory to ‘retain and instruct counsel
    without delay.’”  The trial judge also said: “[I]t is apparent that Sgt.
    Davidson felt he had the right to continue to question an accused once he
    had given the right to counsel and the right to silence.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge went on to find that Mallory’s statements should not be excluded
    under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>. In doing so, he classified the evidence
    of the statements as non-conscriptive and said he was unable to see how its
    admission would affect the fairness of the trial.  He said there was no air
    of trickery on the part of the officers, that Mallory had a choice to remain
    silent but chose to speak, and that the interference with Mallory’s constitutional
    rights was minimal.  The trial judge concluded that “refusal to admit this
    evidence would bring the administration of justice into greater disrepute
    than its admission, particularly since the officers’ actions were completely
    non-compulsive.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the trial judge erred in law in his analysis of this
    issue in two respects and that several of his findings of fact are flawed
    as a result. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the appellants submit that in holding that Mallory <i>chose</i> to speak
    to the police at a time when he had not had the opportunity of consulting
    with counsel, the trial judge misconstrued Mallory’s conduct as amounting
    to a waiver of the right to silence. This, in turn, led the trial judge to
    misunderstand the scope of the <i>Charter</i> violation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellants say that the trial judge erred in finding that Mallory’s post-arrest
    statements were non-conscriptive.  While acknowledging that in the light
    of <i>R. v. Elias</i>; <i>R. v. Orbanski</i> (2005), 196 C.C.C. (3d) 481
    (S.C.C.) and <i>R. v. Grant</i> (2006), 209 C.C.C. (3d) 250 (Ont. C.A.),
    a finding that the statements were conscriptive would not lead automatically
    to their exclusion, the appellants submit that the trial judge’s erroneous
    finding tainted much of his s. 24(2) <i>Charter</i> analysis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, the Crown concedes that Mallory’s s. 10(b) <i>Charter</i> rights
    were violated, that the trial judge erred in holding that Mallory’s statements
    were non-conscriptive, and that the trial judge’s conclusion on this issue
    attracts no deference as a result.  However, the Crown argues that the trial
    judge’s findings indicating that the s. 10(b) <i>Charter</i> breach was of
    a minor and technical nature remain important and that, based on those findings,
    his conclusion that the statements should be admitted is correct. In the
    alternative, the Crown argues that the admission of this evidence occasioned
    no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the submissions of both parties that based on the record before
    him, the trial judge was correct in holding that Mallory’s s. 10(b) <i>Charter </i>rights
    were violated but that he erred in finding that Mallory’s statements were
    non-conscriptive.  In particular, since Mallory’s statements were the product
    of questions from a police officer rather than being spontaneous, it is clear
    that they amounted to conscriptive evidence.  However, as we have decided
    that it is necessary that we order a new trial based on our conclusions on
    other grounds of appeal, in our view, the issue of a fresh s. 24(2) <i>Charter</i> analysis
    is best left to be assessed based on the record at the new trial.</p>

      ruling in which he had edited a Crown surveillance videotape by deleting
      those portions in which Stewart talked about his six-year-old son firing
      machine guns and purchasing gun magazines.  Based on the revised ruling,
      the Crown cross-examined Mallory on the contents of the videotape and a
      surveillance audiotape containing similar material.</span></p>

      Crown to recall Detective Inspector Glenn Miller to give reply evidence
      in three areas: i) to authenticate the content of the surveillance videotape
      and audiotape; ii) to indicate that Stewart did not limit the information
      about his guns that he shared with Miller while Miller was operating undercover
      as a drug purchaser on “a need-to-know basis”; and iii) to provide opinion
      evidence concerning the likelihood that a drug organization such as Stewart’s
      would have a “no guns” policy.</span></p>

lang=EN-GB style='letter-spacing:-.15pt;'>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    part of its case, the Crown called Miller to testify concerning his experiences
    in infiltrating the Stewart drug organization between July and December 1990.  In
    addition to giving evidence of his observations, Miller was qualified to
    give expert evidence concerning <span
lang=EN-GB style='letter-spacing:-.15pt;'>importing and trafficking hashish and
    cocaine and concerning the security measures and operations of a drug organization
    carrying on these activities.  In his evidence, Miller referred to conversations
    he had with Stewart about security and the use of guns within the drug organization. </span></p>

lang=EN-GB>[128]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>For example, Miller testified that Stewart spoke about the practice
      of having packers (armed guards) accompany couriers delivering larger quantities
      of drugs.  In addition, Miller referred to a specific conversation in which
      Gaudreault and Stewart discussed a .223 gun Stewart had, the capacity of
      the bullets from that gun to penetrate a vest, alterations to the gun permitting
      it to operate as a machine gun and the fact that someone had a number of
      guns in a well.  Finally, Miller said that Stewart spoke of having an explosive
      device and about an occasion on which he picked up 65 sticks of dynamite.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>  In addition to Miller’s evidence, as part of its case, the Crown
      tendered wiretap evidence and surreptitiously-obtained audiotape and videotape
      evidence relating to the Stewart drug organization.  Following Miller’s
      evidence, the trial judge made a ruling editing a videotape of a meeting
      held on October 16, 1990 between Miller, Stewart and Gaudreault.  Conversation
      at the meeting included discussions about the use of guns.  The trial judge
      excluded Stewart’s references to his six-year-old son firing machine guns
      and purchasing gun magazines, holding that such evidence was more prejudicial
      than probative. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[130]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>As a result of the trial judge’s ruling, the Crown did not tender
      as part of its case the October 16, 1990 videotape or an audiotape of a
      December 6, 1990 meeting that included similar discussions. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    Mallory’s cross-examination, the Crown asked the trial judge to make a finding
    that Mallory put his character in issue by giving evidence to the effect
    that, with Stewart, his role as a debt collector did not extend to breaking
    limbs and that it never involved weapons.  The trial judge held that Mallory
    had not put his character in issue through this evidence.  In the course
    of his ruling, he characterized Mallory’s evidence as saying that “guns were
    not a policy option available to Mr. Mallory.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later
    in Mallory’s cross-examination, the Crown asked the trial judge to revisit
    his ruling editing the videotape of the October 16, 1990 meeting based on
    what the Crown described as a “changed landscape”, namely that it was misleading
    for Mallory to be testifying that guns were “not Stewart’s way”.  In making
    this request, the Crown relied on an extract of Mallory’s examination-in-chief,
    in which Mallory said Stewart would never let him have a gun because “that
    wasn’t his way”.  The Crown characterized this evidence as describing a “no
    guns” policy within the organization.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[133]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the Crown also relied more generally on the fact that Mallory essentially
    disavowed hearing Stewart speak about guns, claiming that he received information
    about the organization on “a need-to-know basis.”  While some such testimony
    had arisen in examination-in-chief (e.g. Mallory testified in-chief that
    the only gun he remembered hearing about was a .223, but that at the time
    he did not know what a .223 was), the Crown also relied on Mallory’s cross-examination. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[134]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    example, in cross-examination, Mallory claimed that, other than “hearing
    about a .223 or something”, he never heard Stewart brag about any weapons.  In
    contrast to Declare’s evidence, he said he had never heard Stewart refer
    to guns as toys and he agreed with a suggestion that that was because Stewart
    did not have any guns. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[135]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    Miller’s evidence of what he heard about Stewart’s .223 was put to Mallory,
    he agreed that Stewart told him he had a .223 and explained that since he
    had never heard of a car called a .223, it had to be a gun.  However, he
    denied Stewart ever told him that bullets from the gun could penetrate a
    police vest, that the gun had been altered to be a machine gun, that he [Stewart]
    had grenades, or that he had about 65 sticks of dynamite.  As a general response
    to his knowledge of these matters, he said: “A need-to-know basis. Why would
    he mention it to me.  I never had a gun”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[136]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    responding to the Crown’s submissions, counsel for both Mallory and Stewart
    submitted that Mallory’s evidence did not extend to asserting there was a “no
    guns” policy within the organization.  According to them, Mallory was saying
    no more than that Stewart would not let <i>him</i> have a gun.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[137]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence
    counsel also relied on the fact that the October 16, 1990 surveillance videotape
    included a statement by Stewart that while he wanted Mallory to slap people
    around he did not want him using a gun because “[t]he day Rick walks in with
    a gun is the day somebody’s gonna kill him.”  Based on this evidence, defence
    counsel asserted there was nothing inconsistent between the videotape and
    Mallory’s evidence at trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[138]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    colloquy, the trial judge stated that his understanding of the Crown’s position
    was not that there was a contradiction between Stewart’s statement on the
    video that Mallory should not use a gun and Mallory’s evidence at trial,
    but rather “that the policy, no matter when enunciated, was always nonsense,
    never was valid … and [was] totally unrelated to reality, no matter what
    they told Miller”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[139]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    in reasons for reversing his prior ruling relating to the surveillance tape,
    the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Both the lack of guns in Mr. Stewart’s hands or
    in the hands of surrogates, and the
    “no guns policy” for Mr. Mallory have emerged as centrepieces of the defences,
    in effect of both men.  The primary reason for now allowing the evidence
    of Mr. Stewart’s trips to the firing range with his son is to show his interest
    in guns and the interest and pride he took in his son’s accomplishments at
    an early age…The evidence merely tends to try to establish that Mr. Mallory’s “no
    guns policy” as dictated by Mr. Stewart does not emanate from a “hands-off
    guns” policy adhered to by Mr. Stewart.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[140]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted, following completion of Mallory’s evidence, the trial judge permitted
    the Crown to recall Miller to give reply evidence in the three areas we have
    identified.  In doing so, the trial judge expressed an expectation that the
    re-examination would be focussed and the evidence given in short compass.  The
    reply evidence that was led in-chief spans approximately seven pages of transcript.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[141]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the basis for the trial judge’s decision to reverse
    his prior ruling concerning the surveillance tapes and to admit Miller’s
    reply evidence was his conclusion that Mallory testified that Stewart’s drug
    organization had a “no guns” policy.  They say that, contrary to this conclusion,
    the essence of Mallory’s testimony was that Stewart did not allow <i>him</i> to
    carry a gun.  Moreover, the appellants submit that the position of the Crown
    that without the benefit of the surveillance tapes and the reply evidence
    the jury might be left with the impression that the drug organization operated
    weapons free was unrealistic and untenable.  The appellants claim that the
    prejudice in allowing the further gun evidence far outweighed its probative
    value.  Moreover, they claim that the trial judge’s decision to permit the
    reply evidence violated the collateral evidence rule and improperly allowed
    the Crown to split its case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[142]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not accept the appellants’ submissions.  In our view, in addition to Mallory’s
    statement in-chief “that wasn’t [Stewart’s] way”, the important features
    of Mallory’s evidence that led to the trial judge’s rulings permitting cross-examination
    on the surveillance tape and the reply evidence were Mallory’s disavowal
    of any knowledge of Stewart’s involvement with guns and his claim that he
    received information on “a need- to-know” basis.  While Mallory may not have
    testified directly that there was a “no guns” policy within the Stewart drug
    organization, on the whole of the record before him, it was open to the trial
    judge to interpret Mallory’s testimony as amounting to evidence that the
    Stewart drug organization had a “no guns” policy. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[143]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the appellants have not demonstrated any error in the trial judge’s
    conclusion that “the lack of guns in Mr. Stewart’s hands … and the ‘no guns
    policy’ for Mr. Mallory <u>ha[d] emerged</u> as centrepieces of the [defence]”.
    [Emphasis added.]  In these circumstances, it was open to the trial judge
    to reverse his prior ruling relating to cross-examination on the surveillance
    tape. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[144]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    while the Crown should have anticipated the possibility that Mallory would
    testify that Stewart would not permit <i>him</i> to use a gun based on Stewart’s
    comment to that effect on the surveillance tape, this reference did not raise
    the possibility that Mallory would make the statement “that wasn’t [Stewart’s]
    way”, disavow knowledge of Stewart’s involvement with guns, or say that he
    received information on a “need-to-know”
    basis.  In our view, the trial judge might well have concluded that Miller’s
    original evidence was sufficient to respond to these claims and we consider
    that this would have been a preferable result.  Nevertheless, given the trial
    judge’s finding that Mallory’s evidence concerning a “no guns” policy “had
    emerged as a centrepiece of the defence”, in all of the circumstances, we
    are not persuaded that the trial judge erred in holding that Mallory’s evidence
    opened the door to a more direct response through focussed and limited reply
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[145]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-GB>Neither
      party made extensive submissions concerning the reply evidence led to authenticate
      the surveillance videotape and audiotape.  It appears that, save for a
      portion of one of the tapes, the defence offered to admit their authenticity
      but that issue was never resolved and, in any event, the defence conceded
      that the Crown was not obliged to accept their admission.  In the circumstances,
      we consider it unnecessary that we formally determine whether this portion
      of the reply evidence was proper. We would, however, observe that since
      the audiotape and videotape were played during cross-examination, it was
      unnecessary that they be replayed in reply.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[146]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We

  <h3>7.      The admissibility of reply evidence regarding the circumstances
    of Mallory’s arrest</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[147]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for Mallory submits that the trial judge erred by permitting the Crown to
    lead reply evidence that, contrary to Mallory’s assertion that he was preparing
    to surrender himself once he learned that he was wanted by the police, he
    was in fact evading the police at the time of his arrest.  Mallory takes
    particular exception to Davidson’s hearsay evidence given in reply that Mallory
    had admitted to his girlfriend that he had a role in the murders. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[148]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the submission that on a fair reading of the evidence Mallory
    had effectively admitted in cross-examination that at the moment of his arrest,
    he was evading the police “to put his affairs in order”.  On the other hand,
    Mallory did insist that he intended to turn himself in eventually.  Arguably,
    this claim opened the door to reply evidence to show that Mallory never intended
    to surrender.  However, as the Crown led evidence in its own case of the
    very arrangements Mallory described in his evidence, it is difficult to see
    how this could be proper reply.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[149]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, even if the Crown was entitled to lead reply evidence relating
    to the circumstances of the arrest, we fail to see any basis for the admission
    of hearsay evidence to the effect that Mallory had admitted a role in the
    murders to his girlfriend. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[150]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the trial judge was seriously led astray by the Crown’s insistence
    that Davidson be permitted to testify that, immediately before the arrest,
    Donna Delaney told him that she thought Mallory’s only role “was driving
    the car.”  While there was some suggestion that Delaney got that information
    from a newspaper, there is no doubt that the Crown’s position was that Mallory
    had told her that he was only the driver. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[151]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    cross-examination, Mallory was asked: “… you told Donna Delaney, your girlfriend,
    that all you did was drive the car, didn’t you?” Mallory denied that he had
    said anything like that to Donna Delaney.  The Crown did not call Donna Delaney
    to prove this admission as part of its case.  The matter should have ended
    with Mallory’s denial. Simply put, the Crown had not called Donna Delaney,
    and after Mallory’s denial, the Crown had no admissible evidence of any admission
    that Mallory had made to her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[152]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    find it difficult to avoid the conclusion that Davidson’s reply evidence
    was led by the Crown essentially for the purpose of putting gravely prejudicial
    hearsay evidence before the jury by suggesting that Mallory had admitted
    involvement with the commission of the murders.  The Crown argued that Davidson’s
    evidence regarding what Delaney said should be admitted as “part of the narrative” of
    the arrest.  The trial judge accepted that submission and ruled that the “words
    are relevant to a non-hearsay use for the words spoken, what was really happening
    at the time and what the accused’s real purpose might have been, and Delaney’s
    role in meeting police at the door of the townhouse, if any.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[153]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our respectful view, this reasoning is flawed. To use Delaney’s hearsay statement
    as evidence of “what the accused’s real purpose might have been” is to use
    it precisely for the forbidden purpose of inferring that the accused had
    admitted involvement in the crime.  The real purpose of leading this evidence
    was revealed by the Crown’s submission to the trial judge that evidence of
    what Delaney said to Davidson could support the inference “that Mr. Mallory
    had a conversation with her in which he admitted a role in this incident.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[154]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge gave the jury a mid-trial instruction about the use it could
    make of the Delaney hearsay evidence.  He instructed the jury that it could
    not use it as evidence that Mallory had told Delaney that he was driving
    the car, that the only evidence on that issue was Mallory’s denial of any
    admission to Delaney, and that Mallory did not hear Delaney relay an alleged
    admission to Davidson.  The trial judge told the jury that the Delaney hearsay
    evidence could be used “as to what was happening at the time of the arrest,
    how the arrest was effected … in the total context of what was happening
    over the three days when the police were trying to get in touch with Mallory … But
    it cannot be used to say Mr. Mallory must have told her that he was driving
    the car”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[155]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    this direction went some way to repair the damage, in the end, we are of
    the view that this evidence was gravely prejudicial inadmissible hearsay
    evidence that the jury should never have heard.  The Delaney hearsay evidence
    shed no light on the circumstances of the arrest other than to show that
    Mallory had admitted to having had some involvement in the crime, and we
    are not persuaded that the harm done to Mallory was sufficiently relieved
    by the limiting instruction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[156]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we would give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h3>8. A ruling permitting cross-examination of Mallory about evidence he gave
    at his bail hearing</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[157]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mallory
    gave evidence at trial that contradicted the evidence he gave at his bail
    hearing, both about his activities as an enforcer and about his relationship
    with Stewart. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[158]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, over the objection of his counsel, the Crown cross-examined Mallory
    on those contradictions.  In that cross-examination, Mallory admitted to
    lying at his bail hearing.  The Crown used these admissions to attack Mallory’s
    overall credibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[159]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mallory
    argues that s. 518(1)(b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> prohibited the Crown
    from cross-examining him “respecting the offence” at his bail hearing and
    that cross-examination on the answers he gave should therefore have been
    prohibited at trial.  Section 518(1)(b) provides that at a bail hearing:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he accused shall not be examined by the justice
    or any other person except counsel for the accused <u>respecting the offence</u> with
    which the accused is charged, and no inquiry shall be made of the accused
    respecting the offence by way of cross-examination <u>unless the accused
    has testified respecting that offence</u> …
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[160]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the first issue is whether the Crown examined Mallory at his bail hearing “respecting
    the offence”.  If so, the second issue is whether Mallory opened the door
    to such questioning by giving evidence respecting the offence in his examination-in-chief.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[161]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the bail hearing, the Crown opposed Mallory’s release on two grounds.  First,
    the Crown was concerned that Mallory, who it alleged worked as Stewart’s
    enforcer, would intimidate and interfere with witnesses on the murder charges.  Second,
    the Crown was concerned about Mallory’s potential to re-offend. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[162]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    support of its position, the Crown called a police officer who testified
    that it was the police theory that Mallory was involved in the murders on
    Stewart’s instructions. That officer testified that he had information that
    Mallory worked for Stewart as his enforcer and about various incidents of
    witness intimidation in which Mallory was involved.  The officer testified
    specifically about threats to Gaudreault’s sister, brother-in-law, spouse,
    and to the individual who found the victims’ bodies, all of whom were potential
    witnesses regarding the murders.  In addition, the officer testified about
    information that Mallory enforced debts unrelated to the murders by intimidating
    debtors, including, for example, an occasion when Mallory attended in Toronto
    to collect a $20,000 debt from a man named Ivan Integra. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[163]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    his bail hearing, in-chief, Mallory professed his innocence of the murders.  He
    stated that, if released, he would find a place to live with the assistance
    of Stewart and Stewart’s father. He said he would support himself on welfare,
    but he anticipated that he would quickly obtain employment because “I’m well
    known among the hotels because I was a bouncer for quite a few years.”  This
    exchange was followed by questions put to him by his counsel with these responses:</p>

    for something they did not do and, you know, every other charge I’ve done
    I pled guilty to, I’ve done it, I’ve admitted to it, and me I feel like this

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[164]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    cross-examination, the Crown began by asking Mallory whether the admissions
    obtained by the police from his co-accused were all lies.  On the basis of
    s. 518(1)(b), the defence objected.  The Crown responded that Mallory had “opened
    the door” by professing his innocence.  The bail judge ruled that Mallory’s
    profession of innocence was no more than an affirmation of his not guilty
    plea and that it did not permit the Crown to question him respecting the
    offence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[165]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown then asked Mallory if he was involved in collecting drug debts for
    Stewart.  The defence again objected.  The Crown gave his assurance that
    he would stay away from asking about the murders, but sought to cross-examine
    Mallory about earlier acts of intimidation in the course of his employment
    for Stewart.  The bail judge permitted this line of questioning. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[166]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    Mallory acknowledged his role as an enforcer for Stewart, he minimized the
    extent of his involvement by saying he had only done a few collections for
    minimal amounts of debt, which were incurred for reasons to which he was
    not privy.  On other questions, such as those about the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto trip involving Integra, he testified that his memory was impaired
    by the large amount of cocaine he took at the time. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[167]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, Mallory openly acknowledged his role as an enforcer for Stewart and
    that as an enforcer he threatened and intimidated people to collect drug
    debts for large amounts of money.  He also remembered the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    Toronto enforcement trip. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[168]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mallory’s
    trial counsel objected to the Crown cross-examining Mallory about his contradictory
    evidence, based on s. 518(1)(b). The trial judge ruled:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am not satisfied that the section was violated
    by the court in the bail hearing.  The influence question was somewhat linked
    to what his job was in relation to Stewart before any of these events happened
    and it seems to me that is all relevant to that issue. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[169]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the trial judge allowed the Crown to continue with this line of questioning,
    Mallory acknowledged he had lied repeatedly during his bail evidence, but
    minimized it as “a little white lie” told in the hopes of securing his interim
    release.  He attributed some of his lack of truthfulness to “a mistake … a
    failed recollection”.  The Crown then read in large portions of the bail
    transcript.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[170]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her address to the jury, the trial Crown emphasized, because Mallory “committed
    perjury” at the bail hearing, that his trial testimony should not be believed:</p>
  <p>To be clear, the Crown’s position is that Mr. Mallory didn’t take the stand
    just to lie for Stewart, just to protect his boss or just to put his boss
    back on the street.  He lied in order to get away with murder himself.  He
    committed perjury on two different occasions but for a similar purpose at
    his bail hearings – to get himself out of jail, he said so, he admitted that.  He
    wasn’t testifying at somebody else’s bail hearings, he wasn’t trying to—he
    wasn’t perjuring himself in order to get Stewart out of jail at his bail
    hearings, he didn’t lie to protect Stewart then, his perjuries were totally
    self-serving at his bail hearings, and those earlier perjuries were committed,
    as he told you, so that he could buy himself temporary freedom of release
    before trial.  Five years in custody awaiting trial he felt were too much
    and it was clear that he felt entitled almost to lie to get out or to try
    to get out at his bail hearings … If five years of waiting for trial were
    enough reason to lie, well the desire to stop at this point must be double
    the reason.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[171]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    this court, Mallory did not seek to revisit the ruling of the bail judge,
    but argued that the evidence from the bail hearing should have been excluded
    from the trial as a violation of s. 518(1)(b).  Mallory did not pursue an
    argument based on s. 13 of the <i>Charter </i>because that issue has been
    determined by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Henry</i> (2005), 202
    C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.).  Although Mallory’s counsel relied upon s. 7 of
    the <i>Charter</i>, it was its position that s. 518(1)(b) provides greater
    protection to an accused than would s. 7.  Accordingly, the success of the
    argument depends on whether s. 518(1)(b) was transgressed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[172]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    essence, Mallory’s counsel argued that evidence about Mallory’s work for
    Stewart as an enforcer, the amount of money he collected, and his trip to
    Toronto were all central to the Crown’s theory that he was a drug enforcer
    for Stewart and participated in the murders in that capacity.  It follows,
    Mallory’s counsel submits, that questions about his enforcement activities
    fall squarely within the scope of questions “respecting the offence” and
    that the trial judge erred in his decision to permit the cross-examination. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[173]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown submits that s. 518(1)(b) was not violated because Mallory was not
    questioned with respect to the offence for which he was charged, only about
    his history of intimidating debtors and witnesses.  The Crown further argues
    to the extent the bail Crown did question Mallory about his relationship
    with Stewart and his enforcement activities, that evidence was first elicited
    by his own counsel. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[174]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Where
    an accused testifies at his bail hearing, he generally may be questioned
    with respect to the issues as defined by s. 515(10) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  In
    this case, the Crown placed specific reliance on the secondary grounds set
    out in s. 515(10)(b), that Mallory’s detention was “necessary for the protection
    or safety of the public, including any victim of or witness to the offence,
    having regard to all the circumstances including any substantial likelihood
    that the accused will, if released from custody, commit a criminal offence

        Deom</i>, <i>supra</i>, the bail judge questioned the fifty-three accused
        about the offences with which they were charged, asking essentially whether
        they were present and involved.  Similarly, in <i>R. v. Paonessa and
        Paquette</i>, <i>supra</i>, the accused, who was charged with arson at
        a billiard hall, was questioned by his own counsel about whether he was
        present at the billiard hall at the time of the incident and whether
        he brought a container of gasoline to the site.  In both cases, the accuseds’
    admissions, which had a direct bearing on their guilt for the offences charged,
    were held to be impermissible and inadmissible at trial.  The factual circumstances

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[177]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Here,
      the bail judge was alive to the issue and ruled specifically that “cross-examination

      Thereafter, the Crown restricted its questions at the bail hearing to Mallory’s
      enforcement activities that were unrelated to the murders.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[178]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In
      our view, Mallory raised the issue of his pre-charge employment in examination-in-chief,
      thereby opening the door to the questions in his cross-examination. When
      considered in context, his answers to the questions asked by his counsel
      were to the effect that, if released, he anticipated employment in his
      previous law abiding occupation as a bouncer. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[179]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Moreover,
      Mallory’s own counsel questioned Mallory about his potential to intimidate
      witnesses.  In response, Mallory said that “there should be no fear of
      that actually” because “witnesses intimidate themselves”. Implicit in this
      response is a denial of any role as an intimidator. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[180]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In
      addition, Mallory denied any likelihood that if released he would commit
      further offences when he said he intended to leave behind his criminal
      ways.  By these responses, Mallory left himself open to cross-examination
      both about his livelihood and his history as an enforcer, provided the
      questions did not extend to questions about the murders. We believe they
      did not for four reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[181]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the questions related solely to Mallory’s earlier enforcement work for Stewart
    and he was not asked about any enforcement activities even remotely related
    to the murders. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[182]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the questions, which were relevant to the Crown’s s. 515(10) concern that
    Mallory’s release would provide him with the opportunity to intimidate potential
    witnesses, were not posed for any oblique or impermissible purpose. They
    had no self-incrimination component to them and nor was any incriminating
    evidence relevant to the murders elicited, even incidentally.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[183]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the Crown retreated from any questions about Mallory’s intimidation of persons
    relevant to the murders, such as the Gravelles, and specifically restricted
    his questions to Mallory’s unrelated enforcement activities, such as against
    Integra.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[184]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    there was an important difference between Mallory’s professed role as an
    enforcer and the charges of murder.  They were not one and the same.  This
    is evident from Mallory’s own evidence at trial where he readily acknowledged
    his enforcer role but denied that he resorted to routine physical violence
    or to the use of guns.  This portrayal of his role as a gentle enforcer is
    in sharp contrast to the charges at issue of the deliberate shooting and
    killing of two people.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[185]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, we conclude that the trial judge did not err in allowing the
    trial Crown to cross-examine Mallory about his bail testimony on the issue
    of his credibility. Accordingly, we would not give effect to this ground
    of appeal. </p>
  <h3>9. A ruling editing transcripts of statements made by Stewart to Smallwood,
    a jailhouse informant, to exclude Stewart’s exculpatory statements</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[186]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>John
    Smallwood testified that in taped conversations, Stewart admitted to knowledge
    of the victims and to the murders.  These admissions, if believed, were damning.  However,
    the defence challenged the reliability of the admissions and argued that
    Stewart’s utterances did not amount to an admission that he knew the victims
    and that the alleged admission of the murders was nothing more than a sarcastic
    comment by Stewart, as evidenced by his repeated denials of guilt elsewhere
    on the tape.  The trial judge admitted portions of the statements that were
    inculpatory but excluded other portions that were exculpatory.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[187]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Smallwood,
    who had a lengthy record for fraud-related crimes and was awaiting extradition
    to the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    , was incarcerated on the same range as Stewart during Stewart’s trial.  After
    he befriended Stewart, Smallwood approached the correctional authorities
    offering information concerning the murders.
     The authorities wired Smallwood with a device that would record for seven
    and a half hours.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[188]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    resulting recording was of very poor quality. Much of it was inaudible. Since
    the Crown and defence were unable to agree on its contents, each produced
    their own transcript.  The trial judge edited out irrelevancies with the
    consent of counsel, including irrelevant conversations with other inmates.
    In the end, only two segments of the tape, totalling about twenty-five minutes,
    involved discussions between Smallwood, Stewart, and other inmates.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[189]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Smallwood
    testified that he interpreted Stewart’s statements as admissions that Stewart
    knew the victims and was involved in their murders.  He testified that Stewart’s
    statement, “That’s why I had to execute a quarter gram drug dealer”, was
    given in the context of a response to newspaper clippings Stewart had shown
    to Smallwood, including a clipping about a drug dealer wanting to make an
    example of a “deadbeat”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[190]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge admitted that statement together with the conversation that immediately
    followed, where Smallwood responded: “Man oh man oh man oh man.  Yeah that’s
    right, fourteen hundred kilos of cocaine, you had to execute a quarter gram
    dealer. Just good business,” followed by laughter.  A couple of lines later
    another participant in the conversation says to Stewart: “you’re not being
    serious with me”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[191]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence position was that the alleged admission was no more than a sarcastic
    retort, by which Stewart meant only that it made no sense for a large-scale
    drug dealer like himself to become involved in the murder of a small time
    drug dealer.  This position was based in part on an earlier discussion on
    the edited tape where Stewart said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>But it doesn’t make any sense (inaudible) have
    to put me in here.  Well where the fuck do they want me?  Either I’m the
    largest [drug dealer] in the city or I mean I’m down and selling ¼ grams.
    Even the narc said, the narc (inaudible) about a week telling them about
    how big a drug dealer I was (inaudible) in court (inaudible) but these people
    were not in the same league (inaudible) for the whole week. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>The Crown argued that this
    segment of the recording reflected an admission that Stewart knew the victims.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[192]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    other segments of the tape that the trial judge ruled inadmissible, Stewart
    spoke about his eight and a half years in jail, saying that if “we’d say
    we did it, we would’ve been out last year, but we’re refusing.”  This utterance
    referred to a possible plea bargain offered by the Crown and rejected by
    the defence.  Later in the recording, again in reference to the offered plea
    bargain, Stewart says, “I said I didn’t do it, I’m not … and she [Stewart’s
    lawyer] said good, then we’ll fight it.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[193]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also ruled inadmissible segments of the recording where Stewart
    referred to specific wrongful convictions in the Canadian justice system
    and referred to his trial as a “runaway” trial. On this inadmissible segment,
    Stewart also said, “[t]he whole thing is I’m a bad guy (inaudible) they’ll
    come in and, convict me of the murders (inaudible) and it wasn’t me (inaudible)
    justice.”  Later in the recording, Stewart said, “It’ll be nine years by
    the time we’re through, but we’re not guilty and we’re gonna have a trial
    and we’ll be found not guilty.  That’s it.” This too was excluded.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[194]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All
    these exculpatory utterances were uttered within minutes, and sometimes within
    seconds, of the inculpatory utterances that the trial judge ruled to be admissible. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[195]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    cross-examination, Smallwood testified that he never heard Stewart deny the
    murders.  In view of this testimony, Mallory’s counsel asked the trial judge
    to reconsider his earlier ruling and to permit cross-examination of Smallwood
    on Stewart’s denials of guilt.  The trial judge refused on the basis that
    Smallwood may have understood that Stewart did not
    “point blank” deny the offence.  Although the trial judge refused to revisit
    his earlier ruling, he allowed the defence to ask Smallwood whether Stewart
    had ever said “he’s not guilty of the offence”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[196]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    response to that question, Smallwood testified that he had heard Stewart
    deny any involvement, but he could not recall if he did so during the recording.  The
    defence sought the opportunity to refresh Smallwood’s memory by reference
    to the recording. The trial judge denied the request. Mallory’s counsel stated
    that he was unable to continue with the cross-examination in light of that
    ruling. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[197]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence called another inmate who was present during the recording, Andrews.  Andrews
    testified that Stewart uttered the words in the recording, but maintained
    that Stewart was being sarcastic in the “confession”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[198]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the <i>voir dire</i> to admit the tapes, the Crown took the position that
    the exculpatory utterances were inadmissible as self-serving or prior consistent
    statements.  Stewart’s counsel did not directly refer to the “whole statement” rule,
    although she did make reference to the admission of the entire statement.
    Stewart’s counsel submitted that the requested exculpatory utterances were
    necessary to provide the context of Stewart’s state of mind at the time he
    made the inculpatory utterance. She submitted that his utterances of innocence
    put the inculpatory utterance in context, showing it to be no more than a
    sarcastic comment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[199]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his first ruling, the trial judge relied on the general principle that “out
    of court statements by an accused ‘are receivable in evidence against him
    but not for him.’”  He held that he was unable to conclude that a state of
    mind exception was available to the defence because there is “nothing in
    the maintenance of innocence in itself that gives any indication that confession
    is coming.”  The trial judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[P]rior talk of innocence does not render confession
    any less likely, and is not circumstantial evidence showing confession to
    be less likely.  <i>A fortiori</i>, then if a jury cannot consider the talk
    of innocence for its truth of what possible use is it to tell them that the
    words were spoken since they are not relevant to state of mind?  Confession
    replaces innocence with a new reality.  It is Mr. Stewart who can fill in
    the transition by saying it happened or it didn’t happen.  Mr. Smallwood
    is the rapporteur of the words.  Mr. Stewart is the source of the meaning. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[200]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    defence counsel did not raise the “whole statement” principle before the
    initial ruling, she did so later when she asked the trial judge to revisit
    the matter during Smallwood’s cross-examination.  At that point, the trial
    judge ruled that he had considered that principle, but that he did not see
    a contextual link between the exculpatory and inculpatory statements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[201]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown’s address and the trial judge’s charge gave added emphasis to the inculpatory
    utterances.  The Crown argued before the jury that while Smallwood’s background
    may have made his evidence “problematic”, the fact that the statements were
    recorded made the “confession accompanied by an explanation [statements]
    that you can rely on.”  The Crown also argued that the jury could rely on
    Smallwood’s evidence because he put himself at considerable risk to tape
    Stewart.  In total, the Crown spent fifteen pages of transcript addressing
    the jury on the issue of Stewart’s “confession”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[202]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his charge, the trial judge reviewed Stewart’s inculpatory statements. Contrary
    to the evidence, he noted that Smallwood testified that “Rob Stewart never
    told him that he had not killed ‘these people’”.  On the other hand, counsel
    for Stewart explained her lack of emphasis on Andrews’s testimony about the
    sarcastic tone of the “confession” by saying to the trial judge: “I didn’t
    think anyone would really believe Smallwood.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[203]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the trial judge erred in approaching the utterances as a series
    of separate statements rather than as one statement.  It is well accepted
    that if the Crown tenders the statement of an accused, it cannot pick and
    choose those parts of the statement that it would like the jury to hear;
    it must take “the good with the bad”, and both the “good” and the “bad” are
    admitted for their truth, for and against the accused.  Moreover, a party
    wishing to adduce a statement must put in as much of the statement as is
    necessary to permit a fair understanding of the individual utterances.  </p>

    and when there is not this strict obligation or when it is not fulfilled
    the accused or the opposite party has a right to put in the favourable portion
    which has been omitted; and the favourable portion is evidence for the accused
    or the opposite party, equally with the unfavourable portion, at least in
    this sense, that it must be taken as interpreting the unfavourable part,
    which cannot be given a meaning as it stood by itself but only as modified
    by the favourable part. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[207]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately,
    this issue became confused at trial by counsel’s focus on whether the exculpatory
    utterances could be admitted as an exception to the rule against prior consistent
    or self-serving statements on the part of the accused, which are generally
    inadmissible because they have no probative value.  By parsing the recording
    into separate utterances, the trial judge was distracted from considering
    whether the “whole statement” should be admitted.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[208]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown acknowledges that the trial judge in this case spoke too generally
    when he said “prior talk of innocence does not render confession any less
    likely.”  The meaning of an exculpatory utterance proximate to an inculpatory
    utterance is for the jury to determine in the context of the “whole statement”.  Giving
    the jury an isolated utterance taken out of context deprives the jury of
    the opportunity to decide the true meaning of the whole statement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[209]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    recording was one statement and not a series of statements.  In addition

  <h3>10. A ruling regarding the scope of Stewart’s cross-examination</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[212]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior
    to deciding whether Stewart would testify, his trial counsel sought a ruling
    regarding the scope of the Crown’s proposed cross-examination.  The defence
    sought to prohibit the Crown from cross-examining Stewart on inculpatory
    out-of-court utterances he purportedly made to certain unsavoury witnesses,
    including jailhouse informants, whom the Crown chose not to call in its case.  The
    trial judge rejected this request and declined to impose limits on the Crown’s
    cross-examination.  For the following reasons, we accept the appellants’ submission
    that the trial judge erred in his ruling. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[213]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    argument that arose at trial must be put into context. After a lengthy pre-trial
    abuse of process motion, the trial judge refused to exclude the evidence
    of jailhouse informants generally.  He also did not accede to the defence
    request for a <i>voir dire</i> to test the evidence of the particular jailhouse
    informants in this case for two reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[214]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge ruled that the evidence of jailhouse informants is not presumptively
    unreliable and that the defence did not demonstrate a sufficient factual
    and legal basis to establish the need for a <i>voir dire</i> in this case:
    see <i>R. v. Kutynec</i> (1992), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 289 at 302 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  These rulings are not under appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[215]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    these rulings, the Crown called two jailhouse informants.  It chose not to
    call many others, including the informants about whom it proposed to cross-examine
    Stewart. Although we do not have a list of those informants, the defence
    counsel’s submissions at trial refer to fifteen such individuals, including
    George Metrakos, Andrew Hayden, Claude Bard, Jack Trudel, Ricky Nelson, Paul
    Beland, and Kevin Trudeau, all of whom were unsavoury witnesses and three
    of whom were also jailhouse informants.  In addition, both Jack Trudel and
    Bard had recanted their statements. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[216]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    alleged inculpatory admission Stewart made to Metrakos raised a particular
    concern because the defence at trial questioned the Crown’s good faith basis
    for using that admission in Stewart’s cross-examination. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[217]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the trial, the defence relied on <i>R. v. Howard</i> (1989), 48 C.C.C. (3d)
    38 (S.C.C.), which<span style='font-size:11.0pt;
'> </span>had not yet been clarified as it later was in <i>R. v. Lyttle</i> (2004),
    180 C.C.C. (3d) 476 (S.C.C.).  In <i>R. v. Howard</i>, at 46, Lamer J. said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is not open to the examiner or cross-examiner
    to put as a fact, or even a hypothetical fact, that which is not and will
    not become part of the case as admissible evidence. On this ground alone,
    the question should have been denied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[218]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    though Lamer J. did not refer to authorities or provide analysis, some interpreted
    this passage as changing the law to prohibit cross-examination on otherwise
    admissible facts that had not been proven in evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[219]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this basis, Stewart’s trial counsel made three arguments.  First, in accordance
    with <i>R. v. Howard</i>, <i>supra</i>, the Crown should not be permitted
    to cross-examine Stewart on the alleged admissions because, as the Crown
    could not call the informants in reply without splitting its case, the admissions
    were not
    “admissible”.  Second, since the statements came from unsavoury witnesses
    or jailhouse informants, they should be considered presumptively unreliable.  Third,
    because Stewart would simply deny making each statement, the probative value
    of his responses would be outweighed by the prejudicial effect of the questions,
    and any caution by the trial judge would be insufficient to remedy the prejudice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[220]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the defence argument, the trial judge suggested that the problem would be
    resolved if the Crown was permitted to call the informants in reply. To this,
    the defence responded that such reply evidence would be extremely prejudicial
    and an impermissible splitting of the Crown’s case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[221]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her argument, Crown counsel took the position that <i>R. v. Howard</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    prohibited cross-examination only on evidence that was inadmissible. Provided
    the Crown had the necessary foundation, the Crown was entitled to reserve
    admissions to informants for the purpose of challenging the accused during
    cross-examination. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[222]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the issue of prejudice, the Crown argued that even denials of the admissions
    would be probative because the jury would have the opportunity to draw conclusions
    from Stewart’s demeanour.  Finally, the Crown argued there was no reason
    to believe that jurors would not comply with the usual instruction cautioning
    them that suggestions contained in questions asked by counsel must not be
    used as evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[223]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his brief ruling, the trial judge accepted the Crown argument that cross-examination
    on unproven but admissible statements was permissible, provided the Crown
    had a reasonable foundation for the questions.  Without consideration of
    the potentially prejudicial effect of the cross-examination, the trial judge
    ruled that the Crown was entitled to conduct an unrestricted cross-examination
    of Stewart on all the purported admissions and the details of their surrounding
    circumstances. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[224]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    light of this ruling, the defence advised the court that Stewart would not
    testify.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[225]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    the time of this appeal, any confusion resulting from <i>R. v. Howard</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    was resolved by the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <i>R. v. Lyttle</i>, <i>supra</i>.
    After discussing the importance of the right to cross-examine, the Supreme
    Court in <i>R. v. Lyttle</i> noted, at para. 63, that the “conclusion that <i>Howard</i> mandates
    or authorizes the requirement of an evidentiary foundation for every factual
    suggestion put to a witness (expert or not) in cross-examination is misplaced.”
     The Supreme Court also confirmed, at para. 47, that counsel is entitled
    to cross-examine a witness “regarding matters that will not be proven independently,
    provided that counsel has a good faith basis for putting the question”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[226]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
    the clarification in <i>R. v. Lyttle</i>, <i>supra</i>, the appellants argue
    that the trial judge should have prohibited the proposed Crown cross-examination
    for three reasons. First, such a cross-examination was tantamount to the
    Crown impermissibly splitting its case. Second, the trial Crown did not have
    a good faith foundation to support the cross-examination.  Third, particularly
    with respect to the Metrakos information, the cumulative effect of repeated
    suggestions by the Crown that Stewart admitted his involvement in the murders
    created the innuendo that he must have made at least some of those admissions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[227]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    reply, the Crown urges us to interpret the trial Crown’s submissions as reflecting
    her good faith foundation for the Metrakos information and, regarding the
    other issues, argues that the record is insufficient for this court to reach
    a conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[228]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, although the trial judge was correct in concluding that counsel
    may cross-examine on matters which will not be proven in evidence, he erred
    in concluding that the trial Crown had established the requisite foundation
    to cross-examine Stewart on the Metrakos information.  Furthermore, the trial
    judge erred in failing to weigh the prejudicial effect of the proposed cross-examination
    against its probative value.  In our view, extensive, detailed questions
    about the circumstances of the alleged admissions, followed by <i>seriatim</i> denials
    of those admissions, had the potential to be irretrievably prejudicial, notwithstanding
    any caution to not consider the Crown’s suggestions as evidence.  The trial
    judge ought to have considered whether the proposed line of questioning should
    be either restricted or prohibited. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[229]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, counsel were able to agree on four overarching principles. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[230]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    voluntary admissions by an accused are generally admissible for their truth
    as an exception to the hearsay rule. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[231]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    although a <i>voir dire</i> is required to establish the voluntariness of
    an admission to the police, or to another person in authority, generally
    no <i>voir dire</i> is required if the admission is made to a person not
    in authority, even if that person is an unsavoury witness or a jailhouse
    informant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[232]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the Crown is entitled to call the evidence it chooses in its case, provided
    that it does not call any evidence with an
    “oblique motive”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[233]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    the Crown is not prohibited from reserving evidence for cross-examination
    that was not called in-chief, provided the evidence is not otherwise inadmissible,
    the Crown has a good faith basis in the foundation for its question, the
    Crown is not splitting its case, and the prejudicial effect of the cross-examination
    does not outweigh its probative value.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[234]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    will deal first with the question of the good faith requirement in relation
    to the Metrakos evidence, then with the question of the prejudicial effect
    of the proposed cross-examination, and finally with the argument that the
    proposed cross-examination amounted to a splitting of the Crown’s case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[235]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    existence of a good faith basis for the proposed cross-examination of Stewart
    raises the issue of the role of the Crown, which was famously set out in <i>R.
    v. Boucher</i> (1954), 110 C.C.C. 263 at 270 (S.C.C.):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It cannot be over-emphasized that the purpose of
    a criminal prosecution is not to obtain a conviction; it is to lay before
    a jury <u>what the Crown considers to be credible evidence </u>relevant to
    what is alleged to be a crime.  Counsel have a duty to see that all available
    legal proof of the facts is presented: it should be done firmly and pressed
    to its legitimate strength, but it must also be done fairly.  The role of
    prosecutor excludes any notion of winning or losing; his [or her] function
    is a matter of public duty than which in civil life there can be none charged
    with greater personal respon-sibility.  It is to be efficiently performed
    with an ingrained sense of the dignity, the seriousness and the justness
    of judicial proceedings. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[236]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue is whether the Crown considered the Metrakos information to be credible

    trial Crown referred to its procedures for screening the evidence of such
    witnesses and advised that it had convened a meeting to consider the Kaufman-type
    witnesses in the Mallory and Stewart trial, even though the Kaufman recommendations
    had only recently been released.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[241]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regarding
    its internal deliberations about Metrakos, the trial Crown submitted:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>When Mr. Kaufman wrote this report it was not the
    first time it occurred to us that the credibility of witnesses was in issue.
    We’ve been making these decisions all along.  We had eliminated [another
    witness] at the preliminary hearing and I can say that we had eliminated
    Mr. Metrakos from our witness list before we put it to anybody’s review.
    These aren’t new issues.  They’re not framed in any new constructs. Kaufman
    is in essence, in my submission, and I’m speaking only for myself, only a
    codification of what our job has always been. We take these issues very seriously
    and we always have.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[242]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, given its context, the trial Crown was clearly stating that she
    had rejected the Metrakos evidence as unreliable for reasons related to the
    concerns raised by the Kaufman report.  We see no other reasonable interpretation
    for her submission, despite the able argument of the Crown on appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[243]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the trial Crown referred to Kaufman-like concerns in her submissions on the
    eve of trial, when faced with the argument that the trial could not proceed
    until after a Kaufman review had been conducted, she took a different position
    when she sought to elicit Metrakos’s information from Lamarche during her
    hearsay re-examination.  When the Metrakos name was raised in that context,
    the trial judge, correctly recalling the earlier discussion, properly queried
    the Crown’s foundation:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There’s some factual basis about Metrakos that,
    to be frank, troubles me a little bit. It’s been said in the courtroom that
    he’s not being called, I mean I have no reason to know but if he’s not being
    called in part because of the recommendations of the [Kaufman] Committee …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[244]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown replied with a definitive and emphatic “no”
    to that inquiry saying, “It’s a much more localized decision,” unrelated
    to concerns about credibility and reliability. When queried further, in apparent
    contradiction to her earlier opinion, the Crown emphatically confirmed that
    the decision not to call Metrakos was motivated for other reasons and “Kaufman
    had nothing to do with that decision”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[245]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  Since
    the trial judge accepted this explanation, Lamarche told the jury in re-examination
    that, in part, she pursued her investigation against Stewart and Mallory
    because she relied on statements from Metrakos and some of the other informants. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[246]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was with this background that the Crown later proposed to cross-examine Stewart
    about his alleged admissions to Metrakos.  Based on the earlier assurances
    of the Crown, the trial judge accepted the existence of the requisite foundation
    and did not make further inquiries. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[247]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the issue in this case is more about Crown conduct than it is about any error
    on the part of the trial judge, it is helpful to consider the requirement
    for a good faith foundation in light of the intervening decision of the Supreme
    Court in <i>R. v. Lyttle</i>, <i>supra</i>. In <i>R. v. Lyttle</i>, at para.
    48, the Supreme Court describes how “‘a good faith basis’ is a function of
    the information available to the cross-examiner, his or her belief in its
    likely accuracy, and the purpose for which it is used.”  This requirement
    provides an important safeguard to prevent undue prejudice to the accused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[248]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    ensure that this safeguard is present, a trial judge is required to ensure
    there is a good faith foundation for questions posed in cross-examination.  Where
    the good faith foundation is challenged, to ensure a fair trial, <i>R. v.
    Lyttle</i>, <i>supra</i>, at paras. 51-52, requires the trial judge to make
    inquiries and, in appropriate cases, to consider holding a <i>voir dire</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A trial judge must balance the rights of an accused
    to receive a fair trial with the need to prevent unethical cross-examination.  There
    will thus be instances where a trial judge will want to ensure that “counsel
    [is] not merely taking a random shot at a reputation imprudently exposed
    or asking a groundless question to waft an unwarranted innuendo into the
    jury box”.  See <i>Michelson v.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    </i>, 335
    <st1:place

    469 (1948) at p. 481, per Jackson J.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where a question implies the existence of a disputed
    factual predicate that is manifestly tenuous or suspect, a trial judge may
    properly take appropriate steps, by conducting a <i>voir dire</i> or otherwise,
    to seek and obtain counsel’s assurance that a good faith basis exists for
    putting the question.  If the judge is satisfied in this regard and the question
    is not otherwise prohibited, counsel should be permitted to put the question
    to the witness<span
style='font-family:Tahoma;"Times New Roman"'>.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[249]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the procedure in <i>R. v. Lyttle</i>, <i>supra</i>, was set out in the context
    of a defence cross-examination of a Crown witness, the underlying principle
    would apply with even greater force to the Crown’s cross-examination of an
    accused.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[250]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, neither the Crown nor the defence sought a <i>voir dire </i>to
    resolve the issue.  This was so for two reasons.  First, <i>R. v. Lyttle</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    was decided after the Mallory and Stewart trial.  Second, the trial judge
    had earlier refused a <i>voir dire</i> when the Crown proposed to call the
    jailhouse informants and the unsavoury witnesses in its case and he accepted
    the Crown’s good faith basis for calling that evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[251]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    in our view, this issue should have been re-visited at the time of the proposed
    Stewart cross-examination.  We say this because there is an important distinction
    to be drawn between the Crown calling a jailhouse informant or unsavoury
    witness during its case, and the Crown proposing to use information from
    that jailhouse informant or unsavoury witness for the purpose of cross-examining
    an accused. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[252]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where
    the Crown intends to call the statement in its case, a <i>voir dire</i> may
    be unnecessary because the defence will have the opportunity to expose the
    frailties of the evidence in cross-examination.  The defence, however, will
    not have that opportunity when the Crown intends to use the information only
    in cross-examination of the accused. Where the Crown’s good faith foundation
    is challenged on reasonable grounds, and the suggestion put to the accused
    may be unfairly prejudicial, the proper course is for the Crown or the defence
    to seek a <i>voir dire</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=FR-CA>[253]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Even
    absent a <i>voir dire</i>, however, the authorities are clear that the Crown
    is not entitled to reject a witness’s evidence in its own case as unreliable
    and then use that unreliable evidence later to cross-examine the accused.  The
    Crown simply cannot have it both ways.  If the Crown does not call a witness
    because that witness’s statement is viewed as untruthful or unreliable, the
    Crown cannot later put suggestions to the accused during cross-examination
    on the basis of that statement: see <i>R. v. Wilson</i> (1983), 5 C.C.C.
    (3d) 61 (B.C. C.A.); <i>R. v. Dixon </i>(1984), 16 C.C.C. (3d) 43 (B.C. C.A.); <i>R.
    v. D.(C.) </i><span lang=FR-CA>(2001), 145 C.C.C. (3d) 290 (Ont. C.A.).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[254]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown on appeal properly concedes this point in its factum:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The respondent agrees that, as a matter of fundamental
    fairness, if evidence is too unreliable to be tendered in the Crown’s case,
    or if the Crown doubts its veracity, it should not be used in cross-examination
    of an accused, because such evidence would be incapable of providing a good
    faith basis for suggestions in cross-examination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[255]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    the trial Crown’s submission on the eve of trial indicated that she did not
    have a good faith foundation for calling Metrakos as a witness, in the absence
    of a clear explanation of that earlier submission, her proposed cross-examination
    on the Metrakos information should have been prohibited.  This error, caused
    by the Crown, was serious because it may have affected Stewart’s decision
    whether to testify.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[256]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    turn to consider the Crown’s proposed use of the statements of the other
    informants.  In doing so, we note that there was also a question about the
    Crown’s good faith foundation for referring to information from those individuals.  Only
    Hayden’s name passed the Kaufman Committee.  There were also issues that
    cast doubts on the reliability of other informers, particularly Bard, whose
    evidence had been rejected as unreliable by the same trial judge in the Sauvé
    and Trudel trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[257]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if satisfied about the Crown’s foundation for the other admissions, the trial
    judge erred in failing to consider whether their probative value was outweighed
    by their prejudicial effect.  We say this for two reasons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[258]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    since Stewart’s defence was based on a denial of any involvement in the murders,
    his repetitious denials of the admissions could have no probative value and
    would have been potentially prejudicial.  Despite warnings from the trial
    judge and the denials, on the facts of this case, we cannot discount the
    possibility that the jurors may have been influenced by the innuendo that
    would naturally arise from the questions posed time and again by the Crown. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[259]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    the purported admissions and their surrounding circumstances would be introduced,
    not through the evidence of the disreputable informants, but through the
    Crown, with no indication of the unsavoury character of the individuals who
    provided the information.  Moreover, Lamarche’s earlier evidence that her
    investigation relied in part on information from the same individuals created
    the risk that the jury would view information received from these individuals
    as apparently credible.  In these circumstances, we consider that there was
    a real risk a limiting instruction would not remedy the prejudicial effect
    of the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[260]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    in light of the denials, it would be irrelevant whether Stewart knew the
    informant, as would be the circumstances of the admissions, because the only
    admissible evidence was that the admissions were never made. In short, the
    Crown’s proposed cross-examination of Stewart about the circumstances surrounding
    the admissions, and his relationship with the informants, would have no relevance
    and no probative value. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[261]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the Supreme Court stated in <i>R. v. Lyttle</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 45,
    although the right to cross-examine is vitally important, a trial judge has
    a broad discretion, and we say an obligation, to “ensure fairness and to
    see that justice is done – and seen to be done.”  In exercising that discretion,
    a trial judge will restrict cross-examination when the prejudicial effect
    of the questions posed outweighs their probative value.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[262]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    note again that the evidence of unsavoury witnesses, including jailhouse
    informants, may be called by the Crown in-chief without a <i>voir dire</i> because
    the accused will have an opportunity in cross-examination to demonstrate
    the frailties of the evidence. In addition, during and subsequent to that
    testimony, the trial judge will caution the jury about the inherent dangers
    of accepting the evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[263]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    same safeguards, however, are not present when the Crown saves the admissions
    for the purposes of cross-examining the accused.  The cross-examination becomes
    problematic in cases such as this one where the Crown proposes to spend a
    prolonged period cross-examining the accused about a series of admissions
    to a series of jailhouse informants with particular attention to the details
    about the circumstances of each admission.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[264]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    such a case, the accused would not have the opportunity even to cross-examine
    the informants to provide the jurors with the necessary tools to weigh the
    informants’ credibility.  In addition, while the Crown will have made the
    suggestions that the accused repeatedly confessed to the crime, the jurors
    may not know that the foundation for those suggestions came from jailhouse
    informants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[265]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    those circumstances, the standard judicial caution about the irrelevance
    of Crown’s suggestions may be inadequate to offset the potential prejudice
    to the accused. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[266]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is no answer to the problem to say, as was said in this case, that the Crown
    could call the informants in reply.  This would only create an impermissible
    splitting of the Crown’s case, which would operate to the grave prejudice
    of the accused.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[267]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the end, the available record does not disclose a description of the Crown’s
    proposed line of questioning, or provide a list of the proposed informants
    and admissions, sufficient to conclude with certainty that the prejudicial
    effect of this line of questioning would have resulted in unfair prejudice
    to Stewart.  This question must be left to the trial judge presiding at the
    new trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[268]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    ascertaining the full scope of the cross-examination proposed by the Crown,
    the trial judge will be in a position to weigh the relevant factors to determine
    whether the Crown’s good faith in the reliability of the evidence is justified,
    and to balance the probative value of the cross-examination against the dangers
    of cumulative suggestions by the Crown about information provided by unsavoury
    witnesses and jailhouse informants. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[269]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    making a decision whether to limit the proposed cross-examination, the trial
    judge should consider the scope of the cross-examination proposed by the
    Crown, the relevance of a prolonged cross-examination about the circumstances
    surrounding the admissions, any repetitious nature of the cross-examination,
    the relevance of any recantations, the character of the recipients of the
    purported admissions as unsavoury witnesses and jailhouse informants, and
    any other circumstance that would affect the determination of whether the
    prejudicial effect of the proposed cross-examination is out of proportion
    to its probative value. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[270]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regarding
    the argument that the Crown was attempting to split its case, it is common
    ground that the Crown was not entitled to and did not intend to call the
    informants in reply.  Rather, as the Crown conceded, if Stewart denied the
    admissions, it would be bound by his answers. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[271]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, we conclude on the basis of the whole record that the trial
    Crown failed to provide a good faith foundation for cross-examining Stewart
    on the Metrakos statement.  In addition, the trial judge erred in failing
    to weigh the prejudicial effect and probative value of the information from
    the other informants.  Accordingly, we would give effect to this ground of
    appeal.</p>
  <h3>11.    The admissibility of “oath-helping” evidence relating to Winn, a
    jailhouse informant</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[272]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Michael
    Winn, an unsavoury witness and jailhouse informant, was the Crown’s first
    witness. His evidence was a central component of the Crown’s case.  Winn
    testified that Stewart and Mallory both admitted their involvement in the
    murders while he was in custody with them in 1991. In addition to many other
    admissions, Winn testified that Mallory told him, “Sauvé
    just went nuts and it didn’t have to be like that, he just went crazy.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[273]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    information, if believed, may have led the jury to its conclusion that Stewart
    was guilty of first degree murder and Mallory of second degree murder. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[274]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the significance of Winn’s evidence, and his position as a jailhouse informant,
    his credibility was critical.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[275]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the Crown improperly bolstered Winn’s otherwise suspect
    evidence in examination-in-chief in three ways.  First, the Crown elicited
    evidence about Winn’s rehabilitation, evidence that the Crown argues was
    relevant to his status as a jailhouse informant and was, in any event, admissible
    on the question of whether a <i>Vetrovec</i><i> </i>warning was necessary. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[276]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    Winn’s evidence was bolstered because his statements were marked as a lettered
    exhibit at trial and because the jury was provided with a transcript of his
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[277]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the Crown elicited evidence from Winn that, as a result of the information
    Winn gave the police, other individuals had been convicted of serious crimes
    and received significant sentences.  The appellants also submit that the
    prejudice occasioned by this evidence was not remedied by the mid-trial caution
    given to the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[278]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    evidence that bolsters credibility is admissible if tendered for some other
    permissible purpose, such as corroboration of other testimony, the rule against
    oath-helping prohibits the introduction of evidence for the sole purpose
    of establishing that a witness is credible before his or her credibility
    is attacked:  see <i>R. v. B.(F.F.)</i> (1993), 79 C.C.C. (3d) 112 (S.C.C.); <i>R.
    v. Burns </i>(1994), 89 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.).  Evidence is precluded
    as oath-helping if its purpose is to prove a witness to be truthful, as contrasted
    with evidence called for the purpose of showing the witness’s statements
    to be true.</p>

  <p>The line to be drawn when evidence is considered to be oath helping is not
    always clear.  There is a distinction to be made between (1) <u>evidence
    about credibility</u> (<i>i.e</i>. in my opinion the witness is truthful),
    which is inadmissible and (2) <u>evidence about a feature of the witness’s
    behaviour</u> or testimony, which may be admissible even though it will likely
    have some bearing on the trier of fact’s ultimate determination of the question

    had an extensive criminal record by the time he was twenty-five years of
    age. In addition to the 71 convictions he amassed between 1985 and 1989,
    Winn admitted that he had committed hundreds of other break and enter offences,
    two arsons, and had conspired on two occasions to commit murder. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[282]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the Crown examined Winn at this trial in 1998, he began by canvassing Winn’s
    extensive criminal record.  He then elicited evidence from Winn that he had
    committed no crimes for the preceding nine years, he had overcome his drug
    addiction, and he had started a landscaping business.  To demonstrate his
    landscaping work, Winn rolled up his sleeves to show the jury his hands,
    which he described as calloused and dry. In the course of his examination,
    the Crown asked Winn:  “Now what has happened, if anything, sir, to let us,
    let the jury trust your word on something?”  Winn answered the question by
    referring to his rehabilitation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[283]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Months
    later, Winn was recalled.  He admitted that since he gave his evidence he

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[284]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    Winn was a jailhouse informant whose credibility was a central issue, it
    would have been anticipated that the jury would be told to treat his evidence
    with great caution and to look for supporting evidence.  The evidence about
    Winn’s rehabilitation was relevant to his credibility as a jailhouse informant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[285]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence about Winn’s rehabilitation was not overemphasized by the Crown
    and was kept subordinate to the evidence about his unsavoury past and his
    position as a jailhouse informant.  It would have been apparent to the jury
    that Winn’s professed rehabilitation was one of many relevant factors in
    their assessment of his reliability as a jailhouse informant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[286]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    was not a case like <i>R. v. Clarke</i> (1981), 63 C.C.C. (2d) 224 (Alta.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), where the Crown exceeded permissible limits by eliciting evidence about
    reformation that was disproportionate to its probative value.  Accordingly,
    the Crown was entitled by way of introductory evidence to ask Winn about
    his criminal record and the gap in that record. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[287]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the appellants that it was improper for the trial Crown to pose
    the question to Winn, “what has happened … [to] let the jury trust your word
    on something?” Fortunately, however, Winn’s response to this question did
    not exacerbate the problem because he simply said, “I’ve been totally straight
    and away from crime, I’ve opened my own little business, for the past – since – well,
    I’ve been crime free since 1989 … I opened a little landscape business and
    I’m doing quite well.” By that response, Winn only reiterated the earlier
    information he had given about his reformation.  That response ameliorated
    any minimal prejudice to the appellants caused by the Crown’s question.  We
    are also of the view that any prejudice that arose from Winn exposing his
    hands, and describing them as calloused by his landscaping work, was inconsequential.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[288]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subject
    to the need for an adequate <i>Vetrovec</i> caution and our subsequent caveat
    about the need for an oath-helping caution, we see no error in the trial
    judge responding to the jury’s question by providing them with the requested
    transcript of Winn’s testimony. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[289]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Nor
    do we agree with the appellants’ argument that the prejudice from Winn’s
    evidence was exacerbated by counsel’s agreement to mark his statements as
    a lettered exhibit.
     From the transcript, it appears that the statements were marked as a lettered
    exhibit solely for the convenience of defence counsel, who used them extensively
    during their cross-examination of Winn. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[290]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a lettered exhibit, the statements did not form part of the evidence and
    in the circumstances of this case, including the absence of any objection
    at any time by the defence, there was no prejudice occasioned to the appellants. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[291]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    see no basis to conclude that the jury’s question during deliberations seeking
    a copy of Winn’s videotaped statement arose from the fact that the statements
    were made a lettered exhibit.  In any event, the trial judge refused the
    jury’s request and instead answered the jury’s alternative request by providing
    them with a copy of Winn’s transcript.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[292]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
    problematic, however, was Winn’s evidence that he regularly gave information
    to the police.  In particular, he estimated that he had given Detective George
    Snider between fifty to one hundred pieces of information.  Since Snider
    was one of the officers involved in the “gun-in-the-lake” incident, in which
    police officers disposed of a gun Jack Trudel acquired after Sauvé and Trudel
    were convicted, his credibility was challenged, which also increased concerns
    about Winn’s credibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[293]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Winn
    was unmasked as a police informant in 1991 while he was incarcerated. He
    was then placed in protective custody.  He subsequently became part of the
    Witness Protection Programme, during the course of which he gave Snider significant
    additional information.  He told the jury that, as a result of this information,
    the criminal known as the “Flying Bandit” was arrested, convicted, and sentenced
    to twenty years and that a Mr. Craig was “convicted on a bunch of offences
    and got I think eight years”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[294]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence did not object to these aspects of Winn’s evidence during his examination-in-chief.
    Instead, Stewart’s counsel cross-examined Winn in an attempt to show that,
    although he was an informant, he was not a witness against the individuals
    about whom he had provided information.  The objective was to prevent the
    jury from drawing an inference that Winn’s information had been accepted
    as credible in other criminal trials by demonstrating that he had not testified
    at those trials.  When this line of questioning was perceived to exacerbate
    the problem, Stewart’s counsel sought mid-trial <i>Vetrovec</i> and oath-helping
    instructions to the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[295]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Vetrovec</i><i> </i>instruction
    is dealt with separately in these reasons.  On the question of oath-helping,
    the trial judge told the jury:</p>
  <p>To make another point just in passing I would also like to point out to
    you that irrespective of what you find in relation to Mr. Winn’s other informa­tion
    to the police where he has given information to the police in other situations
    you should not reason that because for example Mr. Winn may have told the
    truth in one matter therefore he’s telling the truth in this mat­ter.  </p>
  <p>Such reasoning is not permitted in the circumstances of this case.  You
    determine his credibility on all of the evidence in this case including what
    Mr. Winn said and how Mr. Winn said it and in relation to all of the rest
    of the evidence in the case as well. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[296]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the trial judge did not revisit the issue of oath-helping in his charge to
    the jury, the defence raised no objection. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[297]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the Crown should not have been permitted to elicit evidence that
    information supplied by Winn in other cases had resulted in convictions.  These
    questions were not just intended to inform the jury about Winn’s status as
    a jailhouse informant, nor could these questions be justified as merely “poorly
    worded” or an “error in style”, as argued by the Crown on appeal. Rather,
    the effect of the questions and answers was to suggest that, since Winn’s
    information was credible, truthful and accepted in other cases, so it must
    be credible in this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[298]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether
    a judge or jury in another case accepted Winn’s information as credible was
    irrelevant to the credibility of his information in this case.  It was inadmissible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[299]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown argued that the prejudice resulting from the Crown’s improper questioning
    was fully ameliorated by the trial judge’s mid-trial caution.  In our view,
    it was not.  The jury should have been told explicitly to ignore this evidence.  Furthermore,
    the issue should have been specifically revisited in the charge to the jury. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[300]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[301]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the cumulative effect of certain conduct by the trial
    judge created a reasonable apprehension of bias and that the trial judge
    erred in failing to recuse himself when asked to do so. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[302]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree that it would have been preferable had the trial judge not engaged
    in at least some of the conduct about which the appellants complain.  However,
    on the facts of this case, in our view, the cumulative effect of the impugned
    conduct does not rise to the level necessary to establish a reasonable apprehension
    of bias.  We accordingly conclude that the trial judge made no error in failing
    to recuse himself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[303]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants rely on three incidents in support of their position.  They submit
    that, at least when considered cumulatively, the trial judge’s conduct in
    these incidents gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[304]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first two incidents on which the appellants rely concern the trial judge’s
    conduct in respect of <i>R. v. Sauvé and Trudel</i>, <i>supra</i>.
     The first incident involved the trial judge’s comments to the jury immediately
    after they delivered their guilty verdicts.  During fairly standard remarks
    thanking the jury for their service, the trial judge said the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Members of the jury, we have heard your verdict
    and after fifteen months you do not have to listen to anyone with any more
    words for you or from anyone.  You’ve spoken as judges and triers of the
    facts and you’ve spoken well and clearly.  <u>Your verdict is more than a
    reasonable one based on all of the evidence.</u>  You took an oath to well
    and truly try the case and you have done that. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[305]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants’ concern is the highlighted sentence, which they say could only
    be perceived as expressing approval of the verdict.  While the appellants
    acknowledge that such a comment may not be unusual in the ordinary course,
    they submit that it was problematic in this case for two reasons:  first,
    because of certain other events that occurred following the Sauvé and Trudel
    convictions (we will discuss these events, below); and second, because, in
    addition to conducting the Sauvé and Trudel trial, the same trial judge was
    assigned to preside over the appellants’
    trial relating to the same murders.  Viewed in this context, the appellants
    submit that the trial judge’s approval of the Sauvé and Trudel verdicts creates
    a reasonable apprehension of bias.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[306]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second incident on which the appellants rely is a reception hosted by the
    trial judge at his home following the Sauvé and Trudel trial. Crown counsel,
    court staff, and the jury attended the reception; defence counsel were invited
    but did not attend.  The same prosecution team conducted both cases. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[307]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    the evidence filed on a subsequent recusal application indicated that some
    family members of one of the appellants understood the reception at the trial
    judge’s home was in the nature of a victory party.  The appellants submit
    that, particularly when viewed in the light of these facts, the Sauvé and
    Trudel post-trial reception gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[308]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third incident on which the appellants rely occurred during the course of
    the appellants’ trial. On September 27, 1997, while pre-trial motions were
    ongoing, the trial judge and his wife attended a charity event at the Ottawa
    Congress Centre and sat at a table with Crown counsel, their spouses, and
    Davidson, one of the police officers involved in this case, and his spouse.  The
    evidence filed on the recusal application arising from this incident established
    that the trial judge’s seating arrangements had not been made in advance
    and were a matter of chance. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[309]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the evidence also established that Davidson spoke to the trial judge privately
    on behalf of himself and Crown counsel and said they did not wish to compromise
    the trial judge or the case.  He accordingly told the trial judge they would
    be willing to find alternate seating if the trial judge wished and would
    understand if the trial judge wanted to leave the table.  The trial judge
    responded that he did not think such steps would be necessary as there were
    many people from the court all around the table. The evidence also indicated
    that the trial judge and his wife left the table part way through the event.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[310]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants say that the egregious aspect of this incident is the fact that
    the trial judge continued to sit at the table with Crown counsel and Davidson
    after it was pointed out to him that there was a concern about compromising
    the case.  They contend that, when viewed in the context of the previous
    events and the circumstances the appellants were facing, the cumulative effect
    of these three incidents gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[311]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants filed their first of two applications requesting that the trial
    judge recuse himself on November 25, 1996 after they learned that he had
    been assigned as the trial judge for this trial.  They relied on two basic
    grounds in support of their motion: first, the trial judge would be required
    to revisit rulings he had made in <i>R. v. Sauvé and Trudel</i>, and second,
    the trail judge’s expression of agreement with the verdict in <i>R. v. Sauvé and
    Trudel</i> and the barbeque for the jury and Crown counsel hosted by the
    trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[312]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge dismissed the first recusal application in written reasons dated
    January 14, 1997.  The trial judge relied on the fact that he had written
    the comments he made to the jury before he knew the verdict. In his reasons,
    he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In thanking the jury for their verdict, the court
    said their verdict was “more than reasonable,” and reminded them of their
    oath to “well and it truly try the case.”  <u>That thank you was written
    in advance of knowing the jury’s verdict,</u> and the phrase more than reasonable
    was substituted for the word reasonable <i>simpliciter </i>lest it appear
    to the jury after 15 months that the court was damning its verdict with faint
    praise.  The court would have used precisely the same expression had the
    jury acquitted.  In my view such information in the hands of a reasonable
    person would assuage fears of bias. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[313]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning
    the barbeque held at his home, the trial judge noted the evidence indicating
    a concern that the gathering was a victory party.  He said, “A reasonable
    person could have understood this to be another thank-you”.  In addition,
    he noted that when the invitations were sent, the jury was reminded about
    the <i>Criminal Code</i> provisions regarding jury deliberations.  He said: “It
    is an odd victory party that forecloses from the victors the possibility
    of talking about the game.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[314]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge noted that in his view, it would have been appropriate for
    defence counsel to attend. He said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>All counsel were deserving of the court’s thanks
    as well as the jury and the staff. Everyone’s job was finished.  It was that
    experience which was shared.  The result was irrelevant in that context.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[315]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants brought a second recusal application on January 5, 1998.  The
    basis for the application was the September 27, 1997 Ottawa Congress Centre
    event.  While acknowledging that there had been no discussion of the trial
    at the table, the appellants argued that, at least by this point, there had
    been a continuum of conduct on the part of the trial judge that raised a
    reasonable apprehension of bias. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[316]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge dismissed the second recusal application in written reasons delivered
    on January 9, 1998.  In his reasons, the trial judge provided additional
    facts about the gathering at his home; how he came to be at the Ottawa Congress
    Centre event; the fortuity of the seating arrangements; and the absence of
    discussion about the case at the table.  Ultimately, he said the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Judge (if I may move to the third person) was
    there because he thought that was his seat and that of his wife. If he had
    been prudent he would have moved his seat.  But such failure to be practical
    and wise does not constitute a reasonable apprehension of bias in the particular
    circumstances of this case.  The reasonable observer, fully informed, would
    not go away thinking, to use the words of Lord Denning:  “The judge was biased”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[317]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the appellants that the trial judge’s conduct in holding the Sauvé and
    Trudel post-trial reception was ill-advised and that it would have been preferable
    had the trial judge left the table at which he was seated at the outset of
    the Ottawa Congress Centre event.  However, we are not satisfied that the
    cumulative effect of the conduct about which the appellants complain rises
    to the level necessary to establish a reasonable apprehension of bias. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[318]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    test for assessing a reasonable apprehension of bias claim is whether an
    informed person, viewing the manner realistically and practically and having
    thought the matter through, would think that the decision-maker would not
    decide the matter fairly. The test requires a two-part analysis of objectivity:
    the person considering the alleged bias must be reasonable and invested with
    knowledge of all of the relevant circumstances, including judicial traditions
    of integrity and impartiality, and the apprehension of bias itself must be
    reasonable based on what is observed:  see <i>R. v. S.(R.D.)</i> (1997),
    118 C.C.C. (3d) 353 (S.C.C.); <i>Committee for Justice and Liberty v. National
    Energy Board</i> (1976), [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369; <i>R. v. Gushman</i>, [1994]
    O.J. No. 813 (Gen. Div.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[319]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    concept of judicial impartiality requires that the trial judge approach the
    case with an open mind, meaning that he or she is open to persuasion.  As
    the Supreme Court of Canada said in <i>R. v. S.(R.D.)</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at para. 35, adopting the words of the Canadian Judicial Council in <i>Commentaries
    on Judicial Conduct</i> (Cowansville, Qc.: Editions Yvon Blais, 1991) at
    12, “True impartiality does not require that the judge have no sympathies
    or opinions; it requires that the judge nevertheless be free to entertain
    and act upon different points of view with an open mind.”  In addition, in <i>R.
    v. S.(R.D.)</i>, at para. 117, the Supreme Court noted:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Courts have rightly recognized that there is a
    presumption that judges will carry out their oath of office.  This is one
    of the reasons why the threshold for a successful allegation of perceived
    judicial bias is high.  However, despite this high threshold, the presumption
    can be displaced with “cogent evidence” that demonstrates that something
    the judge has done gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. [Citations
    omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[320]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning
    the trial judge’s remarks to the Sauvé and Trudel jury, in our view, it would
    be apparent to a reasonable observer that, even if the trial judge’s comments
    are interpreted as in some sense endorsing that jury’s verdicts, his comments
    were premised explicitly on the evidence that was presented at that trial.  In
    our view, that fact alone is sufficient to negate the suggestion of a reasonable
    apprehension of bias in relation to <i>this</i> case.  In particular, the
    fact that the verdicts at the first trial were “more than a reasonable one
    based on all of the evidence”
    did not imply that the same verdicts would follow at this trial, at which
    the evidence was not identical. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[321]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, in our opinion, the trial judge’s comments to the Sauvé and Trudel
    jury went no further than addressing the reasonableness of the verdict.  Put
    another way, the trial judge did nothing more than confirm that the jury
    could properly reach the verdicts based on all of the evidence.  Assessed
    from the perspective of a fully informed and reasonable observer, in our
    view, the trial judge’s comments do not imply that he would necessarily have
    reached the same verdicts as the jury in the Sauvé and Trudel trial.  For
    this reason as well, his comments do not raise a reasonable apprehension
    of bias in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[322]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the reception held by the trial judge following the Sauvé and Trudel
    trial, we note that he did not have the benefit of this court’s decision
    in <i>R. v. Bjellebo</i>, [2003] O.J. No. 3946 (C.A.), in which this court
    stated, at para. 16, “such a practice seems … to be ill-advised.” In that
    case, the reception was held before the accused was sentenced and the issue
    of a reasonable apprehension of bias was raised as part of an appeal from
    the sentence that was eventually imposed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[323]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    its reasons for dismissing the sentence appeal in <i>R. v. Bjellebo</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at para. 16, this court noted that the risk inherent in holding a post conviction
    reception was that “a convicted accused might regard it as an inappropriate
    celebration of his condemnation.” However, the court went on to note that
    defence counsel attended without objection, and held that, on the facts of
    that case, the reception did not give rise to a reasonable apprehension of
    bias.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[324]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Sauvé and Trudel reception was held following an unusually lengthy trial.  While
    defence counsel did not attend the reception, they were invited. Although
    hosting such an event is to be avoided in the future, we consider it likely
    that a fully informed and reasonable observer would view the reception as
    no more than an act of good will on the part of the trial judge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[325]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    we have said, the trial judge’s comments to the Sauvé and Trudel jury following
    delivery of the verdicts do not give rise to a reasonable apprehension of
    bias. Apart from his comments thanking the Sauvé and Trudel jury, there was
    no suggestion that the trial judge’s conduct of the Sauvé and Trudel trial
    was other than impartial. Given all of these circumstances, in our view,
    a fully informed and reasonable observer would not conclude that holding
    the Sauvé and Trudel post-trial reception created a reasonable apprehension
    of bias on the part of the trial judge in relation to this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[326]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning
    the trial judge’s attendance at the Ottawa Congress Centre event, as the
    trial judge himself recognized in his ruling, it would have been preferable
    had he left the table at which he was seated at the outset of the event or
    at least as soon as the issue of the seating arrangements was brought to
    his attention by the police officer.  That said, we note that this was a
    public gathering and that the trial judge’s seating was not arranged in advance. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[327]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    reality of today’s society is such that judges and lawyers involved in an
    ongoing case can find themselves in each other’s company through a variety
    of circumstances. Such circumstances include continuing education programs
    at which they are speakers, bar association events, as well as ordinary social
    functions.  It would be a clear breach of judicial and professional ethics
    for a judge and a lawyer to discuss the case in these circumstances.  There
    was no suggestion that such a breach occurred in this instance and, indeed,
    the appellants conceded as much on the recusal application. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[330]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the Crown’s opening and closing addresses were improper,
    inflammatory, and that they rendered the trial unfair.  Appellants’ trial
    counsel objected to both addresses but the trial judge refused to grant a
    mistrial or provide the jury with a corrective instruction. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[331]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown’s opening address was undoubtedly influenced by the protracted pre-trial
    motions that included an attempt by the appellants to have the charges stayed
    as an abuse of process.  The Crown’s opening statement, delivered over a
    two-hour period on October 5, 1998, demeaned the defence by using phrases
    such as:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I’m confident that the glaring spotlight of guilt
    will be shining on Richard Mallory and Robert Stewart, leaving no shadows
    of doubt to crawl behind, no dark corners to hide from the scrutiny of the
    truth. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I, for one, intend to call the defence lawyers “my
    friend” from time to time and I guess we’ll see if it goes both ways. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>Crown counsel told the jury that the defence would invite them </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>to take the easy way out, to not perform your sworn
    duty which is to listen, watch, weigh all of the evidence of all of the witnesses,
    assess it unemotionally, and make a determination as to whether or not any
    of them merit your finding of honest, credible truthfulness. … Don’t be seduced
    by the easy way out that the defence will offer to you. Don’t be convinced
    to look away from the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[332]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants also claim the Crown engaged in pre-emptive argument and rehabilitation
    of witnesses, especially with respect to Gaudreault, and, as we have already
    noted, anticipating the defence attack upon the integrity of the investigation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[333]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    morning following the Crown’s opening address, defence counsel for both appellants
    submitted that the Crown’s opening was improper and announced their intention
    to move for a mistrial.  They proposed that the defence be given an opportunity
    to obtain a transcript of the Crown’s opening.  The trial judge refused to
    grant an adjournment, but left it to the defence to bring an application
    for a mistrial once they had the transcripts.  Counsel for Stewart elected
    to open and regrettably sunk to the level of the Crown in the style and content
    of her remarks.  Counsel for Mallory did not make an opening address.  Almost
    three weeks later, with transcripts in hand, defence counsel for the appellants
    renewed the motion for a mistrial.  The trial judge dismissed this motion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[334]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown’s closing address, delivered over a five-day period, from January 10,
    2000 to January 14, 2000, included controversial phrases and imagery that
    demeaned the defence position by suggesting that it was nothing more that
    an evasion of the truth designed to divert the jury from its sworn duty.  Among
    the many objectionable passages cited by the appellants are the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>We listened to [defence counsel] make their arguments
    to you, and as charming and able and articulate and even passionate and skilled
    as they are, as beguiling an argument can be, neither of them is a magician.  Based
    on the evidence that you’ve heard in this case their clients are guilty and
    regrettably for counsel there’s nothing they can do about that simple fact.  It
    doesn’t matter how many times they call witnesses liars and evidence lies,
    they are still not magicians.  There is too much evidence that they are asking
    you to just put aside and ignore.  I’ve yet to meet anyone who can convince
    twelve reasonable people that black is white and white is black, and neither
    [defence counsel] is that person despite all the other obvious skills that
    they possess. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>When you consider what the defence has ultimately
    offered you, I would ask you to bear in mind this description of the octopus,
    I didn’t write it, it’s an old prosecutor’s standby, a prosecutor’s old standby,
    we’ll go that way, which comes from Victor Hugo and he writes: “The octopus
    is an animal that doesn’t have a beak to fight with like a bird, and it doesn’t
    have claws like a lion and no teeth like an alligator.  All it has is an
    ink bag.  When the octopus is attacked what it does is it releases a dark
    fluid into the waters making them dark and murky, enabling the octopus to
    escape in the darkness.”  I would ask you whether there is any similarity
    between that line of defence and the one you’ve observed in this courtroom.  Has
    the defence shown you any real, valid, legitimate defence based on the evidence
    or have they simply approached this like the octopus and tried to obscure
    things by making everything around them dark, trying to escape back into
    the darkness?  Is this not a defence which relies on obfuscation, of skewering
    the issues, keeping their fingers crossed that maybe you weren’t too insulted
    by what Mr. Mallory tried to fly by from the witness stand?  What was that
    that Mr. Mallory gave you? </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This trial for the Crown is a question of demonstrating
    to you beyond a reasonable doubt the factual and legal truths behind the
    charges that are facing the accused.  We bear that legal burden throughout
    this trial and all trials.  Let us be clear, however, that that is not what
    it is about for the defence in this trial or any trial and they’ve already
    told you that.  The trial for the defence is not about demonstrating the
    truth, it is about raising a reasonable doubt.  Raising a reasonable doubt
    is the sole objective of the defence and it is their only obligation.  As
    they said, they don’t have to demonstrate anything.  In order to raise a
    reasonable doubt they’ve tried to direct your attention from the evident
    into speculation.  When we clear the waters, which the defence have tried
    to muddy… </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There’s another standard prosecutorial analogy
    for this defence approach that you observed and it goes like this: The defence
    need your faculties to be limited as though you were twelve blindfolded people
    trying to figure out what an elephant is using only your sense of touch.
    One person touching the elephant’s trunk might think it’s a snake, someone
    else feeling the leg might think “Well this is a tree.” That’s what I’m dealing
    with.  Another person feeling the tail might think it’s a rope. If the defence
    can prevent you from seeing the whole animal then you may well fail to reach
    the right result, you may not identify exactly what you’re looking at. They
    want you to stay blindfolded and focus only on certain details in isolation,
    out of context, and then at the end of it they’re better able to argue and
    convince you that perhaps it is a snake or a tree or a rope, but clearly,
    ladies and gentlemen, given that perspective, they would feel that they’re
    in a better position to say to you that you must have a doubt as to whether
    it’s an elephant.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The very suggestion that Denis Gaudreault fabricated
    his evidence and conscripted Jamie Declare and Jamie’s mom and Rhonda and
    Garrett Nelson, Gaudreault’s own mother, Sylvie and Richard Gravell, to corroborate
    him, that suggestion that Gaudreault could do that speaks more loudly of
    the desperation in the defence position than anything I could have conceived
    of on my own.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[335]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the Crown’s submissions, defence counsel objected to the rhetorical excesses
    in the Crown’s closing.  Defence counsel asked for a mistrial, a corrective
    instruction, or an opportunity to reply (the defence had called evidence
    and the Crown had the last word before the jury).  The trial judge refused
    to declare a mistrial and declined to allow a right to reply.  With respect
    to providing corrective instructions, the trial judge said he would first
    have to read the written materials.  The trial judge began his charge to
    the jury and in the end failed to provide any corrective instruction on this
    issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[336]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown’s role in the prosecution of criminal offences has long been recognized
    as quasi-ministerial. Success for the Crown is not measured in wins and losses.  We
    repeat here the words of Rand J. in <i>R. v. Boucher</i>,<i> supra</i>,<i> </i>at
    270, “The role of the prosecutor excludes any notion of wining or losing;
    his function is a matter of public duty … It is to be efficiently performed
    with an ingrained sense of the dignity, the seriousness and the justness
    of judicial proceedings.” Moreover, as Kerwin C.J. noted in <i>R. v. Boucher</i> at
    265, the Crown’s role is to assist the jury</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>but he exceeds that duty when he expresses by inflammatory
    or vindictive language his own personal opinion that the accused is guilty,
    or when he expresses by inflammatory or vindictive language his own personal
    opinion that the accused is guilty, or when his remarks tend to leave the
    jury an impression that the investigation made by the Crown is such that
    they should find the accused guilty. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[337]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
    recently, the Supreme Court acknowledged in <i>R. v. Cook</i> (1997), 114
    C.C.C. (3d) 481 at para. 21 (S.C.C.), rev’g (1996), 107 C.C.C. (3d) 334 (N.B.C.A.),
    that while “it is without question that the Crown performs a special function
    in ensuring that justice is served and cannot adopt a purely adversarial
    role towards the defence” it is also “well recognized that the adversarial
    process is an important part of our judicial system and an accepted tool
    in our search for the truth”.  Within the adversarial process the Crown is
    permitted to act as a strong advocate.  Within the bounds set out in <i>R.
    v. Boucher</i>, <i>supra</i>, “the Crown must be allowed to perform the function
    with which it has been entrusted”: <i>R. v. Cook, supra, </i>at para. 21.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[338]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is well established that the opening address is not the appropriate forum
    for argument, invective, or opinion.  The Crown should use the opening address
    to introduce the parties, explain the process, and provide a general overview
    of the evidence that the Crown anticipates calling in support of its case:
    see <i>R. v. Griffin</i>, [1993] O.J. No. 2573 at paras. 25-31 (Gen. Div.); <i>R.
    v. Porter</i>, [1992] O.J. No. 2931 (Gen. Div.); <i>R. v. Sun</i>, [2002]
    O.J. No. 2166 (S.C.J.); <i>R. v. White</i>, [1997] O.J. No. 5899 (Gen. Div.).  Simply
    put, “the Crown’s opening address should be impartial and fair, a brief outline
    of the evidence that the Crown intends to call”:  <i>R. v. Griffin </i>at
    para. 31.  At the opening of the trial the rules constraining the Crown “should
    apply with even more vigour” than at the closing when by then the jurors
    have heard and seen all about the case: <i>R. v. Griffin </i>at para. 23.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[339]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to closing addresses, the Crown is afforded greater latitude:  see <i>R.
    v. Baltrusaitis </i>(2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 161 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  While Crown counsel must at all times conduct themselves with dignity
    and fairness, they are entitled to advance their position forcefully when
    making closing submissions. In <i>R. v. Daly </i>(1992), 57 O.A.C. 70 at
    76 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), this court observed:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A closing address is an exercise in advocacy.  It
    is the culmination of a hard fought adversarial proceeding.  Crown counsel,
    like any other advocate, is entitled to advance his or her position forcefully
    and effectively.  Juries expect that both counsel will present their positions
    in that manner and no doubt expect and accept a degree of rhetorical passion
    in that presentation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[340]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    closing address is the proper forum for argument and the Crown is certainly
    entitled to argue its case forcefully.  The Crown should not, however, engage
    in inflammatory rhetoric, demeaning commentary or sarcasm, or legally impermissible
    submissions that effectively undermine a requisite degree of fairness:  see <i>R.
    v. Grover </i>(1991), 67 C.C.C. (3d) 576 (S.C.C.), rev’g (1990), 56 C.C.C.
    (3d) 532 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. Romeo </i>(1991), 62 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.),

    96 C.C.C. (3d) 431 (Ont. C.A.), aff’d (1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 383 (S.C.C.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[341]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    a protracted and hard fought trial such as this, one with months of pre-trial
    proceedings and allegations of abuse of process, it may be difficult for
    the Crown to resist rhetorical excess.  But resist it must, even when provoked
    by what Crown counsel perceives to be obstructive and truculent behaviour
    by the defence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[342]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the opening address of Crown counsel called for corrective action
    by the trial judge.  Crown counsel was not content to follow the orthodox
    path and open by simply outlining for the benefit of the jury the case she
    intended to present.  Regrettably, Crown counsel demeaned the position of
    the defence and the role of defence counsel, engaged in pre-emptive argument,
    undermined the presumption of innocence, and expressed her personal opinion
    as to the guilt of the appellants.  Phrases such as “the glaring spotlight
    of guilt” and the reference to there being “no shadows of doubt to crawl
    behind, no dark corners to hide from the scrutiny of truth”, and the suggestion
    that the defence would try to “seduce” the jury to ignore the evidence were
    plainly inappropriate and set an unfortunate tone for the balance of the
    trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[343]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not say that the trial judge necessarily erred by failing to declare a
    mistrial after the Crown opening.  We agree with the Crown that it was within
    the discretion of the trial judge to conclude that the comments were not
    so egregious as to require a mistrial.  On the other hand, it is our view
    that some corrective action was called for.  The trial judge should, at a
    minimum, have admonished the overly aggressive trial Crown for violating
    the <i>R. v. </i><i>Boucher</i>, <i>supra</i>, standard and instructed the
    jury to ignore the objectionable passages of the Crown’s opening address.  As
    we have already indicated, by anticipating and attempting to pre-empt the
    attack on the integrity of the investigation, the Crown set the trial of
    that issue off on the wrong course.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[344]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her closing address the Crown again demeaned and denigrated the role of defence
    counsel, and, with considerable rhetorical flourish, portrayed the defence
    as deceptive and obstructionist, intent upon diverting the jury’s attention
    from the truth. While it is not improper for the Crown to identify for the
    benefit of the jury defence arguments inviting speculation, Crown counsel’s
    comments in this case were not in keeping with the standard outlined in <i>R.
    v. </i><i>Boucher</i>, <i>supra</i>.<i> </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[345]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    recognize that there are many cases involving similar remarks, uncorrected
    by the trial judge, that have been found by this and other courts not to
    be fatal:  see e.g. <i>R. v. Baltrusaitis</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>R. v. Clark </i>(2004),
    69 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.); <i>R. v. Daly</i>, <i>supra</i>.  In view of the
    numerous other errors to which we have referred, it is not necessary for
    us to pronounce definitively upon the effect of the Crown’s rhetorical excesses.  Suffice
    it to say that we view the passages we have quoted from the Crown’s opening
    and closing to have been inappropriate, and that in our view, at a minimum,  the
    trial judge should have given a corrective instruction to redress the imbalance
    it created and to alleviate the risk that the jury might be improperly influenced. </p>

    issues may be significant at a new trial, our role is not to retry the case.  Most
    of the grounds raised by Stewart, including the allegation of inadequate
    assistance of counsel, are not errors of a nature that would permit an appellate
    court to grant Stewart the remedy he seeks, namely an acquittal.  It is accordingly

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[350]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1993, the police asked Beland, who was married to Stewart, whether she drove
    Gaudreault home on the night of the murders in January 1990.  In her first
    statement to the police, Beland said, “I never drove him home” and, further,
    that she could not remember ever being in a car with Gaudreault.  In subsequent
    statements to the police, Beland maintained simply that she could not remember
    driving Gaudreault home. At the 1994 preliminary inquiry, when asked whether
    she drove Gaudreault home, she replied: “no, not that I recall.”  At the
    Sauvé and Trudel trial, in response to the same question, Beland said, “I
    don’t think so, but I’m not 100% sure.”  At this trial, Beland testified

    relies on a sworn videotaped statement Beland gave to <i>amicus curiae </i>on
    March 3, 2005 and on her affidavit of July 6, 2005.  In that material, Beland
    explains that her earlier inability to remember whether she drove Gaudreault

    information that she now has about the night of the murders was given to
    her by Stewart in a taped conversation.  That conversation took place after
    Beland completed her evidence at the trial.  It is a conversation the Crown
    characterizes as witness tampering. In that conversation, Stewart told Beland
    that Gaudreault testified that all four accused were in the Beland/Stewart
    home at the same time and that all four were
    “running like a little boy all happy … like a chicken with his head cut off”.
    In addition, Stewart reminded Beland that the murders occurred on a school

    162:  “<span class=loose1><span lang=EN
style='color:black;'>The test for ordering an acquittal based on fresh evidence
    is high; the evidence must be
    ‘clearly decisive’ of innocence.  See <i>R. v. Stolar</i>, [1988] 1 S.C.R.
    480.” </span></span><span
class=loose1><span lang=EN style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black;'> </span></span>If accepted as true by the trier of fact, Beland’s
    fresh evidence would certainly support the appellants’ case.  However, taking
    into account the various versions Beland has given in the past and the other
    evidence that was adduced at trial, we are not persuaded that Beland’s new
    version is “clearly decisive” of innocence.  It follows that in the circumstances
    of this appeal, admitting the fresh evidence would result in a new trial,
    not an acquittal.  As we are of the view that a new trial is necessary based
    on other grounds of appeal, we do not need to decide the application to admit
    the fresh evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[357]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not consider it necessary to decide which grounds of appeal, standing
    alone, would require a new trial.  In view of the number and gravity of the
    errors we have found, we see no basis for applying the proviso.  The appeals
    against conviction must be allowed, the convictions set aside, and a new
    trial ordered. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[358]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    wish to express our thanks to all participants in this appeal for their assistance
    in organizing an unusually lengthy and complex record and in presenting the
    court with very helpful written and oral submissions.</p>
