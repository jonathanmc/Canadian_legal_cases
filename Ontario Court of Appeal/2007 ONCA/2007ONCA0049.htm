    the claim of York Condominium Corporation #382 (“York”) against the City
    of Toronto (the “City”) for an alleged act of negligence that took place
    over 15 years ago, but which it pleads that it only discovered in May 2004,
    barred under the <i>Limitations Act, 2002</i>, S.O. 2002, c. 24, Sched. B
    (the “Act”)?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Previously,
    time for bringing a claim for general negligence did not begin to run until
    the claimant knew or ought to have known that he or she had a claim.  This
    was known as “the discoverability rule”.  See
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Kamloops</i><i> (City) v. Nielson</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 2; <i>Central Trust
    Co. v. Rafuse</i>, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 147; <i>Peixeiro</i><i> v. Haberman</i> (1995),
    25 O.R. (3d) 1 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), aff’d [1997] 3 S.C.R. 549.  The rule subjected a defendant to potential
    liability indefinitely.  The current Act seeks to balance the right of claimants
    to sue with the right of defendants to have some certainty and finality in
    managing their affairs.  Subject to certain exceptions that are not relevant
    to this appeal, the Act provides for a fifteen-year ultimate limitation period
    dating from the act or omission giving rise to a claim.  Regard for this
    provision in isolation would automatically bar
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    York’s claim.  However, the transition provision in s. 24(5) Rule 1 states: “If
    the claim was not discovered before [January 1, 2004], the Act applies as
    if the act or omission had taken place on [January 1, 2004].”  As I would
    interpret this transition provision, if a claim is not discovered until after
    January 1, 2004, but the act or omission took place before that date, the
    ultimate limitation period of fifteen years starts to run as if the act or
    omission had taken place on January 1, 2004 and

    York discovered that the condominium building’s demising walls were not fire-rated
    in accordance with the Building Code.  It brought an action in June 2005
    against the condominium developer, Jay-M Holdings Limited, and the City,
    alleging the former was negligent in its construction of the building and
    the latter was negligent in its inspection of the building.  The parties
    agree that the last act by the City with respect to its alleged negligence
    took place in February 1978.</p>

    York brought its claim within this time limit.  However, the Act also contains
    a 15-year ultimate limitation period.  Section 15 of the Act provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1) Even if the limitation period established by
    any other section of this Act in respect of a claim has not expired, no proceeding
    shall be commenced in respect of the claim after the expiry of a limitation
    period established by this section.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) No proceeding shall be commenced in respect

    brought although the basic limitation period of two years from the date of
    discovery had not expired. </p>

    prevailing approach to statutory interpretation is that “the words of an
    Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary
    sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and
    the intention of Parliament.”  See Elmer A. Driedger, <i>The </i><i>Construction
    of Statutes</i>,<i> </i>2<sup>nd</sup> ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1983)
    at 87.  This approach has been widely endorsed by the Supreme Court.  See <i>Bell
    ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559 at para. 26.
    The interpretive factors set out by Driedger,<i> </i>need not be canvassed
    separately in every case:

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    different interpretations of a provision by counsel engaged in litigation
    are not an appropriate starting point from which to conclude that legislation
    is ambiguous.  <i>Bell ExpressVu, supra,</i> at paras. 29- 30.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    ordinary meaning of legislation is “the natural meaning which appears when
    the provision is simply read through”.  See Ruth Sullivan, <i>Sullivan and
    Driedger on the Construction of Statutes</i>, 4<sup>th</sup> ed. (Markham,
    Ont.: Butterworths
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    , 2002) at 21, where Sullivan quotes Gonthier J. from <i>Canadian Pacific
    Airlines v. Canadian Air Line Pilots Assn.</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 724 at 735.  Having
    determined the ordinary meaning, the court must go on to consider the context
    of the provision, the purpose and scheme of the legislation as well as the
    consequences of adopting the ordinary meaning and any other relevant indicators
    of legislative meaning.  If, after undertaking this analysis, the words of
    the provision are reasonably capable of more than one meaning, a real ambiguity
    exists.  <i>Bell ExpressVu, supra,</i> at paras 29- 30. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court must adopt an interpretation that best fulfills the objects of the
    legislation.  Having regard to this broader context, the court may modify
    or reject the application of the presumption that favours an interpretation
    in accordance with the ordinary meaning.  However, the interpretation adopted
    must be plausible in the sense that it is one that the words are reasonably
    capable of bearing.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    statute, should, if possible, be construed so as to avoid any inconsistency
    between its different provisions.  One way of reconciling an inconsistency
    is through the “implied exception” rule of statutory interpretation, which
    holds that a special provision prevails over a more general provision.  See
    Ruth Sullivan, <i>Sullivan and Driedger on the Construction of Statutes</i>,
    4<sup>th</sup> ed. (Markham, Ont.: Butterworths, 2002) at 273.</p>

      Case</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motions judge erred in concluding that simply because counsel had put forward
    two conflicting interpretations respecting the interpretation of the transitional
    provisions, s. 24(5) was ambiguous when viewed alongside the provisions of
    s. 15:
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Bell</i><i> Expressvu, supra. </i> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  To
    determine whether the legislation should be given its ordinary meaning, a
    contextual and purposive approach is required.  The same approach is used
    to resolve a true ambiguity in legislation.  While the motions judge undertook
    a contextual and purposive analysis, I conclude that his analysis was not
    correct.  Rather, the adoption of a contextual and purposive approach leads
    me to conclude that the transition provisions postpone the starting date
    for the running of the ultimate limitation period to January 1, 2004. </p>

    the current Act came into force, the calculation of the fifteen-year ultimate

    York did not discover its claim until after the effective date of the Act

    1 provides that, “If the claim was not discovered before the effective date,
    this Act applies as if the act or omission had taken place on the effective
    date.”  The City submits that Rule 1 ought to mean that, if the claim was
    not discovered before the effective date, the Act applies.  This interpretation
    gives no meaning to the concluding words of Rule 1, “as if the act or omission

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is certainly arguable that s. 15(1) is not in harmony with the transitional
    provision of s. 24(5) Rule 1.  Again, section 15(1) states: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Even if the limitation period established by any
    other section of this Act in respect of a claim has not expired, no proceeding
    shall be commenced in respect of the claim after the expiry of a limitation

  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>However, in keeping with the rule
    that, if possible, disharmony should be avoided, I would hold that disharmony
    can be avoided by treating s. 24(5) as a special provision that applies to
    the limited number of transitional situations and by treating s. 15(1) as
    a general provision.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    despite s. 15, it cannot be read in the manner
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    York submits.  In support of its position, the City points to other sections
    of the Act where s. 15 is specifically made subject to another section.  For
    example, s. 16(4) states that ss. 16 and 17 prevail over anything in s. 15.  However,
    neither of those sections deals with a transitional context.  Section 16
    deals with general situations where there is no limitation period and s.
    17 deals with environmental claims.  These sections apply indefinitely for
    the foreseeable future until the Act is amended.  Section 24(5) is transitory
    and the situations to which it applies will run their course.  There would
    be little point in enacting this transition provision if it were not intended
    to apply to s. 15.  </p>

    the motions judge and this Court were not provided with any scholarly writing
    or educational material concerning the new Act, it does exist and supports
    the position I have taken.  For example, John Lee, counsel for the Ministry

    “Developing a New Uniform Limitations Act: A survey of Canada’s Emerging
    Limitations Regimes” in Melissa Krishna, executive ed., and Jacob Ziegel <i>et

    Lee discussed the meaning of s. 24(5) Rule 1.  Lee’s interpretation of s.
    24(5) Rule 1 is that if a claim is not discovered until after the Act’s effective
    date, but the act or omission took place before the effective date, “for
    purposes of calculating the ultimate limitations period, the period will

    articulates the common-sense proposition that effect should be given to the
    ordinary meaning of a legislative provision unless there is a good reason
    not to do so.  The court is therefore required to consider the purpose and
    scheme of the legislation, the consequences of adopting the ordinary meaning
    and all other relevant indicators of legislative meaning.  In light of these
    additional considerations, the court may adopt an interpretation that modifies
    or rejects the ordinary meaning provided that the words can bear the proposed
    alternative meaning.  The interpretation of the motions judge can be viewed
    as a marked departure from previous limitations act jurisprudence that when
    the provisions of a statute of limitations are in issue, “[they] should be
    liberally construed in favour of the individual whose right to sue for compensation
    is in question.”  <i>Papamonolopoulos v.

    Act is the culmination of several earlier attempts since the late 1960s to
    reform the law of limitations.  In 1969, the Ontario Law Reform Commission
    (OLRC) called for a simplification of the law of limitations in its <i>Report
    of the Ontario Law Reform Commission on Limitation of Actions</i> (Toronto:
    Department of the Attorney General, 1969).  The Attorney General released
    a discussion paper in 1977, comprising a draft bill, which largely borrowed
    from the OLRC report.  See Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General, <i>Discussion
    Paper on Proposed </i>Limitations Act<i> </i>(Toronto: Ministry of the Attorney
    General, 1977).  Much of the draft bill from 1977 was reflected in Bill 160
    (<i>An Act to revise the </i>Limitations Act, 3<sup>rd</sup> Sess., 32<sup>nd</sup> Leg.,
    Ontario), introduced in 1983, which did not proceed beyond first reading.  Bill
    160 would have introduced a knowledge requirement into the law of limitations.  For
    certain actions, s. 10 of the Bill provided that the limitation period would
    not start to run until the plaintiff had knowledge of the identity of the
    defendant and knowledge of sufficient facts to indicate that he had a cause
    of action. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1991, a consultation group produced a paper for the Attorney General on the
    proposed <i>Limitations Act</i>.  See Limitations Act Consultation Group, <i>Recommendations
    for a New Limitations Act: Report of the Limitations Act Consultation Group</i> (Toronto:
    Ministry of the Attorney General, 1991).  The consultation group recommended
    an ultimate limitation period of thirty years and, in exceptional cases,
    ten years.  With respect to when to enact the shorter ultimate limitation
    period, at page 5 the consultation group asked the government to weigh, “the
    availability of evidence to the defendant, the cost of maintaining records,
    and the cost and availability of insurance against the likelihood of meritorious
    claims after ten years”.  Under the heading “Transition” in the consultation
    paper, the following is found:<i></i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The new scheme would apply to any act or omission
    that occurred before the effective date of the new legislation provided that
    the old limitation period had not expired.  This will result in the extension
    of some limitation periods to a maximum of two years and the shortening of
    others to two years if a longer period would otherwise have applied.  </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>Under the heading, “Summary of recommendations
    for a New Limitations Act”, recommendation 27 suggests that where the application
    of the new act would shorten the limitation period that would otherwise apply,
    the limitation period should be the shorter of the limitation period under
    the then existing legislation or two years from the coming into force of
    the new legislation.  No mention is made of the ultimate limitation period
    in that recommendation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    consultation paper led to the introduction of Bill 99 (<i>An Act to revise
    the </i>Limitations Act, 2<sup>nd</sup> Sess., 35<sup>th</sup> Leg.,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario) in 1992.  As recommended in the consultation paper, Bill 99 contained
    a basic two-year limitation period, codification of the discoverability principle
    and a thirty-year limitation period with a shorter ultimate limitation period
    of ten years for some cases.  As with Bill 160, Bill 99 did not go beyond
    first reading.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    next proposed reform came in 2000, with the introduction of Bill 163 (<i>An
    Act to revise the </i>Limitations Act, 1<sup>st</sup> Sess., 37<sup>th</sup> Leg.,
    Ontario), which contained a codification of the discoverability principle
    but which also introduced a general fifteen-year ultimate limitation period.  After
    prorogation of the legislature, Bill 163 was reintroduced in 2001 as Bill
    10 (<i>An Act to revise the </i>Limitations Act, 2<sup>nd</sup> Sess., 37<sup>th</sup> Leg.,
    Ontario) and was later reintroduced in 2002 as Schedule B to Bill 213, the <i>Justice
    Statute Law Amendment Act, 2002</i> (3<sup>rd</sup> Sess., 37<sup>th</sup> Leg.,
    Ontario)<i>. </i> Bill 213 was an omnibus bill that was introduced on November
    26, 2002 and never went to committee for debate.  The Bill went through second
    and third readings with limited debate in the legislature and received Royal
    Assent as the <i>Justice Statute Law Amendment Act, 2002</i>, S.O. 2002,
    c. 24,<i> </i>on December 9.  <b>  </b><i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    explanatory note respecting the ultimate limitation period contained in Bill
    213 simply confirms that the Act establishes an ultimate limitation period
    of fifteen years.  The limitation period runs from the day of the act or
    omission irrespective of when the claim is discovered.  The note adds that
    the ultimate limitation period does not run in certain circumstances.  With
    respect to s. 24, the note says, “[t]he Act contains a number of general
    provisions dealing with technical matters (sections 18 to 24)” and “[d]etailed
    rules are provided for the treatment of claims that arose before the coming
    into force of the new Act (section 24)”.  The explanatory note does not form
    part of the law and, since it does not discuss the effect of the transition
    rules, does not assist in the interpretation of s. 24(5) Rule 1.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    purpose of the Act as a whole is to balance the right to access to justice
    by bringing a lawsuit with the right to certainty and finality in the organization
    of one’s affairs.  The purpose of the ultimate limitation period is to balance
    the concern for plaintiffs with undiscovered causes of action with the need
    to prevent the indefinite postponement of a limitation period and the associated
    costs relating to record-keeping and insurance resulting from continuous
    exposure to liability.  While the motions judge considered the purpose of
    the Act and of the ultimate limitation period, he did not consider the purpose
    of the transitional provisions.  The purpose of transitional provisions in
    general is to provide when a new Act applies and when it does not apply,
    or to provide for how it applies to situations that arose before the coming
    into force of the Act that are affected by its passage.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
    the legislative history of the Act one can deduce that the time chosen for
    the ultimate limitation period, fifteen years, represented a compromise between
    the thirty-year period proposed for most claims and the ten-year period proposed
    for others.  Interestingly, in Hansard, the Attorney General at the time
    the Act was passed also suggested that the fifteen-year period was chosen
    as a compromise, but referred to it as a compromise between ten-year and
    twenty-year periods that exist for ultimate limitation periods in other jurisdictions.  See
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario, Legislative Assembly, <i>Official Report of Debates (Hansard)</i>,
    Vol. 5, No. 65 (2 December 2002) at 1550 (David Young).  The transitional
    provision furthers that compromise approach.  Although the common law rule
    of discoverability is modified by s. 15, section 24(5) operates to mitigate
    the effect of the new legislation on pre-existing but undiscovered claims.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motions judge looked to the interpretation of the ultimate limitation period
    and its relationship to the discoverability principle in the British Columbia<i> Limitation
    Act </i>passed in 1975, and the decision of <i>Armstrong</i> <i>v. West Vancouver
    (District) </i>(2003), 223 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 102 (B.C.C.A.).  That
    case held that the ultimate limitation period of thirty years applied from
    the date the damage occurred.  The ultimate limitation period did not run
    from the date the evidence of the negligence in issue was discovered.  Further,
    in <i>410727 B.C. Ltd. v. Dayhu Investments Ltd. </i>(2004), 241 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>)
    467 (B.C.C.A.), the court confirmed that the ultimate thirty-year limitation
    period began to run from the time that the action accrued, whether or not
    the cause of action was discoverable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motions judge accepted the City’s submission that the same interpretation
    the courts arrived at in <i>Armstrong </i>and <i>Dayhu </i>should be given
    to section 24(5) Rule 1 here.  However, the City’s submission ignores the
    fact that, while the wording of the ultimate limitation provision in s. 15
    of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario’s legislation is similar to the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    British Columbia statute, the wording of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario’s transition provisions in s. 24 is significantly different. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    transition provision in the British Columbia statute, s. 14, provides, that
    if the cause of action arose before the new <i>Limitations Act</i> comes
    into force and the limitation period provided under the former legislation
    is longer than the limitation period provided under the new Act, the limitation
    period expires two years after the new Act comes into force or pursuant to
    the limitation period under the former Act, whichever is shorter.  The
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Alberta <i>Limitations Act</i>, R.S.A. 2000 c. L-12, which came into force
    on March 1, 1999, contains a similarly worded transition provision and a
    ten-year ultimate limitation period.  In <i>Bowes v. Edmonton (City)</i> (2005),
    386 A.R. 1 (Q.B.), Clarkson J. concluded that the ultimate limitation period
    was intended to have retrospective effect and, as a result, the plaintiffs’ action
    against the City of Edmonton was statute-barred because the City’s negligent
    act of issuing building permits to the plaintiffs, notwithstanding the geological
    reports it had concerning the instability of the land on which their homes
    were built, occurred more than ten years before the land collapsed in 1999
    (after the  new Act had come into force). <i> </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither
    the British Columbia statute nor the Alberta statute has a transition provision
    that provides, as does s. 24(5) Rule 1, that
    “If the claim was not discovered before the effective date, this Act applies
    as if the act or omission had taken place on the effective date.”  If the
    claim was not discovered before the coming into force of the Act, the Act
    in effect triggers the start of the new fifteen-year ultimate limitation
    period.  Such a provision does not seem to me to do violence to the intention
    of the legislators or to the policy of the Act. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motions judge was also concerned that interpreting the transitional provision
    as submitted by
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    York would lead to an absurd result.  As an example, he stated that a proceeding
    based on an act that occurred in 1978 but discovered in 2003 could not proceed,
    whereas a proceeding based on the same 1978 act discovered in 2018 could
    proceed.  The example given by the motions judge was flawed.  If the 1978
    act was discovered in 2003, the claim was discovered before the effective
    date of the new Act on January 1, 2004, and, pursuant to s. 24(5) Rule 2,
    the limitation period under the former Act would apply.  That limitation
    period would ordinarily be six years.  Thus, the claimant would have until
    2009 to bring a claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the effect of my proposed interpretation is to allow a twenty-seven-year-old
    claim that was not discovered until shortly after the new Act had come into
    force to go forward.  This time frame is within thirty years from the date
    of the act or omission, the ultimate time recommended in the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario consultation paper for most claims, as well as that contained in
    the earlier Bill, and the same time as provided in the B.C. legislation for
    all claims.  It cannot be said to be an absurd result particularly when one
    recalls that, prior to the passage of the new Act, there was unlimited liability
    for as-yet-undiscovered claims (i.e. there was no ultimate limitation period).  In
    moving to a new regime with an ultimate limitations period, s. 24(5) Rule
    1 effectively creates a 15-year transition period for undiscovered claims.  Although
    such a transition provision may be regarded as generous, it is part of the
    Act’s attempt to ensure that, with respect to pre-existing situations, access
    to justice be preserved while limiting liability on a go-forward basis.    </p>
