    have a suspect in a serious crime, usually murder, but they have been unable
    to obtain sufficient evidence against the suspect.  While there are some
    variations, in general, in the Mr. Big scenario police officers posing as
    organized crime figures offer the suspect the opportunity to join their organization.  The
    cost of entry to the organization is that the suspect demonstrate that he
    can be trusted and is capable of carrying out the kind of criminal acts required
    by the organization.  The suspect is persuaded by inducements and other means
    to admit to a serious crime to demonstrate his trust in the organization
    and that he can be counted on to carry out the criminal orders of Mr. Big.  </p>

    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  In this case, in order to gain a job in a criminal organization,
    the appellant told undercover officers that he had killed two men.  While
    the appellant had been a suspect in these two killings, there was almost
    no other credible evidence to connect him to the crimes.  In a pre-trial
    motion, the appellant argued that his statements were inadmissible under
    the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  Kozak J. heard the motion,
    rejected arguments that the statements were inadmissible either under the <i>Charter</i> or
    at common law, and held that the statements were admissible.  </p>

    courts in other provinces and the Supreme Court of Canada have held that
    statements made in the course of the Mr. Big strategy are admissible at common
    law.  Although the statements are invariably induced by promises made by
    persons in authority, the common law voluntariness rules do not apply because
    the suspect does not know the members of the criminal organization are really
    police officers.  Courts have also held that since the suspect is not detained
    when making the statements, the right to silence guaranteed by s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> as
    explained in <i>R. v. Hebert</i> (1990),  57 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) is not
    violated.</p>

    an interesting argument, Mr. Campbell, on behalf of the appellant, argues
    that our understanding of the right against self-incrimination has evolved
    so that physical detention is no longer required to trigger the constitutionally
    protected right to silence.  Accordingly, he submits that the appellant’s
    statements to the police officers were inadmissible under the <i>Charter</i>.  Alternatively,
    he argues that a court has a common law jurisdiction to exclude the statements
    because they are made under circumstances of unreliability or because their
    admission would shock the conscience of the community.  In a separate argument,
    the appellant also argues that the trial judge, Platana J.,<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    case involves the killing of two men approximately one month apart in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Thunder Bay.  In the early morning hours of January 16, 1998, Raymond Greenwood
    was killed in his hotel room.  At the time, the appellant was working as
    a taxi driver.  Aside from what is contained in his statements to the undercover
    police officers, the appellant’s only known connection with the deceased
    is that he picked up a prostitute at the hotel who had been in Mr. Greenwood’s
    hotel room.  The Crown’s theory was that at some point the appellant returned
    to the hotel, entered the deceased’s room, and repeatedly stabbed him to
    death, presumably as part of a robbery. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    police interviewed the appellant on several occasions, initially simply as
    a witness.  However, in the following weeks the police began to view him
    as a suspect and were planning to place him under intermittent surveillance
    and interview him again.  They abandoned this plan when Theodore Keeper was
    killed on February 25, 1998 in a manner very similar to Mr. Greenwood.  While
    there was no circumstantial evidence to connect the appellant with this killing,
    the police believed that both killings were committed by the same person.  Their
    investigation focused on the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    the next several months the police mounted a campaign of overt surveillance
    on the appellant.  They followed him day and night and contacted his associates.  It
    seems that eventually this intense surveillance tapered off.  The police
    had been unable to obtain any incriminating evidence from the appellant.</p>

    a year after the second killing, the appellant entered a drug treatment centre
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    North Bay.  The police placed an undercover officer, Det. Sgt. Sheffer, into
    the facility to befriend the appellant.  Sheffer only remained in the facility
    for a few days.  Five months later, in August 1999, Sheffer renewed his acquaintance
    with the appellant.  Posing as a drifter, Sheffer arranged a “chance” encounter
    with the appellant.  The appellant complained about police officers coming
    to his house and said he would tell Sheffer the whole story some day.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Five
    months later, on January 21, 2000, Sheffer again met the appellant, seemingly
    by chance, and they resumed their relationship.  This time, however, Sheffer
    appeared to be employed and gave the impression that he was involved in illegal
    activities.  On January 24, Sheffer pretended that he had to deliver a mysterious
    parcel to the area of
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Pass
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Lake.  The appellant offered to accompany him.  During the trip, the appellant
    seemed preoccupied with surveillance and Sheffer asked him if there was something
    he should know.  The appellant said that he was a suspect in unsolved homicides
    but he denied that he was involved.  The appellant complained about financial
    problems and Sheffer told him that if a job came up he would keep him in
    mind.  When Sheffer and the appellant returned to Thunder Bay they went to
    a house set up to look like Sheffer’s residence.  By arrangement, a Crime
    Stoppers video that referred to the murders and referred to the appellant
    as the killer was played on the television.  The appellant was angry about
    the “broadcast”, asking how the police could get away with such actions.</p>

line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three
    days later, Sheffer offered to put in a good word for the appellant with
    his boss.  However, he told the appellant that the partners in the organization
    would need something that they could use as trust.  The appellant said that
    he knew something about the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Greenwood homicide; that he had driven a friend to the hotel and found out
    the next day that a murder had occurred.  Sheffer told the appellant that
    the boss was coming to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Thunder Bay and that he would tell the boss what the appellant had told him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    following day, Sheffer picked up the appellant and drove him to a hotel to
    meet the boss. In reality, the boss was another undercover officer, Det.
    Sgt. McIsaac.  McIsaac questioned the appellant about his past and the appellant
    told him about his prior record and similar matters.  When McIsaac appeared
    disinterested in these matters, Sheffer suggested that the appellant tell
    him about the murders.  The appellant repeated the story he had given Sheffer
    the day before.  McIsaac pointed out that the appellant could just be repeating
    things he had read in the newspapers.  The appellant then “put his hands
    up in a sigh of relief and bowed his head and said that there was no other
    male, that he was responsible for both the murders”.</p>

line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>McIsaac
    then asked the appellant for more details and the appellant gave a detailed
    account of the two murders, including the fact that he had used an awl to
    kill Mr.&nbsp;Greenwood and that he had thrown the awl in the river.  McIsaac
    told Sheffer to go with the appellant to the river.  On the way, the appellant
    assured Sheffer that if he and McIsaac needed someone killed he could look
    after that.  When they reached the river, it was frozen over and snow-covered
    (as it likely was in January 1998 when the appellant said he had disposed
    of the awl after the
    <st1:City w:st="on">

    following day, Sheffer picked up the appellant and brought him to his supposed
    residence.  Sheffer told the appellant that his boss wanted the appellant
    to go over it all again.  Unbeknownst to the appellant this house was equipped
    with audio equipment.  The appellant repeated the story.  He was arrested
    a short time later.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was a serious contest at trial about where the appellant obtained the information
    contained in his statements.  The appellant testified that the details of
    the killings came from information provided by the police when he had been
    interviewed by them and kept under overt surveillance almost two years earlier.
     The Crown contended that some of these details had never been disclosed
    to the appellant.  The defence also pointed out that certain details of the
    crimes that would have been known to the killer were not mentioned by the
    appellant in his statements to the undercover police officers.</p>

    Richard Ofshe is a social psychologist and a leading expert on the phenomenon
    of false confessions.  His work was referred to by the Supreme Court of Canada
    in <i>R. v. Oickle</i> (2000), 147 C.C.C. (3d) 321.  The defence sought to
    call Dr.&nbsp;Ofshe to testify about the reasons that suspects falsely confess
    and the proper method of evaluating the reliability of a confession.  On
    a <i>voir dire,</i> Dr. Ofshe explained that, where the reasons not to confess
    are sufficiently reduced by making the suspect believe that resistance is
    hopeless and that some advantage may come from confession, both the likelihood
    of confession and the risk of false confession will rise.  It may eventually
    become attractive to a suspect to admit a crime.  Dr. Ofshe had not studied
    the Mr. Big strategy but believed that his analysis of statements to known
    persons in authority could be adapted to the Mr. Big method.  He testified
    that the inducements held out to the appellant were similar to the inducements
    held out in normal police interrogations.  </p>

    Ofshe also pointed out that, while the phenomenon of false confessions is
    very well known to social psychologists, most people presume that innocent
    people will not confess falsely.  Finally, he testified that the way to evaluate
    the reliability of the confession is to compare the details in the confession
    with the facts of the murder not given to the suspect by the police.  He
    also testified about the danger of contamination in this case, that is, the
    risk that details of the killings as conveyed to the undercover police officers
    by the appellant came from the investigating officers who had earlier interrogated
    him.</p>

    of the statements violates the principle against self-incrimination as guaranteed
    by s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  He also submits that the statements should
    have been excluded on the common law grounds that the prejudicial effect
    of the statements outweighs their probative value, that the statements fail
    the reliability prerequisite for the principled admission of hearsay evidence,

    decisions from the Supreme Court of Canada would seem to be insurmountable

    the Supreme Court of Canada held that the right to silence guaranteed by
    s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> is not infringed by undercover police operations
    where the suspect is not detained.  Then, in <i>R. v. McIntyre</i>, [1994]

    arguing that more recent decisions of the Supreme Court have held that s.
    7 is implicated whenever the state seeks to use self-incriminating evidence

    about unfairness and unreliability when the confession is made to a private
    citizen as a result of threats of imminent violence.  The court further recognized
    that the requirement that a confession be voluntary was rooted in concerns
    about reliability of an involuntary confession but also served interests
    of fairness and the administration of criminal justice, including the principle
    against self-incrimination. Nevertheless, the court reaffirmed the continued
    vitality of the person in authority limitation on the common law confession
    rule enunciated in the pre-<i>Charter</i> decision <i>R. v. Rothman</i> (1981),
    59 C.C.C. (2d) 30 (S.C.C.).  In short, the rule that an accused’s statement
    must be proved voluntary before being admitted applies only to those statements
    made by the accused to a person the accused believes to be a person in authority.  If
    there was to be any change in the law, it would have to be by legislative
    amendment.  In the meantime, the court held that concerns about the reliability
    of confessions to private individuals should be addressed through appropriate

    not a <i>Charter</i> case.  However, the court referred to and quoted from <i>Hebert</i>,

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>. . . one of
    the themes running through the jurisprudence on confessions is the idea that <i>a

    accompanied by a correlative concern with the repute and integrity of the

    for this is an important building block for the rule developed in <i>Hebert</i>,
    that a person in the control of the state has the right to choose whether
    to make a statement to the police.  Later in <i>Hebert</i>, McLachlin J.

    second case relied upon by the appellant is <i>R. v. White.</i>  In <i>White</i>,
    the court held that the use at a criminal trial of statements made under
    statutory compulsion by a motorist involved in an accident violates s. 7
    of the <i>Charter</i> and that the statements are inadmissible under s. 24(1).  <i>White </i>suggests
    a broadening of the right against self-incrimination recognized in <i>Hebert</i> since
    there was no suggestion that the motorist was physically detained.  However, <i>White</i> does
    not represent a wholesale re-evaluation of the right to silence to encompass
    any statement by a suspect to a person in authority.  In <i>White</i>, Iacobucci
    J. gathered together a number of propositions that inform the discussion
    of the scope of the principle against self-incrimination, including the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>an
    accused is not required to respond to an allegation of wrongdoing made by
    the state until the state has succeeded in making out a <i>prima facie</i> case
    against him or her [para. 41];</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    principle has at least two key purposes, namely to protect against unreliable
    confessions, and to protect against abuses of power by the state [para. 43];</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    principle against self-incrimination is an overarching principle within our
    criminal justice system, from which a number of specific common law and <i>Charter</i> rules
    emanate, such as the confessions rule, and the right to silence, among many
    others; the principle can also be the source of new rules in appropriate
    circumstances [para. 44]; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>but,
    the principle does not provide absolute protection against all uses of information
    that has been compelled by statute or otherwise; the residual protections
    provided by the principle against self-incrimination as contained in s. 7
    are specific, and contextually sensitive [para. 45].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Most
    importantly for understanding the argument made in this case is Iacobucci&nbsp;J.’s
    discussion in <i>White</i> of the importance of context.  As he said at para.
    45, “The principle against self-incrimination demands different things at
    different times, with the task in every case being to determine exactly what
    the principle demands, if anything, within the particular context at issue.”  Further,
    the contextual analysis must always be tied to the principles of fundamental
    justice.  Again to quote Iacobucci J., at para. 47, “Each principle of fundamental
    justice must be interpreted in light of those other individual and societal
    interests that are of sufficient importance that they may appropriately be
    characterized as principles of fundamental justice in Canadian society.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>White</i>,
    Iacobucci J. examined four contextual factors that led him to find that use
    of statements made under statutory compulsion from provincial traffic legislation
    violated s. 7.  Those factors were the existence of coercion, an adversarial
    relationship producing “a context of pronounced psychological and emotional
    pressure” (para. 58), the real possibility of an unreliable confession to
    a person in authority “whose authority and physical presence might cause
    the driver to produce a statement in circumstances where he or she is not
    truly willing to speak” (para. 62), and abuse of power in that “police would
    have a strong incentive or perhaps an unconscious inclination to overemphasize
    the extent of the statutory duty to report an accident under the Act, in
    order to obtain relevant information”
    (para. 64).  I should note that Iacobucci J. appears to place relatively
    little weight on the coercive nature of the statutory compulsion because
    the coercion takes place in the context of a regulated activity – driving
    on public highways.  Thus, he held at para. 55 that “the issue of free and
    informed consent must be considered a neutral factor in the determination
    of whether the principle against self-incrimination is infringed by s. 61
    of the <i>Motor Vehicle Act</i>”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying
    the contextual analysis set out in <i>White</i>, assuming I can do so free
    of the dictates of <i>Hebert</i> and <i>McIntyre</i>, does not lead me to
    conclude that the strategy employed by the police in this case violated s.
    7.  In doing so, I am conscious of the point made by Iacobucci J. at para.
    48 of <i>White</i>: “In every case, the facts must be closely examined to
    determine whether the principle against self-incrimination has truly been
    brought into play by the production or use of the declarant’s statement.”  Thus,
    it is not helpful to look at the Mr. Big strategy at large but rather as
    it was employed in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    context in this case does not violate the principles of fundamental justice.  There
    was little, if any, coercion.  The appellant was seeking employment in what
    he believed was an illegal enterprise.  While he had been the subject of
    intense surveillance many months earlier, the overt surveillance had ceased.  He
    claimed that he was unable to secure other employment but this is belied
    by the evidence that he had refused to follow up an offer of legitimate employment.  The
    motion judge dismissed the claim that the appellant was effectively prohibited
    from finding employment because of the actions of the police.  He also rejected
    the claim that the appellant was “inflicted with emotional and psychological
    trauma because of the intense surveillance”.</p>

line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    accept that the appellant and the police were in an adversarial relationship,
    but the appellant was not under “pronounced psychological and emotional pressure”.  The
    motion judge found to the contrary; that the appellant “displayed a composed
    and stable personality” during his interviews with the undercover officers.</p>

    this example of the Mr. Big strategy does not contain the elements of a real
    possibility of an unreliable confession because of abuse of power by a person
    in authority.  There was no abuse of power.  The appellant was presented
    with an opportunity to obtain employment in a criminal organization, but
    he was not threatened or intimidated.  Even if it is possible to apply the <i>White</i> analysis
    to this case, the evidence and the findings of fact by the motion judge undermine
    any claim to a violation of s. 7.</p>

line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    final case relied upon by the appellant is <i>R. v. Turcotte.  Turcotte</i> concerned
    the evidentiary value of a suspect’s silence in the face of inquiries from
    the police.  The court affirmed the common law right that, absent statutory
    compulsion, an individual has the right to remain silent in the face of police
    questioning.  Speaking for the court at para.&nbsp;41, Abella J. referred
    to the scope of the right as explained by Lamer J. in his concurring opinion
    in <i>Rothman</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    the right of a suspect not to say anything to the police . . . is merely
    the exercise by him of the general right enjoyed in this country by anyone
    to do whatever one pleases, saying what one pleases or choosing not to say
    certain things, unless obliged to do otherwise by law. It is because no law
    says that a suspect, save in certain circumstances, must say anything to
    the police that we say that he has the right to remain silent, which is a
    positive way of explaining that there is on his part no legal obligation
    to do otherwise.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Abella
    J. went on to refer at some length to <i>Hebert</i> and at para. 43 quoted
    what she characterized as a unifying theme of the confessions rule and the
    privilege against self-incrimination:  “[T]he idea that a person in the power
    of the state in the course of the criminal process has the right to choose
    whether to speak to the police or remain silent.”  She concluded that it
    would be an illusory right if the decision not to speak to the police could
    be used by the prosecution as evidence of guilt.  Importantly, for the purposes
    of this case, Abella J. held at para. 51 that the common law right to silence “exists
    at all times against the state, whether or not the person asserting it is
    within its power or control. Like the confessions rule, an accused’s right
    to silence applies any time he or she interacts with a person in authority,
    whether detained or not.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But,
    the context is all important.  The context in <i>Turcotte</i> was that the
    accused exercised his right to silence by remaining silent.  The appellant’s
    right to silence in that sense is not engaged in this case.  The appellant
    gave up his right to silence by speaking to the undercover police officers.  Only
    if the right to silence is absolute and capable of being discharged only
    by waiver can the appellant succeed by analogy to <i>Turcotte</i>.  But that
    position was rejected by the majority of the court in <i>Hebert,</i> even
    where the suspect is detained by the police.  In <i>Hebert</i> at pp. 40-1
    McLachlin J. described her approach in these terms:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>This approach
      may be distinguished from an approach which assumes an absolute right to
      silence in the accused, capable of being discharged only by waiver. On
      that approach, all statements made by a suspect to the authorities after
      detention would be excluded unless the accused waived his right to silence.</i> Waiver,
      as defined in <i>R. v. Clarkson</i> (1986), 25 C.C.C. (3d) 207,  26 D.L.R.
      (4th) 493,  [1986] 1 S.C.R. 383, is a subjective concept dependent, among
      other things, on the accused’s knowing that he is speaking to the authorities.
      On this approach, all statements made by a person in detention which were
      not knowingly made to a police officer would be excluded because, absent
      knowledge that the suspect is speaking to a police officer, the Crown cannot
      establish waiver. This would include statements made to undercover agents
      (regardless of whether the officer is merely passive or has elicited the
      statement) as well as conversations with fellow prisoners overheard by
      the police and statements overheard through mechanical listening devices
      on the wall. <i>There is nothing in the rules underpinning the s. 7 right
      to silence or other provisions of the Charter that suggests that the scope
      of the right to silence should be extended this far.</i> By contrast, the
      approach I advocate retains the objective approach to confessions which
      has always prevailed in our law and would permit the rule to be subject
      to the following limits.  [Emphasis added, emphasis in original omitted.]</p>

line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There

    McLachlin went on at p. 41 of <i>Hebert </i>to specifically address the issue
    raised by this case, the use of undercover police officers to elicit statements
    from a suspect who is not detained:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Secondly, it
    applies only after detention. <i>Undercover operations prior to detention
    do not raise the same considerations. The jurisprudence relating to the right
    to silence has never extended protection against police tricks to the pre-detention
    period. Nor does the Charter extend the right to counsel to pre-detention
    investigations.</i> The two circumstances are quite different. <i>In an undercover
    operation prior to detention, the individual from whom information is sought
    is not in the control of the state. There is no need to protect him from
    the greater power of the state.</i> After detention, the situation is quite
    different; the state takes control and assumes the responsibility of ensuring
    that the detainee’s rights are respected.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    may be that the right to silence recognized in <i>Hebert</i> could be extended
    to a case where the accused, although not in detention, was nevertheless
    under the control of the state in circumstances functionally equivalent to
    detention and equally needing protection from the greater power of the state.  But
    that is not this case.  This appellant was not under the control of the state
    nor was the context such as to require that he be protected from the greater
    power of the state.  The appellant’s assertion that elicitation and trickery
    are sufficient to require <i>Charter</i> scrutiny is not supportable by the
    authorities or by a reasoned extension of the principles in those cases.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that McLachlin J.’s reference to the right to silence applying
    only after detention in <i>Hebert</i> was <i>obiter</i>.  Even if that is
    the case, in my view, this court is bound by those observations.  In <i>R.
    v. Henry</i> (2005), 202 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.) para. 57, the court held
    that the weight to be attached to <i>obiter</i> comments “decreases as one
    moves from the dispositive <i>ratio decidendi</i> to a wider circle of analysis
    which is obviously intended for guidance and which should be accepted as
    authoritative”.  The requirement of detention in <i>Hebert</i> is very close
    to the <i>ratio</i> of that case.  McLachlin&nbsp;J. was concerned that recognizing
    a broader right to silence would jeopardize the legality of undercover operations.  She
    considered the expansion of the right to silence to detained accused to be
    a modest change that conformed to current trends in the law: see p. 39 of <i>Hebert</i>.  The
    right proposed by the appellant in this case would be a significant change
    in the law and inconsistent with the authoritative observations of McLachlin
    J. set out above.</p>

    it is necessary to consider the impact of <i>R. v. McInyre.</i>  The reasons
    of the Supreme Court of Canada are brief:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
class=loose1><span lang=EN style='color:black;'>The appellant argues that his
        statements made to undercover police officers after he had been released

        under ss. 7 and 24(2) of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.
        We share the view of the majority that the accused was not detained within
        the meaning of <i>Hebert</i> and <i>Broyles</i>. Furthermore, the tricks
        used by the police were not likely to shock the community or cause the
        accused’s statements not to be free and voluntary. The appeal is dismissed.</span></span></p>

    understand the effect of <i>McIntyre</i> it is necessary to look at the facts
    as set out in the reasons of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal reported at
    (1993), 135 N.B.R. (2d) 266.  The facts are sufficiently similar to the facts
    of this case that the holding is, in my view, binding on this court.  McIntyre
    was arrested for a murder and while he was detained an undercover police
    officer was placed in his cell.  The officer was unable to get McIntyre to
    talk and he was released.  Five months later, the same officer set up a chance
    meeting with the accused and set in motion a Mr. Big-type operation. Thereafter
    the plot unfolded in much the same way as in this case.  McIntyre was offered
    a job in an illegal operation on condition that he could prove he was able
    to kill if necessary.  The undercover officers required proof from his past
    to show that he was capable of killing.  At first he refused to answer but
    the officers continued to push him for answers and, when he realized that
    this was the only way of getting the job, he told the officers about the
    murder.</p>

          of the rights guaranteed under the Charter in the present case because

style='color:black;'>. Being perfectly free to hang around with or to talk to
          the undercover officers, the situation was very different from detention
          where the prisoner cannot choose his cell mates. I am not impressed
          by this argument because in this case, the undercover officer succeeded
          in passing himself off as a criminal and ex-convict. This allowed him
          to gain Mr. McIntyre’s trust by reason of having been placed in the
          latter’s cell. <i>This ruse, having its beginnings during detention,
          was successfully continued afterward</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</span></span></p>

    entire court, including McLachlin J., sat on <i>McIntyre</i>.  The issue
    of detention cannot be regarded as <i>obiter</i> in that case.  I do not
    think it open to this court to reject the detention requirement for this
    aspect of the right to silence under s. 7.  I would not give effect to the
    appellant’s <i>Charter</i> argument.</p>

    decision of the Supreme Court in <i>McIntyre </i>also directly meets the
    appellant’s submission that the strategy employed in this case would shock
    the community.  The facts in <i>McInytre</i> were certainly no worse than
    the circumstances of this case, yet the court held that “the tricks used
    by the police were not likely to shock the community”. I should not be taken
    as holding that the manner in which the Mr. Big strategy is executed could
    never shock the conscience of the community and lead to exclusion on common
    law grounds. However, the facts of this case do not meet that test.  </p>

    would also not give effect to the other common law grounds.  The argument
    that the prejudicial effect of the evidence outweighs its probative value
    depends on the theory that the inducement offered by the undercover officers
    produced an unreliable confession inconsistent with the known facts.  The
    appellant also points out the additional prejudicial effect of admitting
    the confession because it necessarily places him in a bad light, as someone
    willing to consort with people he believes to be criminals and join them
    in their illegal activities.  Counsel for the Crown and counsel for the appellant
    have carefully reviewed the facts relating to the murders and compared them
    to the details in the confessions.  In my view, the statements have sufficient
    probative value that it was open to the trial court to admit them  The most
    striking aspect of the confessions is the appellant’s identification of the
    probable murder weapon in the first killing.  While the appellant testified
    that he received this information from the police, the prosecution witnesses
    denied passing on this information to him.  This was an issue to be resolved
    by the jury.  </p>

    am also of the view that it was for the jury to decide whether in the context
    of a meeting where he was seeking work, the inducement of a job in an illegal
    operation would be sufficient to cause the appellant to falsely confess to
    past deeds.  This was not a case of such extraordinary coercion that it can
    be said the statement is too unreliable to be received by the triers of fact,
    nor a set of facts they would be unable to assess.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    to the fact that the circumstances surrounding the confessions showed the
    appellant in a disreputable light, the motion judge was satisfied that admission
    of the evidence would not result in an unfair trial.  His holding in that
    respect is entitled to deference. The trial judge warned the jury about the
    limited use to be made of the appellant’s record and the fact that he had
    been in various treatment centres.  While a broader warning about the limited
    use of evidence of disreputable conduct could have been given, the appellant
    does not suggest that such a warning was necessary in this case to ensure
    a fair trial. The jury would necessarily understand that this evidence was
    admitted to understand the context for the confession. Its admission was
    necessary not just to understand the Crown’s position but also the defence
    position that the police conduct had driven the appellant to resort to illegal
    employment. An analogous argument for rejecting a confession obtained through
    use of a polygraph was rejected by the majority in <i>R. v. Oickle</i>. See
    reasons of Iacobucci J. at para. 102 and Arbour J. dissenting at paras. 138-147.</p>

    other submission for exclusion of the statements based on the common law
    rests on a hearsay analysis.  The appellant submits that in light of <i>R.
    v. Starr </i>(2000), 147  C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.), it is open to this court
    to revisit the established hearsay exceptions, including the admissions exception,
    on the basis of whether the particular evidence meets the requirements of
    necessity and reliability.  The appellant argues that the admissions exception
    to the hearsay rule rests on the theory that admissions against interest
    are inherently reliable.  He points out that in the Mr. Big scenario the
    statements are not against interest since the suspect believes that it is
    in his interest to admit to a crime to fellow criminals.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the hearsay issue has been determined against the appellant by this
    court’s decision in <i>R. v. Foreman</i> (2002), 169 C.C.C. (3d) 489.  As
    Doherty J.A. pointed out in <i>Foreman</i> at para. 37, by reference to <i>R.
    v. Evans</i> (1993), 85 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.), the rationale for admitting
    admissions by a party rests on the theory of the adversary system, not a
    necessity/reliability analysis.  As in this case, the accused’s admission
    in <i>Foreman </i>was not made to someone whom the accused believed was a
    person in authority.  In <i>Foreman</i>, the admissions were made to the
    victim.  The admissions were admissible even though they had not been subjected
    to a reliability analysis such as would be required if the statements had
    been made to persons in authority and therefore had to be shown to be voluntary.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    defence sought to call Dr. Richard Ofshe to testify before the jury about
    false confessions.  I will briefly summarize his evidence as it was disclosed
    during a <i>voir dire</i>.  Dr. Ofshe is a social psychologist who has spent
    many years studying police interrogation.  He has consulted widely with law
    enforcement agencies and testified in courts in the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
    .  He has authored many books and articles, including articles in peer-reviewed
    journals.  The works of he and his associate, Richard Leo, were cited with
    approval in the leading recent decision on the common law confessions rule, <i>R.
    v. Oickle</i>.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[7]</span></span></span></a>  He testified that it is generally accepted that
    false confessions can be caused by interrogation tactics using psychological
    techniques.  There is no credible empirical research that has attempted to
    quantify the rate of false confessions.  His own view is that it is a relatively
    rare but regularly occurring phenomenon.  Dr. Ofshe has done no study of
    the Mr. Big strategy.  It is not a strategy used in the

line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence proposed to call Dr. Ofshe to testify principally about three matters.  First,
    that there is a bias among lay people against the idea that someone who is
    indeed innocent might falsely confess.  Second, he would testify about what
    motivates a person, including an innocent person, to confess to a person
    in authority.  Third, he would testify about the way to evaluate whether
    or not a confession is false.  I will briefly expand on these themes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    to the first theme, unfortunately Dr. Ofshe did not provide any information
    as to why lay people, such as jurors, have difficulty believing that an innocent
    person would confess to a crime they did not commit.  I note, however, that
    the Supreme Court recognized this phenomenon in <i>Oickle</i> at para. 34:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In this context,
    it may seem counterintuitive that people would confess to a crime that they
    did not commit. And indeed, research with mock juries indicates that people
    find it difficult to believe that someone would confess falsely.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    Dr. Ofshe did not provide any information as to why people have difficulty
    believing innocent people will falsely confess, it is unclear whether the
    information he could provide on that issue, gained from examining confessions
    to people known to be persons in authority, would be of any value in the
    different context of a confession to an undercover officer.  I will return
    to this issue when I consider the admissibility of the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    to the second theme, Dr. Ofshe spoke at length about how police interrogators
    persuade suspects to confess.  Again his work in this area relates to interrogations
    by people the suspect knows to be police officers.  He focused in particular
    on the use of motivators.  Low-end motivators, such as suggesting to suspects
    that they do the right thing, are unlikely to make an innocent person of
    normal mental make-up confess.  Rather, it is only powerful motivators involving
    psychological coercion that are likely to lead to a false confession.  He
    explained that police interrogators will describe the justice system to the
    suspect in such a way that even an innocent person may be persuaded that
    it makes sense to confess to minimize punishment.  This can be enough to
    overcome innocent persons’ obvious reluctance to admit to a crime and place
    themselves in jeopardy from the formal justice system.  One way this strategy
    works is by setting up alternatives.  The suspects are told that if they
    continue to deny their involvement they will be charged (in the United States)
    with capital murder and executed, but if they agree to what the interrogator
    thinks happened, for example a killing in self-defence, then the punishment
    will be less.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Ofshe testified that in an undercover operation like the Mr. Big strategy
    the possibility of being punished for confessing falls to zero since the
    suspect perceives the situation as one in which the state is not involved.  As
    he said:  “The significant question would be what’s the motivator that is
    being offered to elicit the compliance.  If the motivator is strong, if there
    is a powerful inducement, then depending on the power of that inducement,
    the risk of possibly eliciting a false confession goes up.”  He considered
    the Mr. Big strategy to be a potentially dangerous one because there is no
    downside to making the claim of involvement in criminality.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    Dr. Ofshe testified that the way to test whether a confession is true or
    false is to compare the information provided by the suspect with the known
    facts.  If the confession demonstrates actual knowledge of the crime that
    can be confirmed and is known only to the police and the actual perpetrator,
    it is likely to be true.  Thus, “errors” by the suspect in describing the
    crime are significant.  He also testified that contamination is a very serious
    problem in interrogation.  Contamination occurs because the suspect has acquired
    information about the crime from other sources, including the police interrogators.  As
    he said, “If you can’t eliminate contamination, you cannot know that if someone
    gets a fact right, and that’s an objectively knowable fact, you cannot know
    that they acquired that [fact] because they were present.  It’s always possible
    they acquired it because they were told about it.”  He described this part
    of his evidence as “very straight forward, it’s the basic principle of all
    investigation, looking for evidence that supports the existence of a fact”.</p>

line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    cross-examination, Dr. Ofshe provided a helpful summary of the assistance
    he could give to the jury.  He said that because the phenomenon of false
    confession is badly understood he could put the jurors “in a better to position
    to make their own judgment about how to evaluate the interrogation and also
    by focusing on the product of the interrogation, the confession itself”.  His
    role was “to try to dispel certain myths that are widely held, and also to
    make clear a simple analytic structure for understanding this particular
    interrogation strategy”.</p>

    his ruling, the trial judge fully and accurately reviewed Dr. Ofshe’s evidence.  He
    held that its admission was to be determined by reference to the test for
    admission of expert evidence set out in <i>R. v. Mohan</i> (1994), 89 C.C.C.
    (3d) 402 (S.C.C.).  He was also of the view that this evidence should be
    subject to special scrutiny because Dr. Ofshe was advancing a novel scientific
    theory.  In that respect, he referred to the decision of the Supreme Court
    of Canada in <i>R. v. J. (J-L.)</i> (2000), 148 C.C.C. (3d) 487.  There was
    an element of novel scientific theory because Dr. Ofshe was proposing to
    apply his expertise in “normal” interrogations to undercover operations such
    as the Mr. Big strategy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that Dr. Ofshe’s evidence did not meet the requirements
    of relevancy and necessity for admission of expert evidence.  As to the former,
    the trial judge appeared to find that Dr. Ofshe’s evidence was only relevant
    to the credibility of the accused and thus not a proper subject of expert
    testimony.  He tied this finding to the novelty of the science.  In his view,
    the witness was “attempting to use a technique for confessions used in circumstances
    with which he was familiar [formal police interrogation], to circumstances
    where no real study had been done, and with which he had little familiarity”.</p>

    agree with the trial judge’s conclusion that Dr. Ofshe’s evidence was not
    admissible in the circumstances of this case.  What I say here should not
    be taken as a finding that this kind of evidence could never be admitted
    in other circumstances.  I also intend to limit my analysis to whether the
    evidence meets the necessity requirement for admission of expert evidence.  I
    tend to agree with the appellant that the trial judge may have taken too
    narrow a view of the possible relevancy of the evidence by focusing solely
    on its value in determining the appellant’s credibility.  Dr. Ofshe’s evidence
    was broader than that and went to the question of the reliability of the
    appellant’s statements to the undercover officers in the context of the Mr.
    Big strategy.  This would have been an issue in the case, even if the appellant
    did not testify.</p>

line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    is well known, in <i>Mohan</i>, Sopinka J., speaking for the court, held
    that the admission of expert evidence depends on relevance, necessity in
    assisting the trier of fact, the absence of any exclusionary rule and a properly
    qualified expert (p. 411).  He described necessity in these terms at p. 413:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>What is required
    is that the opinion be necessary in the sense that it provide information “which
    is likely to be outside the experience and knowledge of a judge or jury”:
    as quoted by Dickson J. in <i>R. v. Abbey, supra</i>. As stated by Dickson
    J., the evidence must be necessary to enable the trier of fact to appreciate
    the matters in issue due to their technical nature. In <i>Kelliher v. Smith</i>,
    [1931] 4 D.L.R. 102, at p. 116, [1931] S.C.R. 672 (S.C.C.), this court, quoting
    from <i>Beven on Negligence</i>, 4th ed. (1928), p. 141, stated that in order
    for expert evidence to be admissible, “[t]he subject-matter of the inquiry
    must be such that ordinary people are unlikely to form a correct judgment
    about it, if unassisted by persons with special knowledge”.</p>

line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the three areas about which Dr. Ofshe proposed to testify did not
    meet this test.  In particular, given the particular circumstances, his evidence
    was not about matters on which ordinary people are unlikely to form a correct
    judgment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    start with his evidence about the bias among lay people against the idea
    that someone who is indeed innocent might falsely confess.  As I have said,
    unfortunately Dr. Ofshe did not explain the reason for this phenomenon.  I
    suspect that it comes from the difficulty that lay people have in applying
    their own experience to the circumstances of police interrogation.  While
    most people would understand how a person could come to admit to almost anything,
    true or false, under torture or physical coercion, they would find it hard
    to understand why someone would admit to a crime they did not commit and
    thus place themselves in greater legal jeopardy than they would encounter
    from simply tolerating the psychological coercion of interrogation.  If that
    is the explanation, Dr.&nbsp;Ofshe’s evidence would not be helpful to the
    jury since it was anchored in formal police interrogation.  If there is some
    other explanation for this bias, it was not forthcoming from Dr. Ofshe.</p>

line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similar
    considerations apply to Dr. Ofshe’s evidence concerning the manner in which
    interrogations are conducted and the motivators for false confessions.  I
    repeat a portion of Dr. Ofshe’s evidence quoted above: “The significant question
    would be what’s the motivator that is being offered to elicit the compliance.  If
    the motivator is strong, if there is a powerful inducement, then depending
    on the power of that inducement, the risk of possibly eliciting a false confession
    goes up.”  In this case, the motive for a possible false confession was obvious,
    as was the fact that there was no downside to confessing to men the appellant
    believed were criminals.  There were no myths to be dispelled; Dr. Ofshe
    would simply be describing what was obvious from the testimony of the police
    officers and, indeed, from the appellant’s own evidence.  The jury did not
    require Dr. Ofshe’s evidence to arrive at a correct conclusion on this issue.  He
    did not purport to offer an opinion as to how powerful the inducement was
    in this case nor whether it could have led to a false confession.</p>

line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    final theme of Dr. Ofshe’s evidence was that the way to determine whether
    the confession was true or false was to compare it to the known facts about
    the killing.  He would also testify about the risk from contamination.  Dr.
    Ofshe’s evidence would have been helpful on this issue, but, as the trial
    judge observed, helpfulness is not enough.  The entire defence was focused
    on this very issue.  The defence theory was that the details in the confession
    came from the police.  The defence also pointed out that some details that
    the killer would have known about were not contained in the confession.  The
    jury did not need help understanding this point.  As Dr. Ofshe testified,
    this is a straight-forward element of police investigation.</p>

    a confession may appear to be convincing evidence of guilt, there are cases

style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    jury should determine whether the statement contains details consistent or
    inconsistent with the known facts and evinces knowledge only available to
    the perpetrator with a pointed warning about the danger of contamination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first element of the proposed direction is based on the theory that it is
    counter-intuitive that innocent people will falsely confess, but the experience
    of the law is that this is a real phenomenon.  I should not be taken as holding
    that it would be wrong to give such a direction, but it was not called for
    in this case.  The law’s experience is with confessions obtained in formal
    police interrogations.  It is those cases where the risk of the bias referred
    to by Dr. Ofshe is greatest because, as I have said, the jury would have
    difficulty understanding why someone would place themselves in great legal
    jeopardy by falsely confessing.  But, given the very different circumstances
    under which the appellant’s statement was given, in my view, the warning
    was not required.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant relies upon <i>Hodgson</i> for the second direction concerning
    the weight to be attached to a statement obtained by an inducement.  In <i>Hodgson</i>,
    Cory J. suggested that Parliament should study the confessions rule and consider
    eliminating the person in authority requirement.  In the meantime, he suggested
    at para. 30 that, where a statement was obtained by a person who is not a
    person in authority by means of “degrading treatment such as violence or
    threats of violence”, a clear direction should be given along the following
    lines:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A statement
    obtained as a result of inhuman or degrading treatment or the use of violence
    or threats of violence may not be the manifestation of the exercise of a
    free will to confess. Rather, it may result solely from the oppressive treatment
    or fear of such treatment. If it does, the statement may very well be either
    unreliable or untrue. Therefore if you conclude that the statement was obtained
    by such oppression very little if any weight should be attached to it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, such a direction would have been of no assistance to the appellant
    in the circumstances of this case.  While there was an inducement offered
    to the appellant, his treatment by the undercover officers that led to the
    confession could not be properly characterized as degrading and did not include
    the use of violence or threats of violence.  It is apparent from the reported
    cases that there is wide variation in the Mr. Big strategy.  This was a comparatively
    mild version.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[8]</span></span></span></a>  The <i>Hodgson</i> direction was not required
    in the circumstances of this case.  The trial judge on several occasions
    pointed out to the jury why the appellant said he falsely confessed and that
    the defence position was that the statements were the product of inducements
    and police pressure.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    to the third suggested direction, in my view, the jury was given sufficient
    instructions in this respect.  The trial judge directed the jury that what
    details the appellant provided to the undercover officers and which were
    verifiable and accurate was an important aspect.  He told the jury to use
    their judgment and common sense when reviewing the details to see if the
    information had come from the police.  The trial judge then reviewed the
    evidence on that issue at length pointing out that they should also consider
    the details that were not included in the confessions that the real perpetrator
    would have known about.  In my view, these directions were sufficient in
    the circumstances.</p>

    that the Supreme Court has restricted the pre-trial right to silence for “pragmatic
    reasons”, he notes that “the assertion of requirements of detention seem
    foreign to the s. 7 right which has no such express triggering mechanism,
    in contrast to s. 10 rights which only arise on arrest or detention”.</p>
