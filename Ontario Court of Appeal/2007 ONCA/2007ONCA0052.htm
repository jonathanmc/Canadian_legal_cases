      appeal from the judgment of Justice Roydon J. Kealey of the Superior Court
      of Justice dated March 22, 2005.</span></h4>

      appellant raises two grounds of appeal.  First, the appellant argues that
      the trial judge erred in failing to find that the respondent breached a
      non-solicitation clause in his employment agreement.  That clause reads
      in part as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoBlockText align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US>2.3 …
    You will not on behalf of any company or partnership, attempt to solicit
        business from any IT/NET client or prospect in effect, we want to ensure
        that you will not use any “insider” knowledge for a period of twelve
        months.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    reaching his conclusion, the trial judge made several critical findings of
    fact.  To start, he found that at the time the respondent left the appellant’s
    employ, it was far from certain that the appellant was going to obtain the
    contract with the Department of National Defence (“DND”).  The trial judge
    accepted Colonel Bernier’s evidence that he was ambivalent about how he would
    proceed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly,
    the trial judge also found that the respondent did not attempt to solicit
    the DND business opportunity for his new employer, DMR Consulting.  Rather,
    he was approached by Colonel Bernier with the suggestion that DMR become
    involved.  Only then did the respondent discuss the opportunity with DMR.  Moreover,
    the DMR proposal was based on information that Colonel Bernier provided to
    DMR in the form of a Statement of Work.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    findings of fact were supported by the evidence.  We see no merit to this
    ground of appeal.  In reaching this conclusion, we should not be taken as
    saying that the non-solicitation clause in issue is unenforceable.  We are
    saying nothing more than that the facts as found by the trial judge do not
    constitute a breach.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s second argument is that the trial judge erred in not finding
    that the respondent disclosed confidential information to DMR.  The confidential
    information that the appellant relies on has two parts;  the fact that DND
    intended to let a Request for Proposal contract, and that, in addition, DND
    had discussed the nature of that contract with the appellant.  DND had not
    disclosed its intention or the nature of the contract to anyone other than
    the appellant and its employees, one of whom was the respondent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the information relied upon by the appellant would only have an aspect of
    confidentiality so long as DND did not disclose it to others which, of course,
    it was free to do.  The respondent did not disclose the information about
    DND’s opportunity to DMR until after Colonel Bernier had raised the subject
    with him and inquired if DMR would be interested in the contract.  Clearly,
    DND, the proprietor of the information, wanted it to be disclosed to DMR.  In
    these circumstances, we do not think that the respondent can be said to have
    misused confidential information.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    Colonel Bernier provided DMR, through the respondent, with a Statement of
    Work containing details to be used in preparing the proposal.  We do not
    agree with the appellant that the use of that information in the proposal
    constituted a misuse of confidential information by the respondent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, we agree with the trial judge that the respondent did not misuse
    confidential information.  The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.  Costs to
    the respondent are fixed in the amount of $12,000, inclusive of disbursements
    and GST.</p>
