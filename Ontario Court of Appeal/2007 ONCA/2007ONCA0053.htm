  <p class=headingtitle><b><u>Claim Against Pembridge</u></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants argue that the trial judge erred in finding that they were late
    in reporting their claim for loss to Pembridge and was, therefore, disentitled
    to coverage under their homeowners’ insurance policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was conflicting evidence as to when the appellants informed Pembridge of
    their claim.  In our view, it was open to the trial judge to accept the evidence
    of Mr. Groff that the appellants did not report the claim until December
    12, 2002 – over four months after the water damage incident. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Groff’s evidence was based upon the business records of Pembridge.  While
    Pembridge did not comply with the notice requirements of the <i>Ontario Evidence
    Act</i> with respect to introducing those records, it was open to the trial
    judge, in the circumstances of the trial, to exercise his discretion to admit
    this evidence.  The issue of the specifics of the lack of timely notice only
    crystallized during the trial and there was no prejudice to the appellants
    by the failure of Pembridge to give notice of its intent to introduce the
    business records.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    December 12, 2002, the date on which the trial judge found that Pembridge
    was given notice, the basement had been largely renovated.  It was very difficult
    at that point for Pembridge to adequately assess the water damage claim and
    the potential loss.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under
    the provisions of their insurance contract, the appellants were required
    to give timely notice of their claim to Pembridge.  We see no basis to interfere
    with the trial judge’s conclusion that the appellants were in breach of their
    insurance contract and, therefore, disentitled to coverage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    our conclusion in this respect, it is not necessary to address the appellants’ argument
    with respect to the applicability of the exclusion clause in the contract.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeader><b><u>Claims Against the Aguiars</u></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the appellants established their claim against their
    neighbours – the Aguiars, in nuisance.  There is no appeal with respect to
    this finding of liability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants appeal the quantum of the trial judge’s award of $4,000 damages.  We
    are satisfied that the appellants should succeed on their damage appeal because
    the trial judge misapprehended an important piece of evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence established that in October, when the appellants’ contractor began
    to repair the basement, the sand under the floor boards was still wet.  However,
    there was no standing or flowing water at that time.  The trial judge, apparently
    misunderstanding the evidence that indicated there were watermarks on the
    walls at the four or five inch level and up the drywall to four or five feet,
    found that in October there was still four or five inches of water sitting
    under the floor.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    considering the issue of damages, the trial judge attached considerable importance
    to this finding.  For example, he said that:  “The presence of this water
    made a bad situation even worse.”  He also said that because of the water
    remaining two months after the leak was shut off:  “… an inference may be
    drawn … that the basement is a wet basement to begin with where the problems
    are compounded after rainfall”, the suggestion being that not all the damage
    was caused by the leakage in August 2002.  Moreover, the trial judge’s error
    also played a role in his conclusion that the appellants had not taken all
    the necessary steps to mitigate damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the appellants had not established damages flowing
    from the nuisance.  He went on to find, however, that a realistic estimate
    of the amount of damage caused by the nuisance was $4,000.  In our view,
    this damage award cannot stand because it was influenced at least in part
    by the trial judge’s misapprehension of the evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are not inclined to send this matter back for a reassessment of damages.  We
    have reviewed the invoices of the appellants’ contractor who performed the
    work in the basement beginning in October 2002.  Clearly, a good deal of
    that work was for renovation and not repair of the water damage caused by
    the nuisance for which the Aguiars have been found liable.  The appellants
    are only entitled to recover damages flowing from the nuisance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the basis of the available evidence, we are of the view that a damage award
    in the amount of $12,500 plus prejudgment interest is warranted and we so
    order.  At trial, the trial judge directed that the appellants pay the Aguiars’ costs
    in the amount of $4,000 because the appellants had not bettered an offer
    to settle made by the Aguiars.  The award of damages that we have made on
    this appeal in the amount of $12,500 exceeds the Aguiars’
    offer.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants appealed the trial judge’s refusal to make a Bullock order at
    trial requiring the Aguiars to pay the costs award against the appellants
    in favour of Pembridge.  We see no basis to interfere with the exercise of
    the trial judge’s discretion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    to costs of the appeal, we direct that the appellants pay Pembridge its costs
    fixed in the amount of $5,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST.  We also
    direct that the Aguiars pay the appellants’ costs of the trial and the appeal
    fixed in the total amount of $10,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST.  </p>
