lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      October 24, 2002, the appellant attended at the Ontario Court of Justice
      in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    St. Thomas where the verdict in a sexual assault case was announced.  He
    wrote and submitted an article in which he referred to the complainant by
    name ten times.  The article was published on the front page of the newspaper
    on October 30, 2002.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Previously,
      on August 28, 2001, a Justice of the Peace had issued an order pursuant
      to s. 486(3) [now s. 486.4(1)] of the <i>Criminal Code</i> directing that
      the identity of the complainant or any information that could identify
      the complainant not be published or broadcast in any way.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
      the time the article was published, neither the appellant nor anyone else
      at the newspaper was aware of the publication ban.  The appellant had not
      attended court on the date the publication ban was ordered, nor on any
      of the other appearances before the verdict was delivered.  When he went
      to court on October 24, 2002, the appellant identified himself to someone
      connected to the court and asked for information about the charges.  He
      was not told about the publication ban nor did he ask if there was a ban
      in place.  He assumed there was no ban because he was not told otherwise.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Shortly
      after the article was published, the appellant and the publisher, Annex
      Printing and Publishing Inc. (“Annex”), were alerted to the ban.  The editor
      of the newspaper immediately sent a letter to the trial judge in the sexual
      assault case informing her of the article that had identified the complainant
      by name and expressing deep regret if the paper had breached a publication
      ban.  The letter indicated that if a ban was breached, the breach was “inadvertent” and “without
      knowledge that [a ban] was in effect”.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Subsequently,
      the appellant and Annex were jointly charged with failing to comply with
      the order prohibiting publication of the complainant’s identity contrary
      to s. 486(5) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  They both pled not guilty.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      a preliminary ruling, O’dea J. rejected the accuseds’ submissions that
      the <i>mens rea</i> for publication contempt under the <i>Criminal Code</i> is
      subjectively based.  Instead, he held that the Crown was only required
      to prove an intent “objectively assessed”.  While he held that the Crown
      must prove that an accused intended to publish the offending article, he
      concluded that it was not necessary to show that the accused had knowledge
      of the ban.  It was sufficient if those responsible for the publication
      ought to have reasonably foreseen that there was a ban in place and if
      the failure to foresee fell markedly below an acceptable standard of care.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After
      hearing further argument, the trial judge convicted Annex and acquitted
      the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
      to the appellant, the trial judge found first that he was not a principal
      or perpetrator of the offence of publishing the offending article.  He
      concluded that although the appellant submitted the article for publication,
      there was no evidence that the appellant was in a position to make decisions
      with respect to what did or did not get published.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge then considered the Crown’s argument that the appellant was
      liable as a party to the offence under s. 21 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  His
      reasons for rejecting this argument were brief.  The trial judge said:  </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I don’t believe that section 21 applies.  You can
    have two persons commit the same offence.  The Crown is still obliged to
    prove beyond a reasonable doubt that both did.  There is no indication here
    that there was an intention in common, and most definitely, there’s no indication
    that [the appellant] had anything to do with the actual final determination
    of the publication of that particular story.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Importantly,
      the trial judge appears to have considered the potential liability of both
      Annex and the appellant solely on the basis of an objectively based <i>mens
      rea</i> as it related to the existence of the publication ban.  He did
      not make a finding that either of them had a subjective <i>mens rea</i> involving
      elements such as purpose, intent, knowledge, wilful blindness or even recklessness
      as to the ban.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Crown appealed against the appellant’s acquittal, relying on the argument
      that the trial judge had erred in failing to properly apply s. 21 of the <i>Criminal
      Code</i> to find the appellant liable as a party to the offence.  Significantly,
      the Crown did not argue on the summary conviction appeal that the trial
      judge had erred in holding that the appellant was not guilty as a principal
      of the offence of publishing the offending article.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      June 27, 2005, McGarry J. allowed the Crown’s appeal and entered a conviction.  In
      doing so, he concluded, at paras. 10 and 11:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[10]  I agree with the submissions by the Crown
    as clearly the only reasonable inference that can be drawn was that the reporter
    accused prepared the story and submitted the same in the expectation that
    it would be published.  Thus this makes him a party to the offence under
    section 21.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[11]  Having found that the accused was an aider
    and abettor the appeal will be allowed and the conviction entered …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appeal judge also considered the Crown’s argument that the appellant could
      be found liable under s. 21(2) on the basis that the appellant had formed
      an intention in common with Annex to carry out an unlawful purpose – publishing
      the article in breach of the ban.  The Crown’s argument was premised on
      the notion that only an objective <i>mens rea</i> was required to establish “an
      intention in common to carry out an unlawful purpose”.  It is not clear
      from the appeal judge’s reasons whether he accepted this argument or not.  In
      any event, the Crown did not pursue the s. 21(2) argument on this appeal
      and I need not address it further.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After
      the appeal judge found the appellant guilty, he remitted the matter back
      to the trial judge for sentencing.  On December 8, 2005, the trial judge
      rejected the appellant’s submission that he order a discharge, entered
      a conviction and fined the appellant $500.  Previously, the trial judge
      had fined Annex $3,000.  The appellant appeals his conviction and sentence.</span></p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>Issue on Appeal</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      sole issue on the conviction appeal is whether the appeal judge erred in
      finding that the appellant had the necessary <i>mens rea</i> to make him
      liable as an aider or abettor under ss. 21(1)(b) or (c) of the <i>Criminal
      Code</i> to the offence of publishing the article in contravention of the
      publication ban for which Annex was convicted.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Consistent
      with the position it took on the summary conviction appeal, the Crown does
      not now argue that the appellant, as the author of the offending article,
      actually committed the offence of publishing the article in contravention
      of the ban.  </span></p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>The <i>Mens Rea</i> for s. 486(5)</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      concluding that the <i>mens rea</i> for an offence under s. 486(5) involves
      an objective test, the trial judge reasoned that the <i>mens rea</i> for
      non-<i>Criminal Code</i> contempt of court, particularly when it relates
      to a publication by a media outlet, only requires an objective test.  He
      also noted that regulatory offences frequently require a much reduced <i>mens
      rea</i> with the availability of due diligence as a defence, particularly
      when the failure to comply with minimum standards harms individuals who
      are vulnerable.  The trial judge recognized that he was dealing with a <i>Criminal
      Code</i> offence, however, and relying upon the Supreme Court of Canada
      decision in <i>R. v. Hundal</i> (1993), 79 C.C.C. (3d) 97,<i> </i>a dangerous
      driving case, he reasoned that an objective test, if it involved “a marked
      departure” from accepted standards, could be sufficient for some <i>Criminal
      Code</i> offences to pass <i>Charter</i> scrutiny.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge recognized that newspapers, strictly speaking, are not regulated
      by government.  However, he noted that when a newspaper enters the field,
      it is subject to self-regulation and should apply appropriate standards
      so as to not improperly harm the vulnerable.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appeal judge adopted the trial judge’s formulation of the <i>mens rea</i> required
      for s. 486(5) as did the Crown and the appellant on this appeal.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      these circumstances, I will proceed with the analysis of the issue raised
      by this appeal on the basis that the intent required for the commission
      of the offence under s. 486(5) does not require subjective knowledge of
      the existence of the publication ban.  A person may be convicted under
      that section upon the Crown establishing that the person intended to publish
      the offending information and upon proof of a failure to meet an objectively
      determined standard of care.  Given my conclusion on the <i>mens rea</i> for
      party liability, I need not decide whether the trial judge correctly held
      that only objective fault is required and, if so, the applicable standard
      of care.  I should also not be taken as having decided that the appellant
      could not be convicted as a principal.  As indicated, Crown counsel in
      this court fairly did not press that issue given the position taken in
      the appeal court.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      question then becomes whether the <i>mens rea</i> necessary to hold the
      appellant liable as an aider or abettor to the offence under s. 486(5)
      is the same as that for the principal, or if, as the appellant argues,
      it is higher, requiring an element of subjective <i>mens rea</i> as to
      the existence of the publication ban.  </span></p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>Sections 21(1)(b) </span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section
      21(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> reads as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>21(1)  Every one is a party to an offence who </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) actually commits it;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) does or omits to do anything for the purpose
    of aiding any person to commit it; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)  abets any person in committing it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Unquestionably,
      the appellant’s act in preparing and filing the offending article with
      the newspaper for publication was sufficient to constitute the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i> necessary to make him an aider to Annex’s offence under s. 21(1)(b).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      thrust of the Crown’s argument as to the appellant’s <i>mens rea</i> is
      along the following lines.  The <i>mens rea</i> for the principal offence
      of publication contempt involves only an objective test.  The <i>mens rea</i> for
      an aider to that offence should not be higher than that for the principal.  It
      would be unreasonable to hold that the appellant’s liability as a party
      could only be established on the basis of a higher, subjective level of <i>mens
      rea</i> when Annex’s liability as a principal could be founded on an objective
      standard.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Crown also argues that if the higher subjective <i>mens rea</i> is adopted
      for persons in the position of the appellant, “virtually all members of
      the media would escape liability for breaching publication bans, since
      the Crown would always be required to show that they specifically knew
      that a ban was in place but deliberately breached it anyway”.  This interpretation
      seriously impairs the protection of the publication ban provisions and
      diminishes the deterrent effect of the related fail to comply provisions.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      do not agree with the Crown’s submissions.  The starting point for determining
      the <i>mens rea</i> required for s. 21(b) is the language of the paragraph.  The
      language of para. (b) is very specific.  It requires that an accused do
      or omit to do something for <i>the purpose of aiding another to commit
      an offence</i>.  On the face of it, a requirement that an accused do something
      for the purpose of achieving a prohibited result imposes a very high degree
      of subjective <i>mens rea</i>.  “Purpose” under s. 21(b) is synonymous
      with
    “intention”:  <i>R. v. Hibbert</i> (1995), 99 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.).   While
    the <i>Criminal Code</i> does not contain a definition of either “purpose” or
    “intention”, the normal meaning of those words suggests that a person must
    subjectively advert to a specific objective and that he or she, therefore,

      seems to me that the notion of an objective mental element is completely
      inconsistent with the expressed requirement of “purpose” in s. 21(1)(b).  While
      it may be arguable that the requirement that an accused have a purpose
      includes any subjectively based <i>mens rea</i>, it would extend the language
      beyond its normal meaning to import an objectively based fault element

      decision of this court in <i>R. v. F.W. Woolworth Co. Limited</i> (1974),
      18 C.C.C. (2d) 23, is on point.  In <i>Woolworth</i>, the accused was charged
      with aiding and abetting the making of a misleading representation in contravention
      of the <i>Combines Investigation Act</i>.  Justice Kelly, for the court,
      explained that even when the principal offence was one of strict liability,
      as it was in that case, in order for an accused to be found liable as an
      aider or abettor he must be shown to have had actual knowledge of (or to
      have been wilfully blind as to) the circumstances necessary to constitute
      the offence he is accused of aiding or abetting.    </span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The trial judge correctly held that even where
    the offence is one of strict liability in so far as the liability of the
    principal is concerned, the liability of an aider or abettor to be convicted
    of the offence requires the existence of <i>mens rea</i> on the part of the
    aider or abettor.  <i>Mens rea</i> in this context means knowledge of the
    circumstances which make up or constitute the offence, that is, in this case,
    knowledge on the part of the respondent that the representations were made
    and knowledge of the true facts.  It was, of course, not necessary for the
    prosecution to prove that the respondent knew that those circumstances constituted
    an offence.  [Citations omitted.]</p>

    was sufficient to satisfy the <i>mens rea</i> for party liability under s.

    that only actual knowledge or wilful blindness of the facts giving rise to

      Crown argues, however, that while interpreting s. 21(1)(b) as requiring
      a subjective <i>mens rea</i> may generally be the proper approach to interpreting
      the section, it should not be used when the <i>mens rea</i> for the principal
      offence is less than full <i>mens rea</i>.  Otherwise, the Crown argues
      that there will be the anomalous situation of requiring a higher <i>mens

      do not agree with this argument.  Importing an interpretation that would
      require a lesser <i>mens rea</i> for an aider so as to mirror the <i>mens
      rea</i> for the principal offence would require ignoring or reading down
      the plain language contained in s. 21(1)(b).  Moreover, in both <i>Woolworth</i> and <i>Fell</i>, <i>supra</i>,
      this court did exactly what the Crown now argues against.  The courts interpreted
      s. 21(1)(b) as requiring a subjective <i>mens rea</i> – knowledge of the
      circumstances which make up the offence – even when the offence was one
      of strict liability insofar as the liability of the principal was concerned.  </span></p>

      addition, as Professor Kent Roach points out in his book, <i>Criminal Law</i>,
      3d ed. (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc., 2004) at 155, it makes sense to require
      a high form of <i>mens rea</i> for those charged with offences they do
      not actually commit.  He puts it this way:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Proof of purpose is required under the various
    parties provisions in the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  As examined in the last
    chapter, these provisions can make a person guilty of an offence even though
    he or she did not actually commit the offence and thus it makes sense to
    require a fairly high level of <i>mens rea</i>.  Section 21(1)(b) requires
    a party to do or omit “to do anything for the purpose of aiding any person” to
    commit an offence, and section 21(2) requires the formation of an “unlawful
    purpose.”  Similarly, attempts require “an intent to commit the offence,” and
    an accessory after the fact must act for the purpose of enabling a known
    criminal to escape.  The more peripheral the accused’s involvement to the
    completed crime, the more sense it makes to require a higher form of subjective <i>mens
    rea</i>.</p>

      reaching the conclusion that the <i>mens rea</i> under s. 21(1)(b) requires
      a subjective element, I am mindful that in <i>R. v. Jackson</i>, [1993]
      4 S.C.R. 573 the Supreme Court of Canada applied, at least in part, an
      objective test to the <i>mens rea</i> required for the offence of unlawful
      act manslaughter.  In that case, the accused and
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Jackson were charged with first degree murder.  One of the Crown’s theories
    was that the accused was liable as an aider or abettor under ss. 21(1)(b)
    or (c).  The court held that where an aider or abettor does not have the <i>mens
    rea</i> for murder, he may be guilty of the lesser offence of manslaughter
    if he possesses the requisite intent for that offence.  Unlawful act manslaughter
    under ss. 21(1)(b) or (c) does not require a subjective appreciation of the
    consequences of the act.  The test is objective.  A person may be convicted
    of manslaughter who aids or abets another person in the offence of murder
    where a reasonable person would have appreciated that bodily harm was the
    forseeable consequence of the dangerous act that was being undertaken.  </span></p>

    <i>Jackson</i> to stand for the general proposition that only an objective <i>mens

    <i>Jackson</i> importing an objective <i>mens rea</i> element applied solely
    to the consequences of the unlawful act, not to the facts or circumstances
    which gave rise to the commission of the principal offence.  As I understand <i>Jackson</i>,
    in order to found a conviction for unlawful act manslaughter, as an aider
    or abettor to murder, it would still be necessary to establish that an accused
    did or omitted to do something for the purpose of aiding the principal to
    commit the offence of which the principal stands charged, which is the <i>actus
    reus</i> of the offence.  In that regard, it would be necessary for an accused
    to have knowledge of the circumstances or facts that constitute the principal’s
    unlawful act.  Only then could it be said that the accused was doing or omitting
    to do something for the purpose of committing the offence as required by
    ss. 21(1)(b) or (c).  </span></p>

      I do not accept the Crown’s argument that interpreting s. 21(1)(b) to require
      a subjective <i>mens rea</i> for publication contempt will open the floodgates
      to the abuse of publication ban orders.  Principals, those who publish,
      are liable on the basis of the <i>mens rea</i> for the principal offence.  Those
      responsible for the actual publication are subject to the deterrent effect
      of the <i>mens rea</i> that applies to publication contempt.  Without principals,
      there can be no offending publications.</span></p>

      the issue of <i>mens rea</i> solely on an objective standard – that he
