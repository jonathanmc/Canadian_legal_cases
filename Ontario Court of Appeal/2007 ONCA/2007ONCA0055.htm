    1997, the Corporation of the Township of East Luther Grand Valley purchased
    a 10.5 kilometre stretch of abandoned railway right-of-way running from the

    Grand Valley to the western boundary of the Township.   Originally acquired
    for purposes of reserving its future use as a highway and/or a utilities
    and services corridor, the abandoned line has since been used and developed
    as a multi-purpose walkway and riding trail.  In these reasons I shall refer
    to it as “the Trailway”.</p>

    Respondents are members of an Ad Hoc Group of Concerned Landowners (the “Concerned
    Landowners”) whose rural properties altogether border about one-half the
    length of the Trailway.  Their primary complaints are driven by a lack of
    any fencing dividing and protecting their lands from the Trailway and by
    the nuisances and other disruptions to their normal lives resulting from
    its usage.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    late 2002, the Concerned Landowners decided to resort to the provisions of
    the <i>Line Fences Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.17 in an effort to alleviate
    their problem.  Section 20(1)(c) of that Act provides that a municipality
    acquiring lands formerly used as part of a railway line “is responsible for
    constructing, keeping up and repairing the fences that mark the lateral boundaries
    of [the land acquired].”  In <i>Casier et al. v. The Corporation of the Municipality
    of Bayham and the Corporation of the
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">

    establishes the municipality is liable for the entire cost of fencing when
    fencing is sought by abutting land-owners.” </p>

    Concerned Landowners, including the Respondents, submitted a demand for fencing
    to the Township, triggering a mechanism under the Act whereby persons known
    as “Fence Viewers” attend to inspect the lands in question and arbitrate
    the issues involving construction of the fence and the costs of doing so.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    demand for fencing set in motion a chain of events that culminated in the
    Township enacting By-law No. 2003-07, which is the subject matter of these
    proceedings, on March 25, 2003.  The By-law designates the Trailway as a
    “highway”, thus bringing it within an exception to a municipality’s obligation
    to fence under the <i>Line Fences Act</i> (section 25(1) stipulates that
    the Act does not apply to lands that constitute a public highway).  The By-law
    was passed without notice to anyone and given first, second and third reading
    at one sitting at the end of a Council meeting, just six days before the
    Fence Viewers
    – whose attendance was triggered by the demand for fencing referred to above –
    were scheduled to begin their deliberations.</p>

    Respondents moved to quash the By-law on the ground that it was enacted in
    bad faith and was therefore illegal.  They succeeded before Justice O’Connell.  The
    Township appeals from that determination.</p>

'>[1]</span></span></span></a> with a view to developing the abandoned railway
    line as a multi-purpose recreational trailway.  The Committee generated a
    feasibility study for the project.  Township Council was not involved in
    establishing the Trailway Committee; however, it supported the Committee’s
    proposal to develop the property into a recreational trail and appears to
    have left the initiative with respect to the trail development process – including
    the public consultation component – to the Trailway Committee.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Concerned Landowners made the issues about the use of the Trailway that disturbed
    them known to the Trailway Committee and to the Township Council.  This occurred
    both before and after the delivery of the demand for fencing under the Act,
    referred to above.  The concerns centred particularly around the fall-out
    from the use of the Trailway by motorized vehicles (snowmobiles and ATVs)
    but also included issues concerning noise, litter and other forms of pollution,
    damage to the adjoining landowners’
    properties as a result of people veering off the trail, and their potential
    liability in relation to people trespassing on their properties, as well
    as other problems.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Generally,
    it was the Trailway Committee that reacted to these overtures.  Following
    the demand for fencing, however, Council responded directly to the Concerned
    Landowners.  On January 8, 2003, the Clerk-Treasurer notified them by letter
    that a special meeting would be held on January 21, 2003, for Council to
    meet with them.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    January 21<sup>st</sup> meeting took place.  The Minutes reveal that numerous
    issues were addressed.  These included (a) the significant financial burden
    the liability to fence under the Act would impose on the Township, (b) the
    uses that would be permitted on the Trailway, (c) whether the adjoining landowners
    would have access across and along the Trailway, (d) concerns about the management
    plan, and (e) the potential liability of adjoining owners for any damages
    that might be caused to the fence, if erected, by their trees.  The Reeve
    indicated that the Township had purchased the land with the intention of
    turning it into recreational use, and indicated that the Township was looking
    for a solution to accommodate all persons involved (the adjoining landowners,
    the Trailway Committee and the Township).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, Council indicated its intention at the meeting to pass a by-law
    pursuant to section 5(2) of the <i>Line Fences Act</i>, which permits a municipality
    to forestall the work of Fence Viewers during the winter months from November
    to the end of March.  The demand for fencing had been submitted to Council
    in late December, 2002, and as a result, attendances of the Fence Viewers
    under the Act were scheduled for January 30, 2003.  Thus, when Council – true
    to its word –
    enacted By-law 2003-05 pursuant to section 5(2) on January 28<sup>th</sup>,
    the effect was to postpone those attendances until at least April 1, 2003.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    January 28, 2003, a letter was sent to the Respondents and the Concerned
    Landowners by the Clerk-Treasurer advising that the date scheduled for the
    attendance of the Fence Viewers was “postponed due to inclement weather and
    ground conditions”.  By letter dated February 3, 2003, they were provided
    with a copy of By-law 2003-05 and told that “the next date for viewing the
    fence on your property will be scheduled after March 31, 2003” and that they “[would]
    be sent proper notification by registered mail.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Six
    days before the arrival of March 31<sup>st</sup>, however, the Township passed
    the By-law that is attacked in this proceeding, By-law No. 2003-07.  The
    By-law designated the Trailway as a public highway, thereby exempting the
    Township from the obligation to fence the Trailway under the <i>Line Fences
    Act</i> – and relieving it of the expense of doing so.  Council passed the
    By-law at the end of its meeting on March 25, 2003 – giving it first and
    second reading, then immediately going into Committee of the Whole to discuss
    it, and directly thereafter “[rising and reporting] progress that the blanks
    now be filled in and the By-Law numbered 2003-07 be read a third time, signed
    by the Reeve and Clerk, sealed and inscribed in the By-Law Record Book.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    Council had been in regular contact with the Concerned Landowners regarding
    the fencing issues and problems arising from the use of the Trailway – particularly
    in the period following delivery of the demand for fencing – no notice was
    given to the Respondents or to any members of the Concerned Landowners or
    the general public of any intention to enact a by-law establishing the Trailway
    as a highway.  As far as can be determined from the record, no studies had
    been done demonstrating the need to designate the Trailway as a highway for
    any particular purpose at that time, nor had any study been done with respect
    to the estimated cost to the Township of constructing the requested fencing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Throughout
    this period the Respondents, Mr. and Mrs. Williams, in particular, continued
    to communicate with the Township and to complain about intrusions onto their
    properties and illegal usage of the Trailway.  They were advised by the Clerk-Treasurer
    that their letters had been circulated to Council.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Council itself dealt with the Trailway at its meeting on February 25, 2003.  It
    authorized the following uses for it:  hiking, cycling, equestrian, cross-country
    skiing, snowshoeing and snowmobiling (only upon suitable land management
    agreements being submitted by the Ontario Federation of Snowmobile Clubs
    and signed by the Deputy Reeve and Clerk<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

'>[2]</span></span></span></a>).  There was no indication at this time, or at
    any other time in the period leading up to the enactment of the By-law, that
    Council intended to turn the Trailway into a highway.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    this sequence of events, on April 8, 2003, the parties received notice from
    the Clerk-Treasurer that the Fence Viewers would be attending on April 14<sup>th</sup>.  Attached
    to the Notice was a copy of By-law 2003-07.  The Fence Viewers did attend
    on that date, but determined that they had no jurisdiction to make an award
    since section 25(1) of the <i>Line Fences Act</i> excludes lands that constitute
    a public highway from the application of the Act.  An appeal from that decision
    to a referee under the Act was adjourned <i>sine die</i> following the commencement
    of these proceedings in the Superior Court of Justice to quash the By-law.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>The Application Judge’s Reasons</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    a careful and detailed analysis of the facts, the applicable legislation
    and the law, the application judge made a critical finding:  he found that
    in enacting By-law 2003-07 in the manner in which it was enacted, the Township
    had acted in bad faith.  Recognizing that he must adopt the “generous deferential
    standard of review” towards the decision of a municipal council exercising
    its admitted authority,<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a> and that he “must interpret the By-law benevolently
    and support it if possible”, the application judge nonetheless concluded
    that the By-law must be quashed as it had been enacted in bad faith.  The
    substance of his reasoning in this regard is found in paragraphs 70-73:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>The question is why was the By-law passed as stated?  The Applicants
    contend that there was no reason for Council to pass the By-law, that it
    was passed in bad faith and the fact that Council failed to consider the
    interest of the Applicants at large and primarily to eliminate its own liability
    for the costs of the fencing, that it was illegal, because it was passed
    to eliminate the possibility of a proper decision by the line fence viewers
    and/or a proper application of the law under that <u>Act</u>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I am satisfied
    on the facts as ably outlined by Counsel in their respective factums and
    the authorities referred to, that the Applicants have satisfied the onus
    cast upon them.  That is, that the By-law was passed in bad faith.  The motive
    for passing the By-law was clearly established by the evidence, that it was
    to avoid responsibility that Council knew it had under the <u>Line Fences
    Act</u> and the law to fence and pay the cost.  The motive was established
    by reason of the following:</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The comments
    of the former Councillor, Mr. Hammond, ring true, if you need to fence it
    then designate it as a highway.  And as stated by Mr. Hastings to the adjoining
    Council, those remarks are the basis of the action of this Council unsupported
    by any evidence to support the necessity of By-law 2003-07.  Council knew
    what it was doing on March 25, 2003 at its meeting, when it passed the By-law,
    settling the demand for fencing and using the designation as a defence to
    the demand.</p>

    North York (Borough)</i> (1978) 20 O.R. (2d) 737, are important.  The factual
    situation of this case proves that Council acted unreasonably and arbitrarily
    and without the degree of fairness, openness and impartiality required of
    a municipal government.  <i>Winton</i> is referred to in the appellant’s
    argument where it is stated two of the most important indicia of good faith
    identified by the Supreme Court of Canada were frankness and impartiality.  <i>It
    cannot be said on this application that Council acted frankly and impartially
    in introducing and passing the By-law[;] that they did not have [a] sinister
    or collateral purpose; that they did not have an improper motive; that they
    exercised their powers in good faith.  I say that a generous deferential
    standard of review must be adopted by a court toward the decisions of municipal
    governments.  And I must interpret the By-law benevolently and support it
    if possible.  The good faith of Council is not evident.  It allows for the
    decision I make</i> that it was not necessary to pass the By-law for the
    purpose of reserving the property for future use as a highway and/or a utility
    service corridor given the anticipated future growth of the Township of East
    Luther Grand Valley and the need for construction and municipal servicing
    in respect thereof, as the Township owned the ARROW [“abandoned railway right-of-way”].  The
    Township could meet all of its requirements present and future, without the
    necessity of the By-law.  The failure of the Township to treat the ARROW
    as a highway after the passing of the By-law by allowing for a continuing
    use as a Trailway and supporting the committee’s activities, supports my
    conclusion that the By-law must be quashed and an order is to issue accordingly
    as <i>the evidence as a whole establishes clearly and convincingly that the
    By-law was enacted in bad faith</i> and the result is as I have indicated,
    that the By-law must be quashed and an order is to issue accordingly. [Emphasis

    decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>City of Hamilton v. Hamilton

    [1898] 2 Q.B. 91 (Div. Ct.).  The more liberal approach to statutory construction

    the decision of Council to designate the Trailway as a highway.  Principle
    amongst these factors was the budgetary concern regarding the cost of fencing.  The
    appellant submits, however, that the By-law was also responsive to a number
    of prevailing and future servicing requirements of the Township.  These include
    the existence of certain utility services already installed under the Trailway,
    the possibility of future utility installations and the possible extension
    of a sewer along the Trailway, as well as the potential use of the Trailway
    to provide access to a contemplated pumping station, a potential new wastewater

    he found that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In the material
    filed up to and including March 25, 2003, there is nothing to indicate Council’s
    intention to pass By-law 2003-07 designating the ARROW as a highway in order
    to allow for future initiatives of the Township, be they for a pumping station,
    water treatment plant, sewer lines or enlargement of facilities to accommodate
    the needs of other municipalities in the county.  There is nothing to indicate
    that access to and from the gravel pit abutting the ARROW and the new water
    treatment plant and sewer line within the Township, that they are hindered
    by the use of the ARROW designations as a Trailway subject to the rights
    of the Township as advised by the Township.  The material supports Council
    undertaking numerous studies with respect to the implementation of the much
    needed municipal services only after the By-law and requests of the committee

    application judge found that Council had passed the By-law for a collateral
    purpose – namely, “to avoid responsibility that [it] knew it had under the <u>Line
    Fences Act</u> and the law to fence and pay the cost” – and that in doing
    so it had “acted unreasonably and arbitrarily and without the degree of fairness,

    Township indisputably had the statutory authority to enact a by-law designating
    the Trailway as a highway: <i>Municipal Act</i>, <i>2001</i>, s. 31(1).  Consequently,
    this is not a case of a municipality attempting to do indirectly what it
    does not have the power to do directly.  Rather, it is a case of the municipality
    exercising a statutory power to enact a by-law for a purpose other than that
    envisaged by the statutory power.  Does the doctrine of bad faith apply in
    such circumstances, given the strong modern jurisprudential preference for
    generous deference towards the exercise of such powers by elected municipal
    officials?</p>

    my view, the obligation to act in good faith continues to be an essential
    characteristic of the valid exercise of by-law enacting authority by municipal
    councils.  It is one component of the modern deferential approach.  McLachlin
    J. implicitly acknowledged as much in <i>Shell</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 243,
    by relying upon the decision of Lord Greene in <i>Wednesbury, supra</i> – Lord
    Greene said that judicial intervention “would be justified where there was
    evidence of bad faith or absurdity” – and explicitly by stating, at 247-248:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>Expressing this notion another way, it could be argued, by analogy
    to judicial review of administrative tribunals, that unless a municipality’s
    interpretation of its power is “patently unreasonable”, <u>in the sense of
    being coloured by bad faith or some other abuse</u>, the interpretation should
    be upheld.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…
    Judicial intervention is warranted only where a municipality’s exercise of

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The “bad
    faith” prohibition is not confined to cases where a municipal council enacts
    a by-law in an attempt to accomplish indirectly what it is not authorized
    by its statutory powers to achieve directly.  There are, of course, cases
    of that nature where bad faith has been found and a by-law quashed for illegality:
     see, for example, <i>Barrick Gold v. Ontario (Minister of Municipal Affairs
    and Housing)</i>, [1999] O.J. No. 5015 (S.C.J.); affirmed, but on different
    grounds, (2000), 51 O.R. (3d) 194 (C.A.); Ian Rogers, <i>The Law of Canadian
    Municipal Corporations, </i>2d ed. looseleaf (Scarborough: Carswell, 1971)
    at 1021.  However, both <i>Equity Waste Management</i> and <i>Pedwell</i> were
    cases involving statutorily authorized municipal conduct – zoning in <i>Equity
    Waste Management</i>, and setting minimum lot sizes in <i>Pedwell</i> – and
    there is no reason in principle, in my view, to confine the good faith requirement
    to such cases.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    Laskin J.A. found that the record did not support a finding of bad faith
    in the circumstances, and notwithstanding his adoption of the deferential
    approach to the review of municipal action, his decision in <i>Equity Waste
    Management</i> was premised on an analysis of whether such bad faith could
    be found.  So too was <i>Pedwell</i>, where Rosenberg J.A. concluded that
    the trial judge’s finding of bad faith was supportable on the record and
    held that the finding could not be overturned in spite of the Court’s acceptance
    of the generous deference principle.</p>

line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    conclude, therefore, that good faith remains a central foundation for the
    validity of a municipal by-law enacted in conformity with the municipality’s
    power.  My conclusion in this regard is strengthened by the existence of
    section 272 of the <i>Municipal Act</i>, <i>2001</i>, which states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A by-law passed
    in good faith under any Act shall not be quashed or open to review in whole
    or in part by any court because of the unreasonableness or supposed unreasonableness

line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    provision reinforces the notion that municipal by-laws properly enacted are
    not to be lightly quashed; they are not open to review even if they are unreasonable.  It
    is a pre-condition to that immunization from review, however, that the by-law
    be “passed in good faith”.  This, in turn, reinforces the essential character
    of a valid and legal by-law: it must be enacted in good faith.  Such a requirement
    makes sense.  Unlike
    <st1:country-region

      <st1:place w:st="on">

    or the provinces, municipalities do not derive their existence and their
    powers from the constitution.  Instead, they are creatures of statute exercising
    powers delegated to them by the provinces:  see

    <st1:place w:st="on">

    then, constitutes “bad faith”?  Many authorities on this question draw upon
    the decision of Robins J. in <i>Winton, supra.  </i>That, too, was a case
    involving the enactment of a by-law that was within the statutory authority
    of the municipality (a spot zoning by-law).  The Borough of North York rezoned
    a piece of property in a hasty fashion and with no notice to the property
    owner in order to prevent its purchase for use as a Zorastrian temple.  The
    existing zoning had permitted use of the property as a church but there was
    strong community opposition to the proposed use.  No planning purpose was
    put forward to justify the zoning change or the selection of a single spot
    in the borough as the subject of the amending by-law.  The

    a frequently cited statement regarding “bad faith”, Robins J. said, at 744:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>To say that
    Council acted in what is characterized in law as “bad faith” is not to imply
    or suggest any wrongdoing or personal advantage on the part of any of its
    members: <i>Re Hamilton Powder Co. and Township of Gloucester</i> (1909),
    13 O.W.R. 661.  But it is to say, in the factual situation of this case,
    that <u>Council acted unreasonably and arbitrarily and without the degree
    of fairness, openness, and impartiality required of a municipal government</u>. [Underlining
    added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Equity
      Waste Management</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 340, Laskin J.A. concluded that “[b]ad
      faith by a municipality connotes a lack of candour, frankness and impartiality”,
      and that it “includes arbitrary or unfair conduct and the exercise of power
      to serve private purposes at the expense of the public interest”.  He cited
      the foregoing passage from <i>Winton</i> with approval.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge adopted the <i>Winton</i> approach to bad faith as well,
    holding that the Township Council had “acted unreasonably and arbitrarily
    and without the degree of fairness, openness and impartiality required of
    a municipal government”.  There was ample evidence in the record to support
    that finding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Pedwell</i>, <i>supra</i>, the
    municipality made the same argument the appellant raises here, namely, that
    the trial judge had been too interventionist and had failed to adopt the
    modern deferential approach to review of the validity of municipal by-laws.  Rosenberg
    J.A. rejected this argument, concluding at paras. 72 and 73:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>Some parts of the trial judge’s reasons suggest a more interventionist
    approach than is permitted under authorities…. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>However, when
    the trial judge’s reasons are considered in their entirety I am not persuaded
    that he erred.  He was alive to the role the court has in reviewing the validity
    of by-laws and that it could only intervene if there was a finding of bad
    faith.  The trial judge, moreover, accepted that the Town officials believed
    that they were acting in the public interest.  As he said, “their own subjective
    assessment of the righteous character of their conduct does not resolve the
    problems of whether they acted in good faith in so doing”.  The findings
    by the trial judge did not rest on second-guessing planning decisions by
    the Town.  He was concerned about the process adopted and the evidence that
    convinced him that the Town’s purpose was to target a development that its
    officials knew to be legal.  There was evidence to support his findings in
    that respect.  As in this court’s decision in Re Hall and City of Toronto
    et al. (1979), 23 O.R. (2d) 86 at 92 it was open to the trial judge to find
    that there was “a singular absence of frankness and impartiality, which are
    the usual indicia of good faith” and a
    “deplorable lack of frankness and a calculated disregard of the appellant’s
    right to make the best use of his property in accordance with the existing
    by-laws”.  Again, while I would not necessarily have reached the same conclusion,
    I cannot say that the trial judge’s conclusion is unreasonable.  He had the
    benefit of a lengthy trial in which the entire course of conduct was canvassed
    with many witnesses for the plaintiffs and the defendants.  He made findings
    of fact that I have found are supported by the evidence and he drew inferences
    that are not unreasonable.  In my view, this court is not entitled to interfere
    with his conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is much in the foregoing comment that can be applied to the case before us.  The
    application judge was well aware of his role in reviewing the validity of
    the By-law and of the requirement to give generous deference and a benevolent
    interpretation to the By-law and to support it if possible.  He thus gave
    effect to the modern approach to reviewing by-laws. The Council members’ belief
    that their conduct was in the public interest and their hindsight attempts
    to find an underlying justification for By-law 2003-07, however, do not resolve
    the issue of whether they acted in good faith in enacting the By-law.  The
    application judge recognized that his role was not to second-guess what Council
    had done; rather, his findings led him to the conclusion that the Township
    had acted for a collateral purpose and that the process followed had not
    been characterized by the frankness, openness, impartiality and regard for
    the rights of the Concerned Landowners that was required of the municipality
    in the circumstances.  His findings, and the inferences he drew from them,
    were all supportable on the record.  In my opinion, there is no basis upon
    which this Court can or should interfere with them.</p>

    Good does not submit on behalf of the respondents that the Township is forever
    barred from passing a by-law designating the Trailway as a highway.  Indeed,
    he concedes the Township has the authority to do so.  He argues, however,
    that the validity and legality of this particular By-law, having been enacted
    in bad faith by the Township, cannot be sustained.  In addition, he contends
    that the issue of whether the Township can enact a by-law designating the
    Trailway as a highway for purposes of avoiding the obligation to fence imposed
    upon it by the provisions of the <i>Line Fences Act</i> and the decision
    of <i>Casier, supra</i>, vis-à-vis these respondents, has been resolved by
    the decision of the application judge.  I agree with these submissions.</p>
