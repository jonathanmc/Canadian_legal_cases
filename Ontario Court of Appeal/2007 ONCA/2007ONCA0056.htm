    respondent was the appellants’ solicitor and charged a premium of $60,000
    after successfully negotiating a settlement to the appellants’ litigation.  The
    assessment officer denied the $60,000 premium, the motion judge set aside
    the order of the assessment officer and allowed the solicitor to charge the
    premium.  On the confirmation motion, the motion judge determined that the
    assessment officer had failed to take into account the exceptional skill
    and ability demonstrated by the solicitor.</p>

line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the motion judge erred in varying the assessment officer’s report.  The
    assessment officer correctly identified the various factors that ought to
    be considered.  His reasons then focused on the facts that the solicitor
    did not face a risk of non-payment of fees, was not carrying the litigation
    for the client, was not working at a reduced rate and had an agreement with
    the client on fees.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    other factors such as the skill of the solicitor were not specifically reviewed
    by the assessment officer, it is clear that the assessment officer was aware
    of the extraordinary result and the nature of the windfall.  We see no basis,
    therefore, for finding that the assessment officer did not take all of the
    relevant factors into account in reaching his decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on the findings of the assessment officer, the client had an agreement on
    rates and terms with the solicitor and, these arrangements did not involve
    the possibility of a premium:  see <i>Burgess v. Dauncey</i>, 2005 WL 434738,
    2005 CarswellOnt 815 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) par. 5.  The parties were aware that there would be a windfall before all
    of the work was completed.  There was no attempt by the solicitor to renegotiate
    the terms of the fee arrangement after the solicitor and the client became
    aware of the windfall.  In fact, the solicitor wrote to the client at that
    time confirming that he would be charging his hourly rate as agreed and taking
    his fees from the settlement funds.  The solicitor then simply charged the
    premium as part of his final account.  The findings of the assessment officer
    were fully supported by the record before him and are entitled to deference
    in this court and in the court below.  </p>

    a result, we set aside the order of the motion judge and reinstate the decision
    of the assessment officer.  Costs of the motion below to the appellants are
    fixed in the amount of $6,000 inclusive of GST and disbursements.  Costs
    of the appeal to the appellants are fixed in the amount of $7,500 inclusive
