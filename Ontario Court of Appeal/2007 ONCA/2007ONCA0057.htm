  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>BORINS J.A.:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, Terry Kuzyk, appeals from the judgment of Archibald&nbsp;J. dismissing
    his claim for damages against the law firm, Fireman LoFranco, arising out
    of the firm’s representation of him in the settlement of a lawsuit.  The
    trial judge allowed the respondent’s counterclaim for its fees and disbursements.  The
    appellant also appeals from the judgment on the counterclaim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    case has its genesis on December 24, 1988 when the appellant was injured
    in a motor vehicle accident.  Between the date of the accident and October&nbsp;2000,
    the appellant retained and discharged four lawyers or law firms.  He discharged
    them because he disagreed with how they were handling the case, or because
    he felt that they were negligent and incompetent.  In October&nbsp;2000 the
    appellant retained the respondent to represent his interests with respect
    to his long outstanding claim.  The retainer provided that the respondent
    was to represent the appellant on a contingency fee basis.  Although at this
    time the appellant had received accounts from three of his previous lawyers,
    he had not paid them.  He had not received an account from the fourth lawyer.  The
    respondent was not instructed by the appellant to pay, or to assume responsibility
    for the payments of the fees of his previous lawyers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    events giving rise to this action took place over a four day period from
    January&nbsp;18 to January&nbsp;21,&nbsp;2002.  On Friday, January&nbsp;18
    a voluntary mediation was held.  The trial was fixed to commence about two
    weeks later.  The appellant was present with his counsel, Mr. Solomon and
    Mr. Fireman.  Consequent to a settlement offer made by the defendant during
    the mediation, the appellant signed the following authority to settle:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I, Terrance Kuzyk, authorize my lawyers Fireman
    LoFranco, to settle my actions against [A &amp; B], for a total of $630,000
    for claim and fees, plus disbursements to be payable by the defendants.  From
    this settlement, I will receive $525,000.00 net. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    reasons that are not clear, at the end of the day the case had not settled.  A
    revised settlement offer was left on the table by the defendants, A &amp; B,
    for the sum of $650,000.00 all inclusive.  It was open until the end of the
    day on Monday, January&nbsp;21.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    January&nbsp;21 a lengthy meeting was held involving Mr.&nbsp;Kuzyk and his
    lawyers – Mr.&nbsp;Solomon, Mr.&nbsp;Fireman, and Mr.&nbsp;LoFranco.  The
    settlement offer and the appellant’s options were discussed in detail.  Mr.&nbsp;Fireman
    repeatedly emphasized that the offer of $650,000.00 included the appellant’s
    damages and the respondent’s fees and disbursements, but did not include
    the fees and disbursements payable to the appellant’s previous lawyers.  He
    made it clear to the appellant that the payment of those fees remained the
    appellant’s responsibility.  He advised the appellant that his options were
    to accept the settlement, or to go to trial, and in any event that he would
    be required to pay the fees of his previous lawyers out of his net recovery.  Indeed,
    Mr.&nbsp;Fireman testified that he considered the offer to settle to be excellent,
    and expressed his concern about going to trial as he had concerns about how
    a jury would view the appellant’s credibility.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the end of the meeting, the appellant instructed the respondents to conclude
    a settlement for $650,000 inclusive of disbursements, costs and interest.  He
    signed an authority to settle similar to the one that he had signed on January&nbsp;18.  However,
    this time the authority to settle provided that from the settlement proceeds
    of $650,000, the appellant would receive $500,000 net.  It is acknowledged
    by the appellant and his counsel that the $650,000.00 settlement negotiated
    by the respondent was exceptionally good and that the appellant had no complaint
    concerning the amount of the settlement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Central
    to the appellant’s claim against the respondent was his assertion that his
    instructions to the respondent were that the net settlement amount to him
    was to be over and above, not only the fees of the respondent, but also the
    fees of all of his previous lawyers.  The appellant alleged that the authority
    to settle was a contract pursuant to which the law firm agreed that the $500,000.00
    to be received by him was to be net of its fees and those of all previous
    lawyers.  In addition, he claimed that the respondent was negligent in its
    estimate of the likely fees of one of the previous lawyers, that it was in
    breach of its fiduciary duty to him and that it had exerted undue influence
    upon him.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge stated that if he were to accept the appellant’s testimony and
    his interpretation of the authority to settle, it would follow that he would
    find for the appellant.  However, the trial judge rejected the appellant’s
    testimony.  Following a thorough review of his testimony, including correspondence
    between the parties that preceded the settlement, the trial judge concluded
    that the appellant’s testimony was not credible.  He provided extensive reasons
    in support of his conclusion.  In particular, the trial judge stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mr. Kuzyk asserted that he was not informed about
    the gross terms of settlement and was largely not informed about the settlement
    and how the net settlement amount was derived. I do not, whatsoever, accept
    Mr. Kuzyk’s evidence on that point. It is in direct contrast to the evidence
    of Messrs. Solomon, LoFranco, and Fireman. Further, his assertion defies
    common sense and logic; Mr. Kuzyk would have had to sign the releases upon
    settlement and those releases would have necessarily set out the gross settlement
    number. Given that reality, the conclusion is inescapable that Messrs. Fireman,
    LoFranco, and Solomon would have disclosed to Mr. Kuzyk, with nicety, all
    of the terms of the settlement. Moreover, having heard their testimony, I
    completely accept their evidence on this issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    clearly rejecting the appellant’s testimony, and concluding that the testimony
    of Messrs. Solomon, LoFranco and Fireman was credible, trustworthy and persuasive,
    the trial judge found as follows in paras.&nbsp;16 and 18:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I have concluded based upon their testimony that
    Messrs. Solomon and Fireman made it very clear to Mr. Kuzyk that whatever
    the net settlement would be, Mr. Kuzyk, himself, would be responsible for
    paying his prior lawyers’ accounts. Mr. Solomon testified that the issue
    arose on many occasions in his discussions with Mr. Kuzyk and that during
    all of those discussions, he stressed that the settlement of the case would
    be net of Fireman LoFranco’s fees only, not net of the prior lawyers’ fees,
    which Mr. Kuzyk would have to pay out of his settlement proceeds. I accept
    the evidence of Mr. Solomon, which is also supported by Mr. Fireman’s testimony.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . . .
    .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Finally, as I have stated previously, Mr. Kuzyk
    is a very sophisticated and intelligent businessman. There is no question
    in my mind, based upon the totality of the evidence, that he was fully aware
    of his obligations to pay the fees of his prior lawyers and that this obligation
    would have to be fulfilled out of his net settlement proceeds.&nbsp; That
    conclusion substantially leads to the dismissal of the plaintiff’s case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge, correctly in my view, rejected the appellant’s contention that
    the authority to settle that he signed on January&nbsp;21, 2002 was a binding
    contract between himself and the respondent.  In the event that this finding
    might be found to be incorrect, the trial judge went on in para.&nbsp;24
    to interpret the document:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, the intention of the parties is plainly
    expressed by the language of this agreement.&nbsp; Specifically, the contract
    is between Mr. Kuzyk and Fireman LoFranco. The authorization concerns a potential
    settlement of the personal injury case on behalf of Mr. Kuzyk and the defendants
    are [A&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;B].&nbsp; These are the only individuals mentioned
    in the Authority to Settle. In staying within the four corners of the authorization,
    it is my conclusion that the word “net” means net of Fireman LoFranco’s bill
    and any other costs legitimately arising out of Fireman LoFranco’s prosecution
    of the personal injury claim on behalf of Mr. Kuzyk. I do not agree with
    Mr. Gaertner that any reasonable interpretation would allow for the importation
    into the document of the expenses of the four lawyers who are unnamed in
    the Authority to Settle in any fashion, direct or otherwise, and who are
    not signatories to the retainer between the plaintiff and the defendant dated
    October 16, 2000.&nbsp; In interpreting the authorization within its four
    corners, one cannot conclude that the word net would naturally encompass
    the fees of the prior four lawyers.&nbsp; In my view, the terms of the authorization
    are free of ambiguity, and it can only be read in favour of the defendant’s
    position.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the trial judge clearly and forcefully explained his determination
    of the credibility of the parties, interpreted the authority to settle and
    concluded that the appellant was aware of his obligation to pay the fees
    of his prior lawyers.  The appellant has provided no grounds on which I can
    interfere with those findings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also rejected the appellant’s claim that the respondent was negligent
    in respect to the advice he was given about the account of his fourth lawyer,
    Daniel Daly, that had not been rendered at the time of the settlement.  He
    accepted Mr. Fireman’s testimony that he never left the appellant with any
    impression other than that he would attempt to convince Mr. Daly to reduce
    his account, and that he advised the appellant that the appellant would be
    responsible for the payment of the account, whatever its amount, from his
    net settlement proceeds.  The trial judge concluded that the respondent was
    not negligent in proceeding with the mediation and the settlement in the
    absence of Mr. Daly’s account.  Moreover, had the appellant gone to trial
    he would have continued to be responsible for the payment of Mr. Daly’s account
    when rendered, subject to assessment, regardless of the outcome of the trial.  As
    well, the appellant did not establish that had he gone to trial, he would
    have been in a better position in respect to the payment of Mr.&nbsp;Daly’s
    account, as well as the accounts of his other lawyers, than had he settled.  In
    my view, the trial judge did not err in rejecting the appellant’s claim in
    negligence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in rejecting his claim that
    the respondent had breached his fiduciary duty to him.  It was contended, <i>inter
    alia</i>, that the respondent had preferred its own self&#8209;interest over
    that of the appellant in urging him to accept the settlement and that it
    had coerced the appellant into accepting a reduced net settlement.  In the
    trial judge’s view, the evidence did not support any of the appellant’s arguments
    that the respondent breached its fiduciary duty to him.  He stated:
    “Mr.&nbsp;Kuzyk’s evidence that he was uninformed of the details of the settlement
    and that he was coerced into settling is simply unbelievable.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    concluding that none of the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty by the respondent
    had been established, at paras.&nbsp;58 and 59 the trial judge made these
    findings:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The evidence of the three lawyers was that Mr.
    Kuzyk accepted the settlement offer on the basis that if he had gone to trial,
    the likelihood of greater success was minimal.&nbsp; This was a very generous
    settlement proposal and one that was significantly higher than the other
    offers which the four prior lawyers had previously achieved.&nbsp; Importantly,
    Mr. Gaertner concedes that the settlement offer attained by Mr. Fireman at
    the mediation was exceptionally generous in all of the circumstances.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Having listened carefully to the evidence of Mr.
    Kuzyk and all three of the lawyers who participated in the meeting of January
    21, 2002, I have come to the conclusion, based upon the specific facts of
    this case, that there was no apparent conflict between the interests of the
    lawyers and Mr. Kuzyk.&nbsp; Mr. Kuzyk was fully advised of all of the negotiations
    and the potential settlement and, if he wished, he could have rejected the
    settlement proposal.&nbsp; The lawyers suggested to him that the settlement
    was reasonable in all of the circumstances and probably constituted a better
    result than he could have achieved at trial.&nbsp; Fully apprised of all
    of the important factors and details, Mr. Kuzyk made an informed and voluntary
    decision which was in his best interests.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant stressed that in three letters that he wrote to the respondent
    prior to the mediation of January&nbsp;18,&nbsp;2002 he indicated that it
    was his wish to settle his claims on the basis that he would net $600,000.00
    after the payment of the accounts of his four previous lawyers.  However,
    it is one thing for the appellant to have wanted to achieve this result,
    but it is another thing to have been able to achieve that result given the
    value of his claim.  Mr.&nbsp;Solomon had advised the appellant that his
    damages fell within the range of $400,000.00 to $600,000.00.  This was confirmed
    by Mr. Fireman.  Based on this advice, it was unrealistic for the appellant
    to have believed that had he gone to trial, he could have achieved a result
    that would have produced a payment to him of $600,000.00 net of the fees
    of his previous lawyers, as well as the respondent’s fees.  Moreover, as
    I have indicated, both at the opening of trial and before this court, the
    appellant conceded that the settlement negotiated by the respondent was extremely
    favourable.  As well, it would have been unrealistic for an experienced lawyer
    such as Mr.&nbsp;Fireman to have recommended the settlement of the appellant’s
    claim based on the appellant’s interpretation of the authority to settle
    that he signed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    I am obliged to express my concern regarding Mr.&nbsp;Fireman’s failure to
    provide the appellant with a written explanation of the effect of the authority
    to settle on his responsibility to pay his previous lawyers’ fees.  It would
    have been the better practice had Mr.&nbsp;Fireman required the appellant
    to sign an acknowledgement that although he was to receive $500,000.00 net
    of the respondent’s fees and disbursements, he would continue to be responsible
    for the payment of the fees of his previous lawyers.  However, based on the
    trial judge’s assessment of credibility and his findings of fact, nothing
    turns on this omission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant has provided no grounds for interference with the result of the
    respondent’s counterclaim awarding it its fees and disbursements for representing
    the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs on a partial
    indemnity basis fixed at $25,000.00, inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
