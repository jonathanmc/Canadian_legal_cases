  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the order of
      Justice F. Kiteley of the Superior Court of Justice dated March 3, 2006.</span></h4>
  <h2>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent was convicted, in the Ontario Court of Justice, of sexual assault
    and sexual exploitation of a person with a disability.  He was sentenced
    to six months in custody and two years probation.  He appealed against conviction
    and sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    summary conviction appeal court justice allowed the appeal against conviction
    and ordered a new trial.  She would have dismissed the sentence appeal.  The
    appeal court justice allowed the appeal based on a single phrase in the lengthy
    reasons of the trial judge.  The passage in which this phrase is found reads
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>One more telling item of evidence against the accused
    is the fact that to his knowledge he would have been with Miss&nbsp;Mahabir
    on the evening in question.  He and his wife learned that Miss&nbsp;Mahabir
    had not been truthful with the authorities on Wednesday, May the 29th.  That
    alerted them to this fact, <i>they chose to say nothing</i> but instead,
    in my view, played a role in concocting the fabricated letter, that I accept
    Miss&nbsp;Mahabir did not write willingly  [emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal court justice held that the phrase meant that the respondent and his
    wife had failed to go to the police and that the trial judge erred by drawing
    an advance inference contrary to the respondent’s right to silence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown applies for leave to appeal the order of the appeal court justice quashing
    the convictions.  For the reasons that follow, we would grant leave and allow
    the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge gave thorough and cogent reasons for accepting the complainant’s
    account of the events and for rejecting the respondent’s version of what
    took place.  After summarizing the evidence in detail, the trial judge noted
    that he was struck by the number of “coincidences and internal inconsistencies” in
    the testimony of the respondent and his wife.  He listed numerous grounds
    for disbelieving the respondent, all of which are firmly grounded in the
    evidence.  He concluded that he did not believe the respondent’s testimony
    and that it did not raise a reasonable doubt.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    contrast, the trial judge accepted the complainant’s evidence “without hesitation”.  He
    gave a host of detailed, thoughtful reasons for finding her evidence to be
    credible and believable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the appeal court justice misinterpreted the impugned phrase.  We
    begin by noting the position of the impugned passage in the reasons.  It
    follows immediately after a paragraph that reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Miss&nbsp;Mahabir’s testimony must certainly be
    approached carefully.  She impressed me as a pathetic witness who was being
    manoeuvred and engineered into a position of helping the accused given the
    allegations that he found had been lodged against him.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    is, the impugned passage comes immediately after a description of Ms.&nbsp;Mahabir
    and her role in the events.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    trial judge’s reasons must be read in context and as a whole.  See <i>R.
    v. Morrissey</i> (1997), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  When read in that context and in light of the evidence that neither the
    respondent nor his wife challenged Ms. Mahabir when they learned that she
    had been untruthful with the authorities, when the trial judge noted that
    the respondent and his wife chose to say nothing, we understand him to be
    referring to their failure to speak to Ms. Mahabir, not the police.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assuming
    that there is ambiguity in the passage, the appeal court justice was bound
    to interpret the passage in a manner consistent with trial judge’s presumed
    knowledge of the law (in this case, the accused person’s right to silence)
    and her failure to do so constitutes reversible error.  See <i>Morrissey</i> at
    p.&nbsp;204.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, we do not view the trial judge as having drawn an adverse inference
    from the fact that the respondent and his wife chose to say nothing.  Rather,
    when read in context, the passage shows that the trial judge drew the entirely
    permissible inference that the respondent and his wife played a role in concocting
    the fabricated letter and manipulated Ms.&nbsp;Mahabir into helping them
    attempt to cover up the offences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal court justice dismissed all the other grounds of appeal raised by
    the respondent.  She made no errors in those determinations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    leave to appeal against conviction granted, the appeal is allowed and the
    convictions restored.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent has asked that the appeal against sentence be remitted to be heard
    by a different summary conviction appeal court justice.  We do not accede
    to this request.  We see no error in the sentence imposed or in the reasons
    of the appeal court justice dismissing the appeal against sentence as imposed
    by the trial judge.</p>
