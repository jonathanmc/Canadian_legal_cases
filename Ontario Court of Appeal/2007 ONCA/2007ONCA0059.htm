    alleged various causes of action against Regional and Gordon at trial.  The trial judge found a breach of contract,
    but rejected the other claims made by Dumbrell.  Dumbrell’s contract was with Regional and only Regional.  He could have no reasonable expectation of
    recovery upon breach of the contract from any entity other than Regional.  I see no legal basis upon which Gordon could
    be found personally liable for a breach of the contract made between Dumbrell
    and Regional.  Nor can Gordon be liable
    for inducing Regional’s breach of contract.  Dumbrell did not plead that cause of action and did not adduce evidence
    capable of establishing that Gordon induced a breach of contract.</span></p>

    purchase and development of those properties.  Dumbrell would be paid a commission on the profits earned from the projects

    various drafts of the contract.  Almost
    all of these changes reflected Gordon’s and not Dumbrell’s preferences.   Eventually, in November 1998, they agreed on
    the terms and both signed the agreement.  Gordon signed as president of Regional.  </span></p>

    Queen Street property in November
    1998.  The property was owned by Canadian

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ottawa and in late 1998 was being used as a
    parking lot.  It was zoned for use as

    the need for office space increased in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Ottawa.  He also believed that the property was ripe
    for development in late 1998.  The
    property was not on the market, but Dumbrell mentioned it to Gordon as a
    potential project for development by Regional.  Gordon encouraged him to look into the possibility of acquiring the

    Queen Street property.  He received information from an employee of
    CREIT pertaining to possible development plans for the property and certain

    after Dumbrell acquired information from CREIT, he contacted an architect who
    had worked on development plans for that property some years earlier.  Dumbrell and the architect spoke at length
    and the architect gave Dumbrell a great deal of background information
    pertaining to the property.  Based on the
    information he had accumulated, Dumbrell concluded that the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address

    Queen Street
    property for $7,745,000.  That offer was

    $9,000,000, but providing for a shorter due diligence period, was submitted by
    Dumbrell on Gordon’s instructions.  This

    Gateway decided they were no longer interested in purchasing the

    Queen Street
    property.  In July 1999, Dumbrell, on Gordon’s
    direction, prepared a fourth offer.  This
    offer showed Regional as the purchaser at a purchase price of $9.3
    million.  It also provided for a $300,000
    commission payable to Regional on closing by CREIT.  The corporate identity of the purchaser was
    irrelevant to Dumbrell.  As far as he was
    concerned, he was working on a “Regional” project and it was up to Gordon to
    decide what corporate entities would be used to effect the transactions and subsequent
    development of the property.  </span></p>

    accepted the benefit of the work done by Dumbrell regarding the Queen Street

    was entitled to compensation for profits earned after the termination of the

    as controlling.  In <i>Charles P. Rowen</i>, the court was faced with a true principal-agent
    relationship, the terms of which had not been reduced to writing by the

    with interpreting a written commercial contract, cite either or both of <i>Consolidated-Bathurst Export Limited v.
    Mutual Boiler and Machinery Insurance Company</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 888 at 901, and <i>Eli Lilly &amp; Co. v. Novopharm Ltd.</i>,
    [1998] 2 S.C.R. 129 at paras. 52-56.  Professor
    Ruth Sullivan has observed that these two authorities can be read as advancing different
    notions of contractual intent.  She
    observes that <i>Consolidated-Bathurst</i>, <i>supra</i>, arguably looks to the subjective
    intention of the contracting parties at the time the contract was made, while <i>Eli Lilly</i>, <i>supra</i>, looks to the intent as discerned from the words used in the
    written contract.  Professor Sullivan
    refers to the former approach as the intentionalist approach, and the latter as
    the textualist approach:  see Ruth

    intent of the parties” for contractual purposes:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The trial judge
    appeared to take <i>Consolidated-Bathurst</i> to stand for the proposition that the ultimate goal of contractual
    interpretation should be to ascertain the true intent of the parties at the
    time of entry into the contract, and that, in undertaking this inquiry, it is
    open to the trier of fact to admit extrinsic evidence as to the subjective
    intentions of the parties at that time.  In my view, this approach is not quite accurate.  The contractual intent of the parties is to
    be determined by reference to the words they used in drafting the document,
    possibly read in light of the surrounding circumstances which were prevalent at
    the time.  </p>

    focus is on the meaning of the words used in the contract.  Evidence of the subjective intention of the
    parties has “no independent place” in the interpretative process:  <i>Eli
    Lilly</i>, at para. 54;  see also

    least in the context of commercial relationships, it is not helpful to frame
    the analysis in terms of the subjective intention of the parties at the time
    the contract was drawn.  This is so for at
    least two reasons.  First, emphasis on
    subjective intention denudes the contractual arrangement of the certainty that reducing
    an arrangement to writing was intended to achieve.  This is particularly important where, as is
    often the case, strangers to the contract must rely on its terms.  They have no way of discerning the actual intention
    of the parties, but must rely on the intent expressed in the written words.  Second, many contractual disputes involve
    issues on which there is no common subjective intention between the
    parties.  Quite simply, the answer to
    what the parties intended at the time they entered into the contract will often
    be that they never gave it a moment’s thought until it became a problem:  see Kim Lewison, <i>The Interpretation of Contracts</i>, 3d ed. (London: Sweet &amp;

    contract drawn between the parties must be the focal point of the
    interpretative exercise.  The inquiry
    must be into the meaning of the words and not the subjective intentions of the
    parties.  In this sense, my approach is
    textualist.  However, the meaning of the
    written agreement must be distinguished from the dictionary and syntactical
    meaning of the words used in the agreement.  Lord Hoffmann observed in <i>Investors
    Compensation Scheme Ltd.</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at 115:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The meaning
    which a document (or any other utterance) would convey to a reasonable man is not
    the same thing as the meaning of its words.  The meaning of words is a matter of dictionaries and grammars;  the meaning of the document is what the
    parties using those words against the relevant background would reasonably have
    been understood to mean.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No doubt, the dictionary and grammatical meaning of the
    words (sometimes called the “plain meaning”) used by the parties will be
    important and often decisive in determining the meaning of the document.  However, the former cannot be equated with
    the latter.  The meaning of a document is
    derived not just from the words used, but from the context or the circumstances
    in which the words were used.  Professor
    John Swan puts it well in <i>Canadian
    Contract Law</i> (Markham, Ont.: Butterworths, 2006) at 493:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>There are a
    number of inherent features of language that need to be noted.  Few, if any words, can be understood apart
    from their context and no contractual language can be understood without some
    knowledge of its context and the purpose of the contract.  Words, taken individually, have an inherent
    vagueness that will often require courts to determine their meaning by looking
    at their context and the expectations that the parties may have had.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The text of the written agreement must be read as a
    whole and in the context of the circumstances as they existed when the
    agreement was created.  The circumstances
    include facts that were known or reasonably capable of being known by the
    parties when they entered into the written agreement:  see <i>BG
    Checo International Ltd. v. British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority</i>,
    [1993] 1 S.C.R. 12 at 23-24;  <i>H.W. Liebig &amp; Co. v. Leading Investments

    agreement was made is an integral part of the interpretative process and is not
    something that is resorted to only where the words viewed in isolation suggest
    some ambiguity.  To find ambiguity, one
    must come to certain conclusions as to the meaning of the words used.  A conclusion as to the meaning of words used
    in a written contract can only be properly reached if the contract is
    considered in the context in which it was made:  see McCamus, <i>The Law of Contracts</i> (Toronto:  Irwin Law, 2005) at 710-11.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In sharp
    contrast with civil legal systems the common law adopts a largely objective
    theory to the interpretation of contracts.  <u>The purpose of the interpretation of a contract is not to discover

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The context in which the written words used in this agreement
    must be understood begins with the parties who negotiated the agreement.  Both were sophisticated, experienced,
    successful businessmen who could reasonably be expected to negotiate a commercially
    sensible and workable agreement.  When
    they agreed to work together, it was anticipated that Dumbrell, whose expertise
    lay in finding commercial real estate projects, would investigate and, where
    appropriate, bring potentially profitable large-scale commercial developments
    to Regional.  Regional had the ability to
    finance and develop these projects.  It
    did so in various ways using whatever corporate vehicle Gordon deemed
    appropriate.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The agreement reached by the parties contemplated a
    relatively short working relationship of between six months and one year.  It also contemplated that Dumbrell would
    receive nothing unless he brought projects to Regional which earned profits for
    Regional.  If he did that, his
    compensation would be significant (fifty percent of the profits).  In tying Dumbrell’s compensation to profits as
    opposed to, for example, fees earned by Regional, the parties anticipated that
    Dumbrell’s entitlement to commissions would not be known until a project was
    complete and Regional’s net profit on the project could be determined.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given Regional’s business history, it could reasonably
    be anticipated when the employment agreement was made that when projects were
    brought to it by Dumbrell, Regional would be involved in various ways and that its
    involvement could yield profits through a variety of methods at different
    stages of Regional’s involvement in any given project.  On the findings made by the trial judge,
    Dumbrell was not taking employment with a company whose sole source of profits
    came through various forms of fees, but was taking employment with a company whose
    profits could come through various kinds of involvement in different projects.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    was made to the words used in the agreement and in particular the words used in
    Schedule “B”.  Schedule “B” begins by
    stating that Dumbrell’s remuneration will be based on his performance.  He must produce to be paid.  Schedule “B” then describes his remuneration
    as fifty percent of “profits” for each project. “Profits” are described in paras. 1(2) and 1(3).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paragraph 1(2) makes it clear that profits must be
    earned as a result of Dumbrell’s direct involvement in the project.  In addition, the project must be “completed
    and closed … in accordance with standard operating policy of the Corporation”.  The reference to “standard operating policy”
    is of no assistance as it is common ground that there was no such thing.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paragraph 1(2) sets out certain kinds of fees that are
    included in the meaning of profits, such as acquisition fees, development fees,
    and syndication fees.  The fees described
    in para. 1(2) are not an exhaustive list of the kinds of payments to Regional
    that can constitute profits.  Lastly,
    para. 1(2) refers to business activities which constitute projects for the
    purpose of the calculation of profits, including “Syndication projects”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paragraph 1(3) sets out a formula by which profits are
    to be determined by deducting certain expenses from “Gross Revenues”.  The reference in para. 1(3) to “Gross Revenues”
    and the types of expenses identified in that paragraph indicates two
    things.  First, the question of whether
    Regional earned any profit and, if so, the amount of that profit may well not be
    determined until the end of Regional’s involvement in a particular
    project.  Second, Regional’s involvement
    in projects could take forms other than a fee for service basis.  The reference to “Gross Revenues” and many of
    the expenses described in para. 1(3) are consistent with Regional taking equity
    positions in a project and realizing a profit upon a sale of that equity
    position.  </p>

    Dumbrell’s potential remuneration to projects that are completed and closed as
    of the date of termination of his employment contract.  The context in which the contract was made
    contraindicates imposing any such limitation on profits.  Reasonable people in the position of Dumbrell
    and Gordon would have appreciated that Regional’s involvement in the kind of complex
    large scale commercial projects that it was anticipated Dumbrell would bring to
    it may well not be completed within the relatively short time span contemplated
    by the employment contract.  Similarly,
    the method used for calculating Dumbrell’s compensation by reference to profit
    as calculated in para. 1(3) contemplates that the projects could well extend
    over a considerable period of time with the ultimate determination of whether
    any profit was made and, therefore, any remuneration owed to Dumbrell being
    based on events that occurred well after the relatively brief period of
    employment contemplated by the agreement.  On my reading of Schedule “B”, Dumbrell was entitled to fifty percent of
    Regional’s profits even if the profits were made after the employment contract
    was terminated.  </p>

    profits for the purpose of calculating Dumbrell’s compensation.  The first part of the termination clause
    speaks to the point at which the contractual relationship ends.  It does not purport to terminate obligations
    that existed under the contract when the contract came to an end.  If, as I would hold, profits as defined in
    Schedule “B” include profits earned and calculated after the termination of the
    contract, the obligation to pay those profits, when and if they arise, is an
    obligation that exists under the contract as of the date of termination albeit
    in an inchoate form. </p>

    answers one of the arguments relied on by the appellants.  They submitted that a definition of profits
    that included profits made after the termination date of the contract would create
    indefinite and potentially open-ended liability by Regional to Dumbrell for
    profits earned on projects many years down the road.  The limitation provision in the termination
    clause excludes any claim by Dumbrell that is not advanced within one year of
    the termination of the contract.  This
    provision effectively places limits on Regional’s potential liability to
    Dumbrell.  As it happens, the limitation
    clause does not assist Regional here because Dumbrell had commenced his action
    within the one year period.</p>

    cannot agree with this analysis.  To the
    extent that the syndicate was owned by third parties who genuinely invested
    funds in the project, I do not see how profits payable to those investors can
    become the profits of Regional for the purposes of calculating Dumbrell’s
    compensation.  The accounting records do
    provide evidence that 26.67 percent of the profit realized on the sale of the
    twenty-five percent interest in the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">

    the

    liable for breach of contract.  She spoke
    of “piercing the corporate veil” and described Regional as Gordon’s agent for

    she found both Regional and Gordon liable for breaching the contract.  I agree with Mr. Zarnett’s submission that if
    Regional acted as Gordon’s agent for the purposes of the contract, only Gordon
    could be liable for breaching that contract.  The trial judge’s finding that Regional was liable along with Gordon for
    breaching the contract was also inconsistent with the trial judge’s conclusion,
    at para. 187, that she should “pierce the corporate veil” and hold Gordon
    liable.  Either Regional had a separate

    however, in different ways.  The agency relationship

    inserted into a transaction for a fraudulent or dishonest purpose.  Corporations used in that way often have no
    assets, no corporate history, and no reason for existence other than facilitating
    a particular transaction.  None of those
    indicia apply to Regional.  Regional
    cannot be described as a shell or corporation of convenience put in place by
    Gordon for the purpose of entering into the contract with Dumbrell.  As of November 1998, Regional had been a
    thriving well established corporate entity for many years.  It participated in many different real estate
    transactions and employed many people.  Dumbrell
    chose to become one of those employees.  There is no suggestion in the evidence that the creation of the
    employer/employee relationship between Regional and Dumbrell was tainted by
    fraud or dishonesty on the part of Gordon.  There is simply nothing to suggest that Gordon set out to deceive or
    trick Dumbrell when he and Dumbrell negotiated the employment contract which
    created the contractual relationship between Dumbrell and Regional, and not
    between Dumbrell and Gordon.  Dumbrell

    not depend on what part of the profits Regional described as fees.  Had Gordon chosen to describe some of the
    profits generated for the syndicate from the sale of its interests as fees
    payable to Regional, it would not have increased the overall profit earned by
