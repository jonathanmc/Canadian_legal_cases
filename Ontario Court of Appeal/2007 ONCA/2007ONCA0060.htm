    is yet another case where a routine interaction between a police officer and an
    individual gives rise to a difficult constitutional question requiring the
    court to balance individual constitutional rights against the public interest
    in effective law enforcement.  Viewed
    from one perspective, the police officer’s actions were exactly what the
    community would expect of him.  He
    responded quickly to a victim’s request for police assistance, followed up on
    his reasonable suspicions once he arrived at the scene of the crime, treated
    the appellant in a professional and even-handed manner, and in the end caught a
    criminal.  From another perspective, the
    appellant was not treated fairly.  While
    under police detention, he was effectively invited by the police officer’s
    questions to implicate himself in a crime without first being told of his right
    to obtain legal assistance and without being afforded the opportunity to obtain
    that assistance, if he so desired.  </span></p>

    crime (a $100 LCBO gift certificate), one count of possession of a stolen credit

    ninety days to be followed by probation for one year.  </span></p>

    sentence.  In keeping with this court’s

    the conviction appeal, the appellant submits that his right to be informed of
    his right to counsel under s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter</i> was denied during a brief investigative detention.  He contends that his statements made during
    that detention, his statements made after his arrest which immediately followed
    his detention, and evidence seized from him after his arrest should have been
    excluded under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  The appellant contends that without these
    statements and the evidence seized from him, he would not have been
    convicted.  </span></p>

    the sentence appeal, the appellant argues that the trial judge erred in law in
    not imposing an intermittent sentence.  It is the appellant’s contention that as the Crown was not opposed to an
    intermittent sentence, the trial judge was obliged to treat the appellant’s
    request for an intermittent sentence as a joint submission once he decided to
    impose a sentence of ninety days or less.  </span></p>

    Crown submits that there was no violation of s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter</i> and alternatively, that if there
    was a violation, neither the statements made to the police after arrest nor the
    evidence seized from the appellant should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  The Crown contends that apart from the statements made by the appellant
    during his brief investigative detention, the case against the appellant was
    overwhelming.  </span></p>

    was not advised of his right to counsel “without delay”.  There was no breach of s. 10(b) and the

    legal issue raised on this appeal arises out of a prosaic fact situation.  A police officer briefly detained the
    appellant for investigative purposes and questioned him without advising him of
    his right to counsel.  The police officer
    received additional information from another officer and then arrested the
    appellant, advised him of his right to counsel, questioned him, and searched
    his person and his purse.  The appellant
    gave incriminating answers to the questions asked by the officer both before
    and after his arrest.  The material
    seized from the appellant also implicated him in the offences.  </span></p>

    was the Crown’s position that the appellant and an accomplice named William Erhirhie
    obtained a stolen credit card and debit card belonging to Sarbjit Brar.  The Crown contended that they used the cards

    Belleville,

    employee at the Cobourg LCBO testified that she and other employees had been
    warned to be on the lookout for two men using $100 gift certificates to
    purchase items.  A man (Erhirhie) came
    into the store and attempted to purchase a $3 bottle of beer with a $100 gift
    certificate.  The employee went into the
    back room and advised another employee to call the police.  She then returned to the counter and
    attempted to delay the man until the police arrived.  A second man, the appellant, approached and
    asked her what was taking so long.  After
    a short wait, the appellant told the employee that they would pay cash for the
    bottle of beer and asked her to return the gift certificate to him.  At this juncture, the police arrived.  Erhirhie was questioned at the store counter
    by Officer Bellemare, the first police officer to enter the store.  </span></p>

    with Erhirhie.  There were other people
    in the store.  Constable Roughley saw the
    appellant walk toward the door from the vicinity where Constable Bellemare was
    standing with Erhirhie.  As the appellant

    and was getting into the driver’s side of a van when Constable Roughley said,

    before you go anywhere.”  Constable
    Roughley testified that he did not want the appellant to leave the area because
    he was uncertain whether the appellant was involved in the incident in the

    radio that the two suspects who had used the stolen credit card to purchase the
    gift certificates at the LCBO in Belleville earlier were driving a red Pontiac
    Montana van.  Constable Roughley was also
    given the licence plate number of that van.  The description of the vehicle and the licence plate number matched the appellant’s
    vehicle.  </span></p>

    documents for the vehicle.  While the
    appellant was retrieving the ownership documents, Constable Roughley looked
    inside the vehicle.  The officer noticed
    an LCBO bag with liquor inside.  He also
    saw some Wal-Mart bags sitting between the front seats, and several boxes that

    the basis for the arrest was the appellant’s statement to him that he had
    driven to the LCBO with the person who Constable Roughley believed had tried to
    use a stolen credit card in the store.    </span></p>

    Roughley told the appellant that he was under arrest for fraud.  The appellant interrupted him and according
    to Constable Roughley said, “It wasn’t him it was his friend”.  Constable Roughley then asked who owned “all
    of the stuff” that was in the car and Constable Roughley testified that the
    appellant replied, “some of it was his [the appellant’s] and some of it was the
    other fella’s inside the store”.  </span></p>

    appellant indicated that he did and then added, “<span class=GramE>but</span> if he says it was just him can I go”.  Constable
    Roughley told him to just listen and he read him his rights to counsel.  He asked the appellant whether he wished to

    the comments in <i>R. v. Mann</i>, <i>supra</i>, concerning s. 10(b), those
    comments suggest that s. 10(b) may be engaged in investigative detentions where

    10(b) cannot apply to investigative detentions is the language of s. 10(b)
    itself.  Section 10(b) does not qualify
    the word “detention”.  The section
    applies to all detentions.  However narrowly
    one chooses to define the word “detention”, there will be circumstances where individuals
    are detained for investigative purposes.  For example, some investigative detentions may involve the brief physical
    restraint of individuals.  To suggest
    that individuals under physical restraint are not detained and are not entitled
    to be informed of their right to counsel because their restraint is
    characterized as an investigative detention rather than an arrest, is, in my
    view, to draw a distinction which has no basis in the language of s. 10(b) or
    in the purposes underlying that section.  Once it is acknowledged that a person is detained by the police, whether
    that detention is an arrest or an investigative detention, then s. 10(b) must
    be engaged subject to s. 1 of the <i>Charter</i>.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span

    officers are authorized to detain persons for investigative purposes where

    detention for investigative purposes must be a reasonable detention based on
    all of the circumstances and must be conducted in a reasonable manner.  Investigative concerns will usually justify
    only a brief detention following which the officer will either have to release
    the individual or, if reasonable and probable grounds exist, arrest the individual.  Investigative detention is not an arrest and

    is an obvious tension between the requirement to inform detained persons of
    their right to counsel and the proper and effective use of brief investigative
    detentions.  Not only will most investigative
    detentions justify only a brief detention of the individual, most will occur
    “on the street” in dynamic and quickly evolving situations.  The police must move quickly in these
    situations to react to the circumstances as they change and to new information
    as it becomes available.  If the police
    are obliged to advise every person detained for investigative purposes of their
    right to counsel before asking any potentially incriminating questions, the
    police are presumably required to stop any questioning and facilitate contact
    with counsel if the detained person chooses to exercise his or her right to
    counsel.  The delay inherent in this
    process, not to mention the redirection of police resources that would be
    required to comply with requests to consult with counsel, would render the
    police power to briefly detain persons for investigative purposes in aid of
    criminal investigations largely illusory.  </span></p>

    addition to the negative impact on the ability of the police to effectively
    investigate crimes, a requirement that the police advise detained persons of the
    right to counsel immediately could seriously impair the liberty interests of
    detained persons.  If the police are
    required to advise a person detained briefly for investigative purposes of his
    or her right to counsel before asking any questions and if the person exercises
    that right, the detention of that person will potentially be considerably
    longer than it would otherwise have been.  The police may also be required to take the person into physical custody
    to transport that person to another location where he or she can effectively
    exercise the right to counsel.  These
    lengthier detentions, accompanied in some cases by transportation to another location
    while in physical custody, could also necessitate personal searches of the
    detained persons that would not be appropriate in the context of a brief
    investigative detention.  The
    interpretation of s. 10(b) urged by counsel for the appellant in the context of
    brief investigative detentions would inevitably result in significant
    additional interference with the liberty and personal security of those

    individuals for investigative purposes and the right of those individuals to be
    advised of the right to counsel must begin with a consideration of the purposes
    that underlie the rights guaranteed by s. 10(b).  In <i>R.
    v. Bartle</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 300-301,
    Lamer C.J.C. identifies two purposes animating the police obligation to advise
    detained persons of their right to counsel.  First, advising detained persons that they are entitled to speak with a
    lawyer gives them the opportunity to obtain legal advice about their rights
    while under police detention, particularly their right against self-incrimination
    and their right to silence.  Second,
    requiring the police to advise detained persons of their right to counsel
    facilitates access to legal advice to assist detained persons in regaining
    their liberty as quickly as possible.    </span></p>

    first of these two purposes – to advise detained persons of their rights – is
    operative in the context of a routine investigative detention.  Persons who are detained for investigative
    purposes are usually questioned.  Often,
    questions asked in the context of a routine investigative detention, even
    exploratory questions like those asked by Constable Roughley, may have an
    incriminatory potential.  Access to legal
    advice in the course of an investigatory detention would give the detainee some
    protection against the risk of self-incrimination.  That protection would, however, come with a
    significant cost.</span></p>

    their right to counsel – to assist those persons in regaining their liberty – will
    often not be served by requiring that individuals subject to brief
    investigative detentions be advised of their right to counsel.  To the contrary, as indicated above, a person
    who is under investigative detention and who after being advised of his or her right
    to counsel chooses to exercise that right, will almost inevitably end up
    suffering a longer detention and more intrusive state conduct than he or she would
    otherwise have endured.  Iacobucci J. in <i>R. v. Mann</i>, <i>supra</i>, recognized the potential negative impact on the detained
    person’s liberty when he cautioned against using s. 10(b) to artificially
    prolong investigative detentions.  </span></p>

    physical restraint, a personal search, and will usually involve moving the
    detainee to a jail.  That detention will
    not be brief and will significantly interfere with the detainee’s liberty and
    security of the person.  Advising an
    arrested person of his or her right to counsel will not usually prolong the
    detention.  An arrested person is also
    obviously in need of immediate advice as to his or her rights while in
    detention.  The concern that detained

    my view, a brief interlude between the commencement of an investigative detention
    and the advising of the detained person’s right to counsel under s. 10(b) during
    which the officer makes a quick assessment of the situation to decide whether
    anything more than a brief detention of the individual may be warranted, is not
    inconsistent with the requirement that a detained person be advised of his or
    her right to counsel “without delay”.  Allowing
    the police a brief opportunity to size up the situation and the detainee’s
    status is consistent with the concern expressed by Iacobucci J. in <i>R. v. Mann</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 22 where he observed:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>Like every other provision of the <i>Charter</i>, s. 10(b) must be purposively
    interpreted.  Mandatory compliance with
    its requirements cannot be transformed into an excuse for prolonging, unduly and
    artificially, a detention that, as I later mention, must be of brief duration.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Acknowledging
    that there can be a brief time span between an initial detention for
    investigative purposes and the administration of the s. 10(b) rights also reflects
    the nature of the vast majority of investigative detentions.  Like the detention in this case, most
    investigative detentions are the result of “psychological compulsion” and not
    physical restraint.  It is often
    difficult to tell exactly when in the course of a dynamic interchange between
    the police and an individual that a detention based on psychological compulsion
    begins.  In some cases, the nature of the
    questions put to the person by the officer and that person’s responses to those
    questions will be relevant in determining whether there was a psychological detention:  see <i>R.
    v. Grant</i>, <i>supra</i>.  It seems highly artificial to select an
    arbitrary point in what is a fluid encounter and declare that from that point
    forward the person was detained and the next words out of the officer’s mouth
    should have been advice as to the person’s right to counsel. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally,
    and again most importantly, I see nothing in the phrase “without delay” which
    precludes the interpretation I would place on s. 10(b) insofar as investigative
    detentions are concerned.  The words
    “without delay” are semantically capable of a broader meaning than
    “immediately” in the appropriate context:  see <i>R. v. Kelly</i> (1985), 17
    C.C.C. (3d) 419 at 424 (Ont.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    interpreting the words “without delay” somewhat more expansively in the context
    of investigative detentions than in the context of arrest, I do not mean to
    read s. 10(b) out of police/citizen encounters that do not progress past the
    investigative detention stage.  The time
    limit imposed by the words “without delay” is of necessity a tight one and can
    accommodate only brief interludes between commencing an investigative detention
    and advising the detained person of his or her right to counsel.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    police activity during the brief interlude contemplated by the words “without
    delay” must be truly exploratory in that the officer must be trying to decide
    whether anything beyond a brief detention of the person will be necessary and
    justified.  If the officer has already
    made up his or her mind that the detained person will be detained for something
    more than a brief interval, there is no justification for not providing the
    individual with his or her right to counsel immediately.  To echo the words of <i>R. v. Mann</i>, <i>supra</i>, in
    those cases, the investigative detention is a <i>de facto</i> arrest.  For
    example, in <i>R. v. Greaves</i>, <i>supra</i>, what was ostensibly an
    investigative detention went on for over half an hour.  Clearly a delay of that length is beyond the
    limits of the “without delay” requirement.    </span></p>

    conclusion that the phrase “without delay” is sufficiently flexible to
    encompass a brief passage of time between an initial investigative detention
    and an officer advising a detained person of his or her right to counsel.  The decision of MacDonnell J. in <i>R. v. Hall</i>, [1998] O.J. No. 2607 (Ct. J.),
    offers some support for my conclusion.  In <i>R. v. Hall</i>, the accused was
    stopped for a highway traffic violation.  The officer noticed a suspicious looking cigarette on the ashtray of the
    appellant’s vehicle.  He asked Mr. Hall
    what was in the ashtray and Mr. Hall candidly responded, “Just a little weed.”  It was argued that the police officer was
    required to advise Mr. Hall of his right to counsel before asking him what was
    in the ashtray.  </span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span

    the side of Mr. Hall’s car, he observed the handrolled cigarette in the

    been possible to recite the right to counsel at that point.  However, the only investigation that Clayton knew
    he was conducting at that moment was a Highway Traffic Act investigation into
    Mr. Hall’s conduct in proceeding through a stop sign.  That was the matter for which Mr. Hall had
    been stopped and for which he was being detained.  It was also a matter with respect to which
    the right to counsel has limited, if any, utility.  While Clayton’s professional curiosity was no
    doubt stimulated when he saw the cigarette, it would not be reasonable to
    suggest that upon seeing it he immediately became engaged in the investigation
    of a narcotics offence.  <span

    concerning the same offence for which he had been detained.  However, like the questions in <i>R. v. Hall</i>, <i>supra</i>, Constable Roughley’s questions were cursory and
    preliminary.  He wanted to determine whether
    there was any need to detain the appellant beyond the very brief detention which

    appellant immediately when Constable Roughley arrived at the car and that
    Constable Roughley received the additional information pertaining to the
    vehicle immediately after the appellant had answered the few questions put to
    him by Constable Roughley.  It seems a
    safe inference that the passage of time between the start of the detention and

    statements could not be excluded under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i> as on my interpretation of the phrase “without delay” there
    is no breach of s. 10(b).  An accused
    could, however, argue that the admission of the incriminatory statements made
    before he was advised of his right to counsel would render his trial unfair if
    those statements were received for any purpose other than to explain subsequent
    police conduct:  see <i>R. v. Harrer</i> (1995), 101 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.), La Forest J.
