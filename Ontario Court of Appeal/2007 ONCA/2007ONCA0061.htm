  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>A.            Overview</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal and the companion appeal, <i>Kingsway General
    Insurance Company v. Ontario (Minister of Finance)</i>, concern the status of
    the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund in the process for resolving disputes
    over the payment of statutory accident benefits to persons injured in car
    accidents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All Ontario residents, and in some circumstances,
    non-residents, injured in a car accident in this province are entitled to
    accident benefits.  Accident benefits,
    or no-fault benefits as they are sometimes called, typically include payments
    for income replacement, rehabilitation and other medical expenses, funeral expenses,
    and death benefits.  For cases where an
    injured person may claim accident benefits under more than one policy of
    insurance, section 268(2) of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.I.8 sets
    out priority rules establishing which insurer must pay.  If no insurance is available, the injured
    person may claim benefits from the statutorily-created Fund.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Disputes between insurers – where liability for the payment of
    accident benefits is unclear – are governed by O. Reg. 283/95.  Pending the resolution of any dispute, the
    regulation requires that the first insurer to receive a claim for benefits must
    pay.  This requirement ensures that
    accident victims receive benefits promptly.  Disputes over payment must then be resolved by arbitration under the <i>Arbitration
    Act</i>, <i>1991</i>, S.O. 1991, c.17. The principal issue on these two appeals
    is whether the Fund is an “insurer” under regulation 283.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this appeal, the Fund paid benefits to the family of an
    accident victim, and sought reimbursement either from Allstate Insurance
    Company of Canada or Manitoba Public Insurance.  Both insurers denied coverage.  The Fund then commenced arbitration.  Allstate objected to the arbitrator’s jurisdiction on the ground that
    the Fund was not an insurer.  The
    arbitrator concluded that he had jurisdiction and held that Allstate was liable
    for the accident benefits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, however, Ferguson J. set aside the arbitrator’s
    award for lack of jurisdiction.  He
    concluded that he was bound by this court’s decision in <i>Kalinkine v. Ontario
    (Superintendent of Financial Services)</i>, [2004] O.J. No. 5138, which said
    that the Fund was not an insurer under regulation 283.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Fund appeals<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a> and asks to reinstate the arbitrator’s award.  It says that it is not an insurer but contends that it can either resort
    to arbitration under regulation 283 or seek restitution in the courts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent, Allstate, says that the Fund cannot have it
    both ways.  If it is not an insurer, it
    cannot seek arbitration under the regulation; if it is an insurer, it can
    resort to arbitration but must comply with all provisions of regulation
    283.  As the Fund did not commence the
    arbitration within the time prescribed by the regulation, its claim for
    reimbursement must fail. Therefore, whether an insurer or not, Allstate
    contends that the Fund’s appeal should be dismissed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In both this appeal and the companion <i>Kingsway</i> appeal,
    the parties asked us to consider the correctness of <i>Kalinkine</i>.  Therefore, in accordance with this court’s
    well- established practice, we convened a panel of five judges to hear these
    two appeals.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>B.            Background</span></h4>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>            (i)             The
    Facts</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    November 19, 2002, Sandra Mattinas was killed in a two-car accident on Highway
    11 near Hearst, Ontario.  One of the
    cars was insured by Manitoba Public Insurance.  The other car, in which Ms. Mattinas was a passenger, was
    uninsured.  At the time of the accident,
    Ms. Mattinas had two young children and lived with her mother, Rita Mattinas,
    who had a valid policy of insurance with Allstate.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    July 25, 2003, Rita Mattinas applied to the Fund for death and funeral benefits
    under the <i>Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule</i>, O. Reg. 403/96.  The Fund paid $20,202 to the Mattinas
    family.  It then sought reimbursement
    from either Allstate or Manitoba Public Insurance.  In August and September 2003, the Fund put each insurer on notice
    of a priority dispute.  Although all
    parties agree that the Fund was entitled to recover from one insurer or the
    other, each insurer denied liability.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    November 2004, over a year after having given notice of the dispute, the Fund
    served both insurers with a notice of commencement of arbitration under the <i>Arbitration
    Act, 1991</i>.  The notice referred to
    the following passage from Kennedy J. in <i>Ontario (Minister of Finance) v.
    ING Halifax</i> (2003), 15 C.C.L.I. (4<sup>th</sup>) 281 (Ont. Sup. Ct.) on the
    right of the Fund to use the arbitration provisions of regulations 283:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>It
    is clear in law that the Fund is not an insurer, but does pay accident benefits
    when there is no insurance.  The
    Regulation is mandatory for insurers but permits the Fund to avail itself of
    the dispute resolution process to efficiently determine priorities and (if
    necessary) claim repayment of accident benefits.  The regulation does not oust the Fund’s substantive rights to
    claim restitution either directly or by implication.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Arbitration</span></h4>

    Freedman, an experienced personal injuries lawyer, conducted the
    arbitration.  He dismissed Allstate’s
    preliminary jurisdictional objection, and held that because he was asked to
    decide a priority dispute between two insurers, he had jurisdiction under the
    regulation.  He also noted that the
    insurers had withdrawn their objection that the Fund did not institute
    arbitration proceedings within the one-year period prescribed by section 7 of
    the regulation.  According to the
    arbitrator “it was conceded that the Fund was not bound by the time limits set
    in the regulation.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    arbitrator then turned to the merits of the dispute between Allstate and
    Manitoba Public Insurance.  He found
    that “at the time of her death, Sandra Mattinas was principally dependent for financial
    support” on her mother, Rita Mattinas.  Therefore, Ms. Mattinas was an insured person under her mother’s
    policy.  Rita Mattinas’ insurer,
    Allstate, was thus obliged to reimburse the Fund.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Appeal Decision of Ferguson J.</span></h3>

    the arbitration began, all parties agreed that each could appeal from the
    arbitrator’s award on a question of law or mixed fact and law.  Allstate appealed both the arbitrator’s
    holding on his jurisdiction and his finding of dependency.  Ferguson J. dealt only with the issue of
    jurisdiction.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>He
    concluded, correctly in my view, that he was bound to apply this court’s
    holding in </span><i>Kalinkine</i>.  As <i>Kalinkine</i> had held that the Fund was not an insurer under the regulation, Ferguson J.
    concluded that Allstate was not required to submit to an arbitration initiated
    by the Fund.  Accordingly, he set aside
    the arbitrator’s award.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having so concluded, however, Ferguson J. then
    explained why he disagreed with this court’s holding in <i>Kalinkine</i>.  In his opinion, although regulation 283 was not
    well- drafted, properly interpreted the term “insurer” included the Fund.  He gave four reasons for his opinion:</p>

    overall scheme for paying accident benefits contemplates the Fund being treated
    as an insurer for the purpose of determining who should pay the benefits, which

    Fund was established under the <i>Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Act</i>.  It is largely financed through fees paid by
    licensed Ontario drivers.  As is evident
    from the priority rules under the <i>Insurance Act</i>, a principal purpose of
    the Fund is to alleviate financial hardship for persons who are injured in a
    car accident and who have no recourse to any insurance policy for the payment
    of accident benefits.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

    6(1) of the <i>Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Act</i> states that a person who
    has recourse against the Fund for the payment of accident benefits under
    section 268 of the <i>Insurance Act</i> may apply to the Superintendent of
    Insurance for the payment of benefits out of the Fund.  Importantly, if a person does have recourse
    against the Fund, then section 6(2)(a) of the Act deems any reference to
    “insurer” in the <i>Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule</i> to be a reference
    to the Fund.  Section 6(2)(a) provides: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>If
    a person has recourse against the Fund under section 268 of the <i>Insurance
    Act</i>, </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(a)

    Reg. 283/95 came into effect in May 1995.  As with many regulations concerning automobile insurance, this
    regulation was passed after consultation with the insurance industry.  The regulation, which is titled “Disputes
    Between Insurers,” governs the resolution of disputes over which insurer is
    required to pay accident benefits under section 268 of the <i>Insurance Act</i>.  Section 1 of the regulation makes the
    dispute resolution process under the regulation mandatory:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>All
    disputes as to which insurer is required to pay benefits under section 268 of
    the Act shall be settled in accordance with this Regulation.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    regulation has two main purposes.  The
    first purpose is to ensure that injured persons receive accident benefits
    promptly, despite any disputes between insurers over who should pay these
    benefits.  Section 2 of the regulation
    provides that the first insurer to receive an application for accident benefits
    must pay pending resolution of any dispute over its liability to do so:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    first insurer that receives a completed application for benefits is responsible
    for paying benefits to an insured person pending the resolution of any dispute
    as to which insurer is required to pay benefits under section 268 of the Act.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    second main purpose of the regulation is to provide for the resolution of
    insurer disputes by arbitration under the <i>Arbitration</i> <i>Act</i>, <i>1991</i>.   Previously these disputes were resolved by
    the Ontario Insurance Commission.  Under
    section 7(1) of the regulation, they are now to be resolved by private
    arbitration:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>If
    the insurers cannot agree as to who is required to pay benefits or if the
    insured person disagrees with an agreement among insurers that an insurer other
    than the insurer selected by the insured person should pay the benefits, the
    dispute shall be resolved through an arbitration under the <i>Arbitration Act</i>,<i> 1991</i>.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Under
    section 7(2), either an insurer paying benefits under section 2, any other
    insurer alleged to be liable for these benefits or, in certain circumstances,
    an insured person, can initiate an arbitration.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The regulation
    imposes time limits for disputing liability to pay benefits and initiating
    arbitration.  Under section 3(1), an
    insurer wishing to dispute its obligation to pay benefits, must give notice to
    every other insurer alleged to be liable within 90 days of receiving an
    application for benefits.  Under section
    3(2), the 90-day period may be extended if certain conditions are met.  Under section 7(2), “no arbitration may be
    initiated after one year from the time the insurer paying benefits under
    section 2 first gives notice under section 3.”  Arbitration and the time limits for initiating it are intended to ensure
    the prompt and cost-effective resolution of disputes over payment.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    contrast to section 6(2) of the <i>Motor</i> <i>Vehicle</i> <i>Accident</i> <i>Claims</i> <i>Act</i>, there is no provision in regulation 283 deeming the Fund to be an
    insurer for the purpose of resolving disputes over the payment of accident
    benefits.  The Fund, however, is
    expressly included in the resolution process.  Section 11 of the regulation addresses the situation where the Fund
    receives an application for accident benefits:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>If
    the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund receives an application for benefits,
    sections 4 and 5 do not apply and the insured person is not entitled to
    initiate or participate as a party in an arbitration under section 7.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section
    4 provides that “an insurer that gives notice under section 3 shall also give
    notice to the insured person.”  Section
    5 addresses the insured person’s response to the notice under section 4.  Therefore, under section 11, if the Fund
    receives an application for benefits, the insured is not entitled to
    participate in any dispute over who should pay the benefits.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

    regard to this statutory and regulatory scheme for the payment of accident
    benefits and for resolving disputes over who should pay them, I turn to this
    court’s decision in </span><i>Kalinkine</i> and to the main issue on the
    appeal: whether the Fund is an insurer under regulation 283.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>D.            Analysis</span></h4>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>            (i)            This
    Court’s Decision in </span><i>Kalinkine</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In </span><i>Kalinkine</i>,
    this court was faced with the converse of the issue on the two appeals before
    us.  In <i>Kalinkine</i> the issue was
    not whether the Fund was an insurer under regulation 283, but whether the Fund
    could sue in the courts to recover from an insurer benefits it had paid to an
    accident victim.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The facts in <i>Kalinkine</i> were unusual.  The insurer, The Personal Insurance Company
    of Canada, did not dispute its obligation to pay benefits or the amount that it
    was required to pay.  Instead – at odds
    with Allstate’s position in this appeal and contrary to Kingsway’s position in
    the companion appeal – Personal asserted that the Fund was bound by the
    mandatory arbitration provisions of regulation 283.  The motion judge, Tulloch J., disagreed.  He held that the Fund was entitled to seek restitution
    in the court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In a brief endorsement, this court dismissed Personal’s
    appeal.  The panel gave two reasons: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>First,
    s. 1 of the Regulation establishes that it applies only to “insurers” that are
    required to pay [Statutory Accident Benefits] under s. 268 of the <i>Insurance
    Act</i>.  The Fund is not an “insurer”
    for the purpose of the <i>Insurance Act</i> or the Regulation. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Second,
    and in any event, nothing in the Regulation purports to remove the Fund’s right
    to seek restitution through the courts in a proper case. … Section 11 affects
    the rights of insured persons in defined circumstances, not the substantive
    rights of the Fund.</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>In the appeal before us, although disagreeing with <i>Kalinkine</i>, the
    appeal court judge applied its reasoning and set aside the arbitrator’s award.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>            (ii)            Is
    the Fund an Insurer Under O. Reg. 283/95?</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> This is the central question on this
    appeal.  The Fund submits that it is not
    an insurer.  It contends, however, that
    where it has a dispute with a licensed insurer over the payment of accident
    benefits, it can either initiate arbitration under regulation 283 or sue for
    restitution in the courts.  In my view,
    that contention is not tenable.  Both
    its title and section 1 stipulate that the regulation applies to disputes
    between “insurers.”  Under section 7(2)
    of the regulation, only an “insurer” can initiate arbitration.  Thus, I think that Allstate’s position on
    this appeal is correct: either the Fund is an insurer under the regulation and
    bound by all its provisions, or it is not an insurer and cannot take advantage
    of any of the provisions of the regulation.  If it is an insurer, it must arbitrate, not litigate, any dispute.  If it is not an insurer, absent any agreement
    to arbitrate, it must litigate disputes with licensed insurers over the payment
    of accident benefits.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For
    reasons I will outline, I have concluded that the Fund is an insurer under
    regulation 283.  It must arbitrate
    disputes over the payment of accident benefits, and in doing so, is bound by
    all the provisions of the regulation.  I
    have also concluded that in the rare case, such as <i>Kalinkine</i> itself, where there is no dispute to be arbitrated, the
    Fund may sue for restitution in the courts.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Whether
    the Fund is an insurer under regulation 283 is a question of
    interpretation.  The principles of
    statutory interpretation are well established.  I take those same principles to apply to the interpretation of a
    regulation made under a statute.  To
    quote the principle of statutory interpretation repeatedly cited by the Supreme
    Court of Canada, the word “insurer” must “be read in [its] entire context and
    in [its] grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme” and
    object of the regulation, and the intention of the Lieutenant
    Governor-in-Council.  The “entire
    context” includes the regulation’s enabling statute, the <i>Insurance Act</i>,
    and the other relevant legislation, the <i>Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Act</i>.  See for example <i>Rizzo and Rizzo</i> <i>Shoes
    Ltd.</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27 at para. 21; <i>Chieu v. Canada (Minister of
    Citizenship and Immigration)</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 84 at para. 27; <i>Bell
    ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559 at para. 26 and <i>Re
    Canada 3000 Inc.</i>, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 865 at para. 36.  The court presumes that the statutory and
    regulatory provisions work together.  See
    Ruth Sullivan, <i>Sullivan and Driedger on the Construction of Statutes</i>, 4<sup>th</sup> ed. (Markham: Butterworths, 2002) at 272, 282-283.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Literally,
    of course, the Fund is not an insurer. “Insurer” is defined in the <i>Insurance</i> <i>Act</i> to mean a
    “person who undertakes or agrees or offers to undertake a contract.”  The Fund does not meet this definition.  However, in the interpretation of statutes
    or regulations, the literal or ordinary meaning of a word is not always
    determinative.  See <i>Chieu</i>,<i> supra</i>, at para. 34.  That is because
    its meaning flows, at least partly, from the statute’s, or in this case the
    regulation’s, context and purpose.  Interpreted in this light, I conclude that the Fund is an insurer for
    the purpose of resolving disputes over the payment of accident benefits.  Both the overall context and purpose of the
    legislative and regulatory scheme, and the immediate context, the wording of
    regulation 283, support this conclusion.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>(a) The Overall Context and Purpose</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section
    268 of the <i>Insurance</i> <i>Act</i>, section 6(2) of the <i>Motor</i> <i>Vehicle</i> <i>Accident</i> <i>Claims</i> <i>Act</i> and O. Reg. 283/95 comprise an
    integrated legislative and regulatory scheme for the payment of accident
    benefits.  The Fund plays a vital,
    indeed an essential role in that scheme.  It is liable for accident benefits when an accident victim has no
    recourse to a policy of insurance.  It
    is deemed to be an insurer for the purpose of paying those accident
    benefits.  Yet, as this case and the companion
    Kingsway appeal demonstrate, inevitably there will be disputes between the Fund
    and other insurers over who is liable to pay.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To say
    that the Fund is an insurer when it pays benefits, but not when it disputes its
    liability to pay them, runs directly contrary to the main purposes of the
    scheme: the prompt delivery of accident benefits to injured persons and the
    timely and cost-efficient resolution of disputes over who should pay those
    benefits.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Putting
    the Fund outside the dispute resolution provisions of regulation 283 so that it
    must either sue an insurer or be sued by an insurer in the courts makes little
    sense.  I cannot think that either the
    insurance industry, which was consulted on this regulation, or the Lieutenant
    Governor-in-Council who passed it, intended such a result.  </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>(b) The
    Immediate Context: The Wording of Regulation 283/95</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    provisions of regulation 283 expressly include the Fund.  Section 11 addresses the cases where the
    Fund receives an application for benefits and states that in those cases “the
    insured person is not entitled to initiate or participate as a party in an
    arbitration under section 7.”  Section
    11 is important in supporting the conclusion that the Fund is an insurer under
    the regulation for at least three reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
    as the appeal court judge said at para. 49 “[i]f the mandatory arbitration
    process prescribed by Regulation 283 did not apply when the Fund has paid
    benefits there would be no reason to include this section in the
    Regulation.”  In other words, if the
    Fund has no role in the dispute resolution under the regulation, section 11 would
    be unnecessary.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
    in cases where the Fund does receive an application for benefits, section 11
    contemplates arbitration to resolve any dispute between the Fund and one or
    more insurers over liability for those benefits.  Moreover, section 11 contemplates that the Fund will initiate
    that arbitration.  I say that because
    presumably, if the Fund receives an application for benefits, consistent with
    its obligation to pay accident victims promptly, it will do what it did in the
    present case: pay the benefits and then dispute its obligation to do so.  Under section 11, that dispute is to be
    resolved by arbitration under the regulation.  But, under section 3 of the regulation, only an insurer can give notice
    of a dispute, and under section 7(2) only an insurer can initiate
    arbitration.  Thus, to dispute its
    liability and to initiate arbitration, the Fund must be treated as an insurer.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third,
    sections 3, 4 and 11 of the regulation work together only if the Fund is
    considered an insurer.  If an insurer
    receiving an application for benefits under section 2 wishes to dispute its
    obligation to pay, then under section 3 it must give notice of that dispute to
    every insurer it alleges is liable.  Under section 4, “[a]n insurer that gives notice under section 3 shall
    also give notice to the insured person.”  Section 11, however, stipulates that section 4 does not apply where the
    Fund receives an application for benefits.  Implicitly then, section 3 does apply.  Thus, when the Fund receives an application for benefits and wishes to
    dispute its obligation to pay, it must give the section 3 notice but not the
    section 4 notice.  But the section 3
    notice, as I have said, is a notice required to be given by an insurer.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Thus,
    to make sense of the various provisions of regulation 283 and to make them work
    coherently and consistently, the Fund must be treated as an “insurer” for the
    purpose of resolving disputes over the payment of accident benefits.</span></p>

    return to our court’s decision in <i>Kalinkine</i>.  As I have said, the facts were unusual.  Indeed, there was no real “dispute” because the insurer,
    Personal, conceded its liability to pay benefits and the amounts of those
    benefits.  It challenged only the forum
    in which the Fund sought reimbursement.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

    reasons, however, this court did say that the Fund was not an insurer under
    regulation 283.  I consider that
    statement to be incorrect.  The Fund is
    an insurer under regulation 283 and, where it disputes its obligation to pay
    benefits, it must resolve that dispute, not in the court, but in accordance
    with the arbitration process under the regulation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In <i>Kalinkine</i>,
    this court said that regulation 283 did not preclude the Fund from seeking
    restitution in the courts “in a proper case.”  I agree.  <i>Kalinkine</i> itself
    was a proper case because there was nothing to arbitrate.  Whether there are other “proper cases” need
    not be decided on these appeals.</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Allstate
    submits that if the Fund is an insurer under regulation 283, then, like any
    other insurer it must comply with the time limits set out in the

    submission.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Allstate
    also contends, however, that the Fund initiated arbitration beyond the one-year
    period prescribed in section 7(2) of the regulation, and thus the arbitrator
    had no jurisdiction to consider its claim for reimbursement.  This contention has some merit but before
    the arbitrator Allstate withdrew this argument.  It cannot revive this argument on appeal.  I would not give effect to it.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>(iv)            The Issue of Dependency</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    arbitrator found that Allstate was liable for accident benefits because the
    victim of the accident was financially dependent on her mother and therefore an
    insured person under her mother’s policy with Allstate.  Allstate appealed the arbitrator’s finding
    of dependency.  The appeal court judge
    did not deal with the issue because he set aside the award for lack of
    jurisdiction.  In this court, Allstate
    did not renew its attack on the arbitrator’s finding of dependency.  Thus I have no basis even to consider
    setting aside that finding.</span></p>
