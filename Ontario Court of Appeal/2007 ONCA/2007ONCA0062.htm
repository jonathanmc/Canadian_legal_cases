  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the order of
    Justice Michael R. Dambrot of the Superior Court of Justice, dated January 27,
    2005, reported at [2005] O.J. No. 266 (Q.L.).</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>LASKIN J.A.:</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>A.            Overview</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal was argued together with the appeal in <i>Allstate
    Insurance Company of Canada v. Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund and Manitoba
    Public Insurance</i>.  Both appeals
    raised the same question of interpretation: is the Motor Vehicle Accident
    Claims Fund an insurer under O. Reg. 283/95, the regulation that provides for
    the mandatory arbitration of disputes between insurers over the payment of
    accident benefits to persons injured in car accidents?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal arises out of a dispute between the Fund and
    Kingsway General Insurance Company over the payment of accident benefits.  Two days before the accident, Kingsway had
    cancelled its policy of insurance because of insufficient funds in the
    insured’s bank account to pay the monthly premium.  When Kingsway later refused to pay accident benefits to the
    injured person, the Fund paid them and sought reimbursement at an arbitration.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The arbitrator, Mr. Robinson, conducted the arbitration under
    regulation 283.  He concluded that at
    the time of the accident, a “significant nexus” existed between the insured and
    Kingsway.  Because of this nexus, under
    section 2 of the regulation, Kingsway was required to pay accident benefits and
    then dispute its obligation to do so.  The arbitrator ordered that Kingsway pay the injured person’s accident
    benefits permanently because of its breach of section 2.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, Dambrot J. held that the arbitration was not
    conducted under regulation 283 because the Fund was not an insurer.  He held, however, that it was an arbitration
    by agreement under the <i>Arbitration Act</i>, <i>1991</i>, S.O. 1991,
    c.17.  Although he accepted that
    Kingsway ought to have paid accident benefits pending the arbitration, he held
    that the arbitration agreement did not authorize ordering Kingsway to pay
    benefits permanently for a breach of section 2 of the regulation.  He remitted the dispute to the arbitrator to
    determine whether Kingsway was an insurer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this court, the Fund asks that the order of the appeal
    court judge be set aside and that the award of the arbitrator be restored.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a>  In support of its position, the Fund makes
    three submissions.  First, the Fund
    submits that the appeal court judge erred in concluding that the arbitration
    was not conducted under regulation 283.  Second, it submits that the appeal court judge erred in holding that the
    arbitrator had not found Kingsway to be an insurer at the time of the
    accident.  Third, in the alternative,
    the Fund submits that even if Kingsway was not an insurer, the arbitrator
    correctly ordered Kingsway to pay accident benefits for its breach of section 2
    of regulation 283.  Thus, the appeal
    court judge erred in remitting to the arbitrator the question whether Kingsway
    was an insurer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the Fund’s first submission, for the reasons in <i>Allstate
    v. Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund</i>, I would hold that the Fund is an
    insurer under regulation 283.  Therefore, this arbitration was conducted under that regulation.  On the Fund’s second submission, in my view,
    the appeal court judge was correct in holding that the arbitrator did not
    decide that Kingsway was an insurer.  On
    the Fund’s third submission, in my opinion, the appeal court judge was correct
    in remitting to the arbitrator the question whether Kingsway was an
    insurer.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>B.        Facts Giving Rise to the Dispute</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    April 1, 2000, while walking along the street, Irene Legarde was injured when
    she was hit by a car owned and driven by her cousin Frances Legarde.  Kingsway had been Frances Legarde’s insurer.  Kingsway would therefore have been liable to
    pay Irene Legarde’s accident benefits except that on March 30, 2000 – two days
    before the accident – Kingsway had cancelled Frances Legard’s insurance.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Why
    had it done so?  Because the monthly
    premium payment of $123.58 deducted from Frances Legarde’s bank account had
    been returned NSF.  At the time, Frances
    Legarde had a balance in her account of $116.20, leaving a shortfall of $7.38.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    August 2000, Irene Legarde applied to Kingsway for accident benefits.  Kingsway refused to pay, claiming that
    Frances Legarde was not insured on the date of the accident.  Irene Legarde eventually applied to the
    Fund, which paid the benefits and began arbitration proceedings to recover the
    amount it had paid from Kingsway.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>C.            Analysis</span></h4>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>1.
    Did the appeal court judge err in concluding that the arbitration was not
    conducted under O. Reg. 283/95?</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    arbitrator noted the special status of the Fund.  Relying on the decision of Kennedy J. in <i>Ontario (Minister of
    Finance) v. ING Halifax</i> (2003), 15 C.C.L.I. (4<sup>th</sup>) 281 (Ont. Sup.
    Ct.), he held that although the Fund was not an insurer, its special status
    allowed it to use the dispute resolution process under regulation 283.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The appeal
    court judge pointed out that regulation 283 applied only to disputes between
    insurers.  He then applied this court’s
    decision in </span><i>Kalinkine v. Ontario (Superintendent of Financial
    Services)</i>, [2004] O.J. No. 5138 and held that because the Fund was not an
    insurer the arbitration was not conducted under the regulation.  He held, however, that the parties had
    entered into an arbitration agreement, which was governed by the provisions of
    the <i>Arbitration Act</i>, <i>1991</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons in the companion appeal, <i>Allstate v. The
    Fund</i>, I would hold that the Fund is an insurer under regulation 283.  Therefore, the Fund properly instituted
    arbitration proceedings under section 7 of regulation 283.  </p>
  <h3>&nbsp; </h3>
  <h3>&nbsp; </h3>
  <h3>2. Did the appeal court judge err in holding
    that the arbitrator had not found Kingsway to be an insurer at the time of the
    accident?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Fund argues that the arbitrator found Kingsway to have
    been Frances Legarde’s insurer at the time of the accident.  The appeal court judge did not read the
    arbitrator’s award that way and I do not either.  Nowhere in his reasons does the arbitrator expressly find that
    Kingsway was an insurer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, as I said earlier, the arbitrator did find a
    “significant nexus” between Frances Legarde and Kingsway.  He based that finding on two
    considerations.  First, Kingsway had
    included retail sales tax on the premium that it charged Frances Legarde; she,
    however, was a Status Indian living on a band reserve and therefore was exempt
    from retail sales tax.  Second, Kingsway
    had rated Frances Legarde as a Class 02 risk, a rating reserved for those who
    drive to work; she, however, was on welfare and should have been rated as a
    Class 01 risk, which would have attracted a lower premium.  If Frances Legarde had not been charged
    retail sales tax and had been properly rated, her monthly premium would have
    been $111.87, and the amount in her account ($116.20) would have been
    sufficient to pay it.  Thus, Kingsway
    would have had no reason to cancel her policy.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the arbitrator’s finding of a nexus between
    Frances Legarde and Kingsway.  The two
    considerations underlying his finding are supported by the record.  What flows from this nexus leads to the
    third issue on appeal.</p>
  <h3>&nbsp; </h3>
  <h3>3. Did the appeal court judge err in remitting
    to the arbitrator the question whether Kingsway was an insurer?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Irene Legarde first applied to Kingsway for accident
    benefits.  The arbitrator concluded that
    Kingsway should have paid her benefits because of the nexus between it and
    Frances Legarde at the time of the accident.  The arbitrator held that Kingsway’s failure to pay benefits was a breach
    of section 2 of regulation 283, which provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The first insurer that receives a completed
    application for benefits is responsible for paying benefits to an insured
    person pending the resolution of any dispute as to which insurer is required to
    pay benefits under section 268 of the Act.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>He penalized Kingsway for its breach
    by ordering it to pay Irene Legarde’s accident benefits permanently.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal court judge agreed that Kingsway had breached
    section 2.  But he held that the
    arbitrator had no jurisdiction to impose a penalty.  In his view, the arbitrator’s only task was to determine whether
    Kingsway or the Fund was responsible to pay benefits to Irene Legarde.  In order to find Kingsway responsible, it
    had to be an insurer at the time of the accident.  The arbitrator was required to decide that question.  The appeal court judge therefore set aside
    the award and remitted the question to the arbitrator.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this court, the Fund contends that the arbitrator correctly
    sanctioned Kingsway for its breach of section 2.  Kingsway contends that the arbitrator had no authority to order
    it to pay accident benefits for a breach of section 2, and that the appeal
    court judge was correct in setting aside the award.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 2 of regulation 283 is critically important in the
    timely delivery of benefits to victims of car accidents.  The principle that underlies section 2 is
    that the first insurer to receive an application for benefits must pay now and
    dispute later.  The rationale for this
    principle is obvious: persons injured in car accidents should receive
    statutorily mandated benefits promptly; they should not be prejudiced by being
    caught in the middle of a dispute between insurers over who should pay, or as
    in this case, by an insurer’s claim that no policy of insurance existed at the
    time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Insurers cannot avoid their obligation under section 2 by
    claiming that another insurer should pay or that an insurance policy was
    cancelled shortly before the accident.  If they could deny an application for accident benefits on either of
    these grounds, section 2 would be rendered meaningless.  Thus, arbitrators and the courts have
    developed a nexus test for triggering an insurer’s obligation under section 2.  As long as there is some nexus – some
    connection – between the insurer receiving an application for benefits and the
    insured, the insurer must pay pending the determination of its obligation to do
    so.  In addition to the arbitrator’s
    ruling in this case, see for example <i>Allstate Insurance Company of Canada v.
    Brown</i> (1998), 40 O.R. (3d) 610 (Div. Ct.); and <i>Ontario (Minister of
    Finance) v.</i> <i>Royal &amp; Sun Alliance</i> (January 2003, Arbitrator M.
    Guy Jones).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The nature of the nexus or connection required to trigger the
    insurer’s obligation under section 2 will vary from case to case.  Although I am inclined to agree with
    Arbitrator Jones in <i>Royal &amp; Sun Alliance</i>, <i>supra</i> – “[o]nly in
    the most extreme cases, where the connection with the insurers is totally
    arbitrary should the insurer refuse to pay” – to address the case before us I
    need not be precise about the extent of the connection required.  Here, the arbitrator found a significant
    connection, and there can be no doubt that this connection was sufficient to
    require Kingsway to pay Irene Legarde’s accident benefits.  Indeed, Kingsway’s hardball tactics in
    refusing to pay undermine the very purpose of section 2.  The appeal court judge put it this way:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[22] In my view it makes perfect sense to require
    Kingsway to pay the benefits in the first instance in circumstances such as
    these despite the fact that is says that it is not an insurer.  If an insurance company is permitted to
    refuse to pay benefits simply because it decides that it is not an insurer
    despite the existence of some connection between the company and the driver, it
    would undermine the purpose of the regulation – that accident victims not be
    denied statutory accident benefits simply because the first insurer applied to
    for benefits thinks another insurer should pay.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>I agree with these comments.  I add that Kingsway’s refusal to pay was
    particularly egregious because, by doing so, it transferred the initial
    financial burden to the publicly financed Fund.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What remedy should be imposed for Kingsway’s breach?  It is tempting to agree with the remedy the
    arbitrator imposed: require Kingsway to pay Irene Legarde’s accident benefits
    regardless of whether it was an insurer at the time of the accident.  The arbitrator no doubt considered – with
    justification – that insurers would not take their obligation under section 2
    seriously unless some penalty was imposed for its breach.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As tempting as it is to restore the arbitrator’s award, I
    think that the appeal court judge was correct in requiring the arbitrator to
    determine whether Kingsway was an insurer at the time of the accident.  The arbitrator might well have made that
    finding as he seemed to conclude that Kingsway’s own errors led it to cancel
    Frances Legarde’s insurance policy.  On
    reflection, the arbitrator may determine that Kingsway had no valid grounds to
    cancel the policy and therefore the policy was in effect at the time of the
    accident.  If so, it will be unnecessary
    to consider whether a sanction can and should be imposed for Kingsway’s breach
    of section 2.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the arbitrator finds Kingsway was not an insurer, then he
    can consider the question of the appropriate order in the light of that
    finding.  His consideration should then
    include not only the effect of Kingsway’s breach of section 2 of regulation
    283, but as well the effect of Kingsway’s failure to give timely notice of its
    intent to dispute its obligation to pay in accordance with section 3 of the
    regulation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would therefore uphold the appeal court judge’s order
    remitting to the arbitrator the question whether Kingsway was an insurer when
    the accident occured.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>D.            Conclusion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons in <i>Allstate v. Motor Vehicle Claims
    Accident Fund</i>, I would hold that the Fund is an insurer under regulation
    283.  Therefore, the arbitration
    initiated by the Fund between it and Kingsway was conducted under that
    regulation.  The appeal court judge,
    however, was correct in concluding that the arbitrator did not determine the
    question whether Kingsway was an insurer when the accident occurred and in
    remitting that question to the arbitrator.  </p>
