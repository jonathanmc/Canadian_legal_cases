  <p><b>On appeal from the order of Justice P.B. Hambly of

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>GOUDGE J.A.:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 7, 2005, the registrar dismissed the appellant’s
    action because he failed to respond within ninety days of service on him of the
    status notice served on him pursuant to rule 48.14(1). The notice required that
    within ninety days the action be set down for trial or an order obtained from a
    judge at a status hearing relieving against this. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On March 15, 2006, Hambly J. dismissed the appellant’s motion
    to set aside the  registrar’s order,
    brought pursuant to rule 48.14(11) and rule 37.14(1)(c). The motion judge
    required the appellant to satisfy each of four criteria in order to succeed.
    Since the appellant fell short on one, the motion failed, even though he met
    the other three. This is the appeal from that order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the motion judge
    erred in principle in taking this approach rather than considering all the
    relevant factors in order to determine the just order in the circumstances. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There were two affidavits before the motion judge, the first
    from the appellant’s solicitor at the time and the second from the appellant
    himself which, while filed late, was admitted over the respondent’s objection.
    These affidavits reveal the following facts, all of which are uncontested.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The statement of claim was filed in April 2002, claiming
    damages and specific performance in relation to certain real property in
    Waterloo, Ontario. Statements of defence were delivered by the end of September
    2002.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant agreed with his then solicitor that all legal
    fees would be paid to the solicitor after the trial of this matter. However,
    after doing the initial work, the solicitor sought payment and refused to work
    on the case further until that happened. This caused a breakdown in his
    relationship with the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In June 2003, the appellant contacted a second law firm, which
    required to see the file before proceeding. However, the appellant’s first
    solicitor would not release it until his account was paid. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Then in September 2004, the appellant retained the second law
    firm. It served a notice of change of solicitors on September 6, 2004. The
    appellant’s new solicitors finally received parts of the appellant’s file from
    the first solicitor in December 2004.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant stated that at all material times it was, and
    still is, his intention to proceed with the lawsuit and that he is eager to get
    results and go to trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The new law firm received the status notice from the registrar
    on October 7, 2004. It stated in part:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>MORE THAN TWO YEARS HAVE PASSED since a statement
    of defence in this action was filed. According to the records in the court
    office, this action has not been placed on the trial list or terminated.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THIS ACTION WILL BE DISMISSED FOR DELAY unless
    within ninety days after the service of this notice: (a) it is set down for
    trial; (b) it is terminated; or (c) a judge presiding at a status hearing
    orders otherwise.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A party may request the registrar to arrange a
    status hearing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The junior lawyer with the appellant’s new firm who was to
    deal with the status notice expected that she would be advised of a date for a
    status hearing, so did nothing. The registrar dismissed the action with costs
    on January 7, 2005. When the firm received a copy of this order on January 12,
    Mr. Sweeny’s office was retained and on February 1, 2005, he brought the motion
    to set aside the registrar’s order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On March 15, 2006, the motion judge dismissed the motion. He
    set out his view of the applicable test at para. 13 as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In <i>Reid  v. Dow Corning Corp</i>. (2001), 11 C.P.C.
    (5<sup>th</sup> ) 80 (affirmed as to the four-pronged test (2002) 48 C.P.C. (5<sup>th</sup>)
    93 (Ont. Div. Ct.)), Master Dash stated that the plaintiff must satisfy four
    criteria to obtain an order setting aside a registrar’s order dismissing an
    action pursuant to [r]ule 48.14(13). The four criteria are as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>explanation of the litigation delay;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>inadvertence in missing the deadline;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the motion is brought promptly; and,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>no prejudice to the defendant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge determined that the appellant satisfied the
    last three criteria. That conclusion is not contested in this court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the motion judge found that the appellant did not
    provide a satisfactory explanation for the delay in pursuing the action from
    the filing of defences in September 2002 to the registrar’s order in January
    2005. He held that the explanation was deficient because it did not provide
    particulars about such things as when the appellant reached the agreement with
    his first solicitor that payment await the end of the trial; what that
    solicitor’s assessment of the merits of the case was; what the charge would be
    and whether it would depend on the result; how much the solicitor subsequently
    required to be paid and whether the appellant could have paid it; and why the
    action was not pursued after the filing of the notice of change of solicitors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because of the appellant’s insufficient explanation for the
    delay, the motion judge dismissed the motion because the appellant failed to
    satisfy one of the four requirements set out in <i>Reid, supra</i>.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule 48.14 regulates the status notice and the status hearing
    in a civil action. Subsection (1) provides for the status notice. Subsection
    (3) requires that the registrar dismiss the action for delay with costs, where,
    as here, nothing happens in response to the notice. Its companion piece,
    subsection (4), requires the registrar to do the same where the action is not
    set down within the time specified in an order made at a status hearing.
    Subsection (11) provides that these orders may be set aside under rule 37.14.
    These subsections of Rule 48 read as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   <b>48.14</b>(1)  Where an action in which a statement of
    defence has been filed has not been placed on a trial list or terminated by any
    means within two years after the filing of a statement of defence, the
    registrar shall serve on the parties a status notice (Form 48C) that the action
    will be dismissed for delay unless it is set down for trial or terminated
    within ninety days after service of the notice.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> (3) The registrar shall dismiss the action for
  delay, with costs, ninety days after service of the status notice, unless,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> (a) the action has been set down for trial;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a.1) in an action under Rule 78, documents have been
    filed in accordance with rule 78.08;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> (b) the action has been terminated by any means; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c) a judge presiding at a status hearing has
    ordered otherwise. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> (4) Where
    an action is not set down for trial or terminated by any means within the time specified
    in an order made at a status hearing, the registrar shall dismiss the action
  for delay, with costs.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center;'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> (11) An
  order under this rule dismissing an action may be set aside under rule 37.14.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The provisions of rule 37.14 relevant to this appeal are subsections
    (1)(c) and (2). They read:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> 37.14(1) A
  party or other person who,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center;'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>is affected by an order of a registrar,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>may move to set aside or vary the order, by a
    notice of motion that is served forthwith after the order comes to the person’s
    attention and names the first available hearing date that is at least three
    days after service of the notice of motion.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> (2) On a motion under subrule (1), the court may
  set aside or vary the order on such terms as are just.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue is what these rules require the appellant to show to
    have the registrar’s order of January 7, 2005, set aside. In particular, did
    the motion judge err by requiring the appellant to meet each of four criteria
    in order to succeed?  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In coming to his view the motion judge relied on the decision
    of Master Dash in <i>Reid</i>, supra, which
    sets out the four criteria and the appellant’s obligation to meet each one
    separately. It was put this way in that decision at para. 40:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>While I agree there must be some balancing of
    interests, I find, upon review of the caselaw presented to me, that in
    determining whether to set aside a registrar’s order dismissing an action made
    under rule 48.14(3), a plaintiff must satisfy four criteria. If the plaintiff
    fails to satisfy any one of these criteria, the registrar’s order  will stand.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge went on to find that this approach had been
    upheld by the Divisional Court in that case. With respect, I do not agree.
    Writing for the Divisional Court, Then J. simply recited the criteria used by
    the master in his description of the decision appealed from. He did so without
    approval, before going on to allow the appeal on other grounds, without
    commenting on the criteria or the proposed requirement that each one must be
    met.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More importantly, I do not agree that the case law reviewed in <i>Reid</i>, <i>supra</i>, yields the proposition that an appellant must satisfy each
    relevant criterion in order to have the registrar’s order set aside. None of
    the cases referred to say so expressly and several proceed on a more contextual
    basis. For example, in <i>Steele v.
    Ottawa-Carleton (Regional Municipality)</i>, [1998] O.J. No. 3154 (Gen. Div.)
    Master Beaudoin, at para. 17, described the guiding principle in deciding
    whether to set aside a Rule 48.14 dismissal by the registrar as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>… Ultimately, the Court will exercise its
    discretion upon a consideration of the relevant factors and will attempt to
    balance the interests of the parties. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with Master Beaudoin. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, a contextual approach to this question is to be
    preferred to a rigid test requiring an appellant to satisfy each one of a fixed
    set of criteria. The latter approach is not mandated by the jurisprudence. On
    the other hand, the applicable rules clearly point to the former. In
    particular, the motion to set aside the registrar’s order dismissing the action
    for delay engages rule 37.14(1)(c) and (2). The latter invites the court to
    make the order that is just in the circumstances. A fixed formula like that
    applied by the motion judge is simply too inflexible to allow the court in each
    case to reach the just result contemplated by the rules. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That is not to say that there are no criteria to guide the
    court. Indeed I view the criteria used by the motion judge as likely to be of
    central importance in most cases. While there may be other relevant factors in
    any particular case, these will be the main ones. The key point is that the
    court consider and weigh all relevant factors to determine the order that is
    just in the circumstances of the particular case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It may be that in a particular case, one factor on which the
    appellant comes up short is of such importance that, taken together with the
    other factors, the appellant must fail. What is important is that the analysis
    be contextual to permit the court to make the order that is just.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, in my view, the motion judge erred in principle by
    requiring the appellant to satisfy each of the four criteria separately in
    order to succeed in setting aside the registrar’s order, without considering
    and weighing all the relevant factors. I would therefore set aside his order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude that a contextual approach leads to the opposite
    result. There is no doubt that the appellant missed the 90-day deadline set out
    in rule 48.14(1) because of the inadvertence of his lawyer. The motion to set
    aside the registrar’s order was brought promptly. And the respondent can point
    to no prejudice. Importantly, no limitation period has passed. Finally, while
    it would have been preferable if the appellant had provided more details, he
    did provide an explanation of the litigation delay. Moreover, his assertion
    that he always intended to proceed with the lawsuit and is eager to go to trial
    is unchallenged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, I do not think that the shortage of detail in
    the appellant’s explanation of delay is determinative, given the inadvertence
    of the appellant’s solicitor, the prompt motion to set aside the order, and,
    particularly, the complete absence of prejudice. Taking these factors together,
    I conclude that the just order is to set aside the registrar’s order on terms
    that the appellant either set the action down for trial or arrange a status
    hearing within 60 days of this decision. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the order
    appealed from and the order of the registrar dated January 7, 2005 and substitute
    the order described above.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because the appellant is seeking an indulgence I would order
    no costs here or for the motion before Hambly J.</p>
