      with reasons reported at [2004] O.J. No. 1383; the second, dated April

      respondent attacked a man in a bar with a pool cue, hitting him three times
      on the head, knocking him unconscious and causing bleeding as well as some
      aftereffects. As a result, the respondent was convicted of aggravated assault
      contrary to s. 268 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, an indictable offence for
      which the maximum sentence is fourteen years.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

'>[1]</span></span></span></a> The respondent had a lengthy criminal record that
      included adult convictions for ten prior crimes of violence against both
      strangers and two former spouses, including two sexual assaults against
      strangers. Before sentencing on the predicate offence of aggravated assault,
      the Crown obtained an order for an assessment for the purpose of a dangerous
      offender application.</span></p>

      the hearing of evidence and submissions at the dangerous offender hearing,
      the sentencing judge (who was not the trial judge) decided, as a matter
      of law, that before a person can be declared a dangerous offender, the
      court must determine that it would otherwise impose a minimum two year
      sentence for the predicate offence. The sentencing judge concluded that
      this was necessary in order to make the dangerous offender provision, s.
      753, consistent with the similar requirement that is specifically imposed
      by s. 753.1(1)(a) before a person can be declared a long-term offender. </span></p>

      the respondent had been in pre-sentence custody for over three years, the
      sentencing judge determined that the appropriate sentence for the predicate
      offence was two years less a day, plus three years probation. As a result,
      he found that the respondent did not meet one of the criteria for designation
      as a dangerous or long-term offender and concluded that there was therefore
      no basis for continuing the dangerous or long-term offender proceedings,
      or for making any further findings on the statutory criteria for those
      designations. He imposed the determinate sentence of two years less a day
      (which the respondent had already served), plus three years probation on
      stringent conditions that included treatment and testing requirements.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>With
      respect, in my view, the sentencing judge erred in law by reading into
      the dangerous offender provision, s. 753 of the <i>Code</i>, as a prerequisite,
      the requirement that the sentencing judge must first find that a minimum
      sentence of two years would have been imposed for the predicate offence.  He
      then failed to fully consider whether the respondent met all of the statutory
      criteria for a dangerous or long-term offender designation, to address
      the issues mandated by the statutory provisions, and to make the required
      findings and exercise his discretion whether or not to declare the respondent
      a dangerous or long-term offender.  Finally, the sentencing judge erred
      in his conclusion that the appropriate sentence in this case was 2 years
      less a day.  Therefore, for the reasons that follow, I would allow the
      appeal, and set aside the sentence imposed. In the circumstances of this
      appeal, I would designate the respondent a long-term offender.</span></p>

      August 9, 2001, the respondent was convicted by Keenan J., sitting without
      a jury, of aggravated assault and possession of a weapon for a dangerous
      purpose. The trial judge found that following an argument in a pub over
      the use of a pool table, the respondent took a pool cue and hit the victim
      over the head with it three times, knocking him unconscious. The victim
      was taken to the hospital bleeding from the head and requiring stitches.
      The victim later suffered headaches, periods of dizziness and mildly slurred

      application, it proceeded before Wren J.</span></p>

    reports and synopses relating to the respondent’s previous convictions, the
    Crown submitted that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent
    would be found to be a dangerous offender. Counsel for the respondent conceded
    that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent might be
    declared a long-term (not dangerous) offender, and accordingly did not oppose
    the Crown’s application. </span></p>

      and ordered that the respondent be remanded for a psychiatric assessment
      for a period not exceeding sixty days. He concluded, based on the material
      placed before him, that the Crown had satisfied its burden that there were
      reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent might be found to be
      a dangerous offender under ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and&nbsp;(ii). </span></p>

      under ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii), the offender must constitute a “threat

      respondent was assessed by three experts: two psychiatrists and a neuropsychologist.
      The first court-ordered assessment was conducted by Dr. Woodside, a staff
      psychiatrist and senior clinician at the Centre for Addiction and Mental
      Health (CAMH). Part-way through the assessment, the respondent refused
      to co-operate with Dr. Woodside; however, Dr. Woodside provided a report
      based on tests he had conducted and written records relating to the respondent’s
      history. The written records available to Dr. Woodside included psychiatric
      reports dated as early as 1982, misconduct reports completed during the
      respondent’s previous terms of incarceration, and evidence documenting
      the respondent’s record for co-operation (or lack thereof) with supervision
      in the community while on probation and parole. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Dr.
      Woodside concluded that the respondent suffered from antisocial personality
      disorder. He described the respondent as displaying some psychopathic traits,
      although he fell below the required score for a clinical diagnosis of psychopathy.
      Dr. Woodside also reported that the respondent had severe drug and alcohol
      addictions.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Dr.
      Woodside’s opinion was that the respondent posed a very significant risk
      to commit future violent offences, both sexual and non-sexual, and that
      there was no reasonable prospect that he could be controlled in the community.
      Because the respondent suffered from antisocial personality disorder, Dr.
      Woodside’s view was that it was unlikely he would benefit from therapy.
      His view on that issue did not change after reading Dr. Fedoroff’s opinion
      that the respondent may also suffer from a psychiatric condition known
      as “personality change due to a generalized medical condition”, a disorder
      that may have been caused by brain surgery or by substance abuse, and might
      therefore be treatable. Dr. Woodside continued to doubt the effectiveness
      of any proposed treatments in the respondent’s case.</span></p>

      Fedoroff conducted a second court-ordered assessment, at the request of
      the defence, with which the respondent co-operated. Dr. Fedoroff is the
      co-director of the Sexual Behaviours Clinic at the

    Hospital. Although he substantially agreed with Dr. Woodside’s diagnosis
    and actuarial testing results, he disagreed on the prognosis for the respondent.
    He believed that it was necessary to try treatment on the respondent before
    concluding that he was not treatable or could not be controlled in the community.
    He also viewed the predicate offence as less serious than the respondent’s
    previous offences of violence. He therefore felt that this particular offence
    either was not part of a pattern of violent behaviour or was part of a pattern
    of decreasing violence. He also expressed the view that the predicate offence
    was not serious enough to attract a minimum sentence of two years.</span></p>

      judge must determine that the predicate offence is a “serious personal
      injury offence” as defined, and that the minimum sentence the offender
      would receive for the predicate offence is two years; (2) at the second
      stage of the process, in order to have an offender designated a dangerous
      offender pursuant to s. 753(1)(a), the Crown must establish both that the
      predicate offence is a
    “serious personal injury offence” as defined,  and that a sentence of at
    least two years is the appropriate sentence for that offence, and; (3) the

      the predicate offence of aggravated assault is a “serious personal injury

    from witnesses such as former parole and probation officers for the purpose
    of the dangerous offender application, he decided that it was appropriate
    to use that evidence for the purpose of determining whether a sentence of
    at least two years should be imposed for the predicate offence. He made it
    clear that he was using the evidence only in the context of applying the
    sentencing principles and objectives found in ss. 718 and 718.1 of the <i>Code </i>for

      under s.&nbsp;753(4) once the designation is made. This conclusion accords
      with the principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2 of the <i>Code</i>,

      provisions that the role of the predicate offence was fully thought out
      by Parliament and incorporated into the design of the provisions. For a
      dangerous offender, the predicate offence must be a “serious personal injury
      offence” and must form part of a pattern of violent conduct that suggests
      that the offender is a danger to the public. The nature and gravity of
      the predicate offence form an integral part of the critical analysis that
      the court must follow before it can find an offender to be dangerous. Had

      of two years or more followed by a period of supervision in the community

      the purpose of protecting the public” (para. 20).  Therefore, if the sentencing

      (3d) 62, released on April 15, 2004. As in this case, the trial judge had
      ruled that the offender could not be declared a dangerous or long-term

      serious enough to trigger those provisions. He concluded that the predicate

      115 C.C.C. (3d) 205, that the predicate offence need only qualify as a “serious
      personal injury offence”, as defined, in order to trigger the dangerous
      offender provision. The court then applied the tests set out in the section
      in order to determine whether the offender’s past conduct, including the
      predicate offence, revealed that he presented a potential future danger
      to the public. This court quoted from Lamer J.'s reasons in <i>Currie</i>:</span></p>

      also stated that because there was no victim impact statement, the extent

      731(1)(b) of the <i>Code</i> allows the court to make a probation order
      in addition to a sentence of not more than two years imprisonment. S 732.2(2)(b)
      limits the length of a probation order to not more than three years. Normally,
      a sentencing judge who wants to impose a period of probation will impose
      a sentence of less than two years so that when the offender is released
      on probation, he or she will be under the auspices of the provincial probation
      authorities. Although the section allows a term of probation to be imposed
      in addition to a two-year sentence, that sentence puts the offender into
      the federal penitentiary system. </span></p>
