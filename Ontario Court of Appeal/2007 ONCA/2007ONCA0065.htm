style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from a disposition of the Ontario Review
    Board made on October 31, 2005 ordering that he be detained at the minimum
    secure unit of the North Bay Psychiatric Hospital (the “Hospital”). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that the detention order is
    unreasonable and that he should have been discharged absolutely. In addition,
    he says that, because his October 13, 2005 hearing was held more than one year
    following the date of his last hearing (September 13, 2004) and more than one
    year following the date of his last disposition (October 8, 2004), the Board
    lacked jurisdiction to hold a hearing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Amicus curiae</i> appointed
    to assist the court submits that the Board erred in failing to inquire into and
    make any determination concerning why the hospital had not exercised the
    discretion granted to it to allow the appellant to exercise various off-ward
    privileges. Further, <i>amicus curiae</i> contends that this failure resulted in a disposition that was not the “least
    onerous and least restrictive” as required by s. 672.54 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On August 9, 2004, the appellant was found not criminally
    responsible on account of mental disorder on two counts of failing to appear in
    court<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a> and on one count of resisting arrest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>            b)
    The October 8, 2004 disposition   </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following a disposition hearing on October 8, 2004, the Board
    ordered that the appellant be detained at the medium secure unit of the North
    Bay Psychiatric Hospital, subject to various conditions. The conditions
    included a term requiring the person in charge of the Hospital to create a
    program for the detention and rehabilitation of the appellant and affording the
    person in charge the discretion to grant the appellant off-ward privileges.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The available off-ward privileges included the following:
    hospital and grounds privileges (indirectly supervised); the ability to enter
    the community of North Bay accompanied by staff person or other approved
    person; passes for up to 16 hours to attend hospital approved programs within
    Ontario accompanied by staff; passes for up to one day, up to four times per
    year, to visit family accompanied by staff or other approved person; and the
    ability to attend for neurological assessment or treatment of his head injury
    for up to ninety days.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>            c)
    The appellant’s prior history </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was born on September 27, 1975. In June 1993, at
    the age of seventeen, he was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered
    a severe closed head injury that resulted in brain damage. Alcohol consumption
    by the appellant was a contributing factor in the accident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1998, the appellant was assessed by the Acquired Brain
    Injury Program in Sudbury. The results indicated decreased decision-making and
    problem-solving skills; poor impulse control; poor sequential reasoning; and
    poor social skills. It also appeared that part of his coping mechanism involved
    alcohol abuse.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant underwent a further assessment in 2000 by Dr.
    Persinger. The tests confirmed that the appellant is of average intelligence.
    However, a personality inventory showed “elevations on the scales which infer
    depression, suspiciousness, apprehension, and eccentric thinking.” Overall, the
    appellant’s results were consistent with “permanent dysfunctions within the
    pre-frontal and parietal regions of the brain.”  Based on the assessment, Dr. Persinger recommended that the
    appellant never consume alcohol or other psychotropic drugs, as doing so would
    likely increase the likelihood of inappropriate behaviours and unusual
    thoughts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the four-year period between March 2000 and June 2004, the
    appellant accumulated over thirty criminal convictions. The offences of which
    he was convicted consist primarily of assault (x6), uttering threats (x2),
    resisting arrest (x3) and breaches of court orders (x20). However, for the most
    part, any custodial sentences he received were of relatively short duration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>            d)
    The appellant’s current diagnosis </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s current diagnosis is “Psychotic Disorder Not
    Otherwise Specified.” According to Dr. Mantle, the appellant’s treating
    psychiatrist, the appellant believes he has been persecuted by the legal system
    and he is tormented by these beliefs. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Amongst other beliefs, the appellant feels that he has been
    victimized by the courts, the government, the Ontario Review Board and
    currently, by several members of the Hospital staff, including Dr. Mantle. The
    appellant apparently believes that a judge was bribed in relation to his case
    and that he (the appellant) will receive a substantial financial settlement
    once the truth about his unlawful detention is discovered. In one interview, he
    informed Dr. Mantle that his level of distress was ten out of ten.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Mantle expressed the opinion at the 2005 Board hearing
    that “there has not been much change” in the appellant’s “mental state” since
    the 2004 hearing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>            <b>e)
    The Hospital</b> <b>Report</b> <b>prepared for the 2005 Board hearing</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to the Hospital Report prepared for the 2005 Board
    hearing, the appellant’s behaviour since his detention has not presented any
    management problems. The following comments were made in anticipation of the
    2004 and 2005 Review Board hearings respectively:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Since
    [the appellant’s] admission to hospital in early July, his behaviour has been
    exemplary. He is a very pleasant and cooperative individual. He presents no
    management problems and is compliant in following the ward program. He
    socializes well with co-patients and actively participates in the recreational
    activities offered…. There have been absolutely no incidents or physical
    aggression or violence, nor have there been any altercations in his dealings
    with others.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=center style='
text-align:center;
line-height:normal;'>…</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>In
    terms of his behaviour on the ward, [the appellant] has presented no management
    problems. He is co-operative and compliant with the ward program…. He is
    pleasant and appropriate in his dealings with most staff unless his beliefs are
    challenged. He interacts well with the co-patients and has a regular routine of
    playing cards in the dayroom in the evening with others. He makes use of the
    activity room on a regular basis, and he also helps out with other co-patients
    when he can.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the Hospital Report also includes the following
    information:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>in October 2004, the psychiatrist completing the
    appellant’s forensic assessment received a telephone call from the Crown
    Attorney in Gore Bay indicating that the appellant had been making telephone
    calls to the courthouse and that the workers there were frightened and
    intimidated by his calls;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>although Dr. Mantle and other Hospital staff attempted
    to educate the appellant about his illness and treatment options, their efforts
    were to no avail and caused the appellant to become increasingly hostile to Dr.
    Mantle, who he referred to as “that tramp”, “idiot”, “clown” and “mental
    Mantle”. He also referred to other members of the treatment team as “clowns”
    and to nursing staff as “guards” and “Dr. Mantle’s groupies”;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>in December 2004, Dr. Mantle found the appellant
    incapable of making treatment decisions. That finding was subsequently upheld
    by the Consent and Capacity Review Board;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>in December 2004, the appellant’s parents provided a
    substitute consent for treatment with anti-psychotic medication. However,
    treatment was delayed for a number of reasons<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a> and did not commence until July 2005;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>in February 2005, on the day before the appellant was
    to attend an MRI appointment in Sudbury, an individual from the Crown
    Attorney’s office in Toronto advised the Hospital that he had received a call
    from the appellant in which the appellant expressed an intention to elope while
    on the MRI appointment and the view that he would be justified in harming
    others if necessary;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>after a police escort was arranged, the appellant
    refused to attend the MRI appointment. He subsequently refused to attend
    various other referrals for further investigation of his brain injury (e.g. the
    Movement Disorders program in Toronto, neuropsychological testing, the Acquired
    Brain Injury Program in Hamilton)<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[3]</span></a>;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>following commencement of treatment with the
    anti-psychotic medication, the appellant continued to express the same
    delusional beliefs as he did at the time of his admission. However, as of the
    date of the Hospital Report, the stress regarding his delusions of persecution
    “appeared to have lessened somewhat”; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>over the course of the preceding year, the appellant
    was “not well enough to be granted any of the provisions contained in his
    current custodial order.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Hospital report concluded with the opinion that the
    appellant is a significant threat to the safety of the public essentially for
    the following reasons:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>he suffers from a serious mental disorder;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>he remains actively psychotic;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>he has a history of alcohol and cannabis abuse and of
    becoming increasingly aggressive while under the influence;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>he lacks insight into his mental disorder and into his
    substance abuse problems;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>he has a prior criminal record, which includes a
    history of violence and non-compliance with court orders; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>he remains un-accepting of attempts to assist him and
    would not likely remain compliant with medications if left to his own devices.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the Hospital treatment team agreed that the least
    onerous and least restrictive alternative was a custodial disposition, they
    were split as to the necessary level of security. Some members thought a medium
    security disposition was necessary while others felt a minimum security
    disposition would be appropriate:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Some
    of the team members were of the view that as [the appellant] has not displayed
    any incidents of violent or aggressive behaviour while detained on the medium
    secure unit and has been compliant in following the ward program, that he could
    be managed quite easily in a minimum secure unit. However, there were other
    members of the team that were of the view that as he has been detained on the
    medium secure unit over the course of the past year with no opportunity to have

    Dr. Mantle’s testimony at the October 13, 2005 Board hearing</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the October 13, 2005 Board hearing, Dr. Mantle confirmed
    her view that the appellant continues to pose a significant risk to the public.
    However, while she had some reservations about whether the appellant would like
    the minimum security setting because of the different mix of patients, she also
    expressed the opinion that based on his behaviour, he should have the
    opportunity of going to a less restrictive setting in the hospital.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Mantle described a belief held by the appellant that many
    of his problems stem from wrongdoing in relation to a court transcript, and
    that if Hospital staff could listen to the tape from the court hearing they
    would understand much of what he has been going through. She said his belief is
    so strong that he has made numerous contacts to the Gore Bay court, the Human
    Rights Commission and others in relation to his plight.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In response to a question from appellant’s counsel at the
    Board hearing, Dr. Mantle expressed the view that more could be done in terms
    of creating a less-restrictive environment for the appellant. In doing so, she
    noted that the appellant had been restricted to the unit and to a yard that is
    an extension of the unit. She commented on the Hospital’s failure to grant the
    appellant discretionary off-ward privileges as follows:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Unfortunately
    the envelope of privileges that are available to us have not been used in the
    last year, and this has been a source of considerable upset and concern for
    various members of the staff. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>I
    think the primary concern that has gotten in the way of [the appellant’s] use
    of these privileges are concerns about the potential for elopement. That being
    said, he said he was planning to elope; he hasn’t, to my knowledge, made any
    attempts to elope. We have patients on less secure units that actually do elope
    and remain on minimum secure units. He has opportunity to leave right now, and
    he’s sitting quietly and calmly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>And
    he has re-assured us quite—in no uncertain terms he has told us that he would
    not elope at this point. He believes he is entitled to a huge settlement once
    it is determined that he has been wrongfully detained here, and he can’t leave
    and have no address. There needs to be somewhere, in his—his mind, to—to send
    that money.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>So,
    unfortunately, no we haven’t gotten very far with the use of privileges, but I
    really feel that there is a way that we can do things to make things less
    restrictive for [the appellant].</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> At the Board hearing,
    counsel for the Hospital posited the likelihood that, without a custodial order,
    the appellant would leave the Hospital, discontinue his medication, and revert
    to a pattern of substance abuse and aggressive behaviour. However, because the
    Hospital team was split concerning the appropriate level of security, counsel
    left that issue to the Board. Counsel for the Crown supported the Hospital’s
    position.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to setting out the appellant’s request for an
    absolute discharge, appellant’s counsel noted that the appellant was already
    entitled to discretionary off-ward privileges. Counsel urged that the “Hospital
    be given the latitude” to place the appellant in minimum security “to get him
    moving, to get him realizing that the Hospital is trying to help him.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>II. The Board’s Decision</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board began its decision by noting the appellant’s current
    disposition ordering his detention in a medium secure unit of the Hospital
    “with privileges that include, ‘attending any facility for a period not to
    exceed 90 days for … assessment of his head injury”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After reviewing the appellant’s diagnosis, the circumstances
    of the index offences, the appellant’s criminal record and his prior
    psychiatric history, the Board turned to his course of treatment at the
    Hospital. In that respect, the Board noted that the appellant had blocked or
    refused various assessments and treatment efforts, but said that as the
    appellant had not engaged in any violence or aggressive behaviour, the
    treatment team was divided as to the level of security he requires.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board concluded that the appellant is a significant risk
    to the safety of the public. It noted that the diagnosis that he suffered from
    a serious mental disorder was “not really questioned” and said: “[h]is lengthy
    record of criminal conduct after the head injury, together with beliefs that
    those about him seek to hurt him and plot against him, convince us that this is
    so.” The Board went on to find that in the light of the appellant’s mental
    state and “his other needs,” the least onerous and least restrictive
    alternative would be “no change in the current Disposition except that his
    detention is to be in the minimum-secure unit of the hospital.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the Board expressed the hope that the appellant would
    take advantage of the special provision allowing a transfer for assessment
    purposes.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 672.81 of the <i>Criminal
    Code </i>requires that a Review Board “hold a hearing not later than twelve
    months after making a disposition and every twelve months thereafter for as
    long as the disposition remains in force, to review any disposition that it has
    made in respect of an accused, other than an absolute discharge…”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since the appellant’s 2005 Board hearing was held more than
    twelve months after his 2004 disposition, it is apparent that the mandatory
    requirements of s. 672.81 were not complied with in this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, I do not accept the appellant’s submission that the
    failure to comply with s. 672.81 deprived the Board of the jurisdiction to hold
    a hearing. No authorities were submitted in support of this position. In my
    view, while the failure to comply with s. 672.81 may have afforded the
    appellant certain remedies in terms of compelling a hearing to be held, it did
    not deprive the 2005 Board of jurisdiction to hold a hearing and make a further
    disposition. I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the Board’s decision to detain the appellant in a
    minimum secure setting was not unreasonable. As noted by the Board, the fact that
    the appellant suffers from a serious mental disorder is not really in dispute.
    Further, in my view, the Board’s conclusion that the appellant poses a
    significant threat to the safety of the public requiring a custodial
    disposition was justified based on the appellant’s criminal record and the
    evidence concerning his lack of insight into his mental disorder, his attitude
    to medication and treatment and his history of substance abuse and resulting
    aggressive behaviour.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As already noted, as the result of not being afforded various
    discretionary off-ward privileges during the one-year period following the
    October 2004 disposition, the appellant was confined completely to his Hospital
    unit and a yard that is an extension of the unit. The Board made no mention of
    this issue in its reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Amicus curiae</i> submits that the failure of the Board to inquire into and make a determination
    concerning the Hospital’s exercise of its discretion concerning the off-ward
    privileges is a breach of its duty to supervise its prior order. Further,
    because the discretionary off-ward privileges go to the core of the appellant’s
    liberty interest, if the Hospital’s actions were unreasonable, the Board erred
    by failing to impose the least onerous and least restrictive disposition when
    it failed to take any remedial steps. <i>Amicus
    curiae</i> therefore asks that the October 31, 2005 disposition be quashed and
    that a new hearing be ordered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, on the facts of this case, the future
    implementation of the appellant’s discretionary off-ward privileges was a
    matter going to his core liberty interests and the Board was therefore required
    to address the issue. However, while I agree that it would have been preferable
    for the Board to address this issue explicitly, in my view, the Board’s
    intention that such privileges be implemented is implicit in its decision to
    change the level of security at which the appellant was being detained. In these
    circumstances, any ongoing failure to implement the discretionary off-ward
    privileges is a matter that can be addressed at the next annual review hearing.
    I reach these conclusions for several reasons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, on the facts of this case, I agree that implementation
    of the discretionary off-ward privileges was a matter going to the core of the
    appellant’s liberty interests. In this regard, it is important to note the
    specific provisions of s. 672.54 of the<i> Criminal Code</i> setting out the dispositions that may be made concerning an
    NCR accused and in particular, the conditions that may be attached:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>672.54
    Where a court or Review Board makes a disposition … it shall, taking into
    consideration the need to protect the public from dangerous persons, the mental

    other needs of the accused, make one of the following dispositions that is <i>the least onerous and least restrictive</i> to the accused:</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Penetanguishene
    Mental Health Centre v. Ontario (Attorney General)</i> (2004), 182 C.C.C. (3d)
    193 (S.C.C.), the Supreme Court of Canada made it clear that any disposition
    that is made with respect to an NCR accused under s. 672.54 (b) and (c) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> includes the conditions
    that are attached to it. Moreover, the court also made it clear that the
    requirement in s. 672.54 that any disposition be “the least onerous and least
    restrictive to the accused” extends to the conditions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue in <i>Penetanguishene</i> was whether, as part of its mandate to determine the least onerous and least
    restrictive disposition, the Board had jurisdiction to direct that an NCR
    accused be transferred from a maximum security setting to a minimum security
    setting. In <i>Penetanguishene</i> evidence
    was adduced indicating that “the level of security of the institution in which
    an NCR accused is detained is not, standing alone, the best measure of the
    relative liberty available to the individual”. Moreover, the Crown stated in
    its factum:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>The
    commonly used security level classifications are not defined and there are many
    other conditions relating to the freedom of movement provided to the patient
    within the facility that will determine the relative liberty available to the
    NCR accused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At para. 32 of<i> Penetanguishene</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada said, “[a]part from hospital
    selection, there are other conditions routinely considered by Review Boards
    that also affect the liberty interest”. By way of example, the court referred
    to privileges affording access to hospital grounds and the community. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While it is undoubtedly not the intention of the legislation
    that the implementation of a condition affording discretionary off-ward
    privileges be micromanaged by the Board, where there is a complete failure to
    implement all, or important aspects of, such a condition, in my view, that is a
    matter that can call into question whether “the least onerous and least
    restrictive” disposition has been carried out. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, I note that in <i>Mazzei v. British Columbia (Director of Adult Forensic Psychiatric
    Services)</i>, [2006] S.C.J. No. 7 at para. 22, the Supreme Court of Canada
    made it clear that the Board has a supervisory role to play concerning the
    implementation of conditions:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>By
    specifying that Review Boards are mandated to “direct” what happens to an NCR
    accused, rather than “ordering” a conditional discharge or hospital detention,
    the wording of s. 672.54 suggest that Parliament intended that Review Boards
    should supervise the process of implementing a disposition order or condition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the issue in <i>Mazzei</i> was the scope of the Board’s authority to impose conditions relating to the
    provision of medical treatment that are binding on hospital authorities, it
    seems to me that Parliament’s intentions concerning the Board’s role in
    implementing a disposition order or condition is also significant where there
    has been a complete failure to implement important aspects of a condition
    providing for discretionary off-ward privileges. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the Hospital did not, for example, afford the
    appellant any hospital or grounds privileges in the one-year period subsequent
    to October 2004. As already noted, during that period, he was essentially
    confined to his Hospital unit and a yard that is an extension of the unit as a
    result. In these circumstances, in my view, the appellant’s core liberty
    interests were engaged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, in my view, the Hospital report made it clear that
    there were two reasons why the appellant’s discretionary off-ward privileges
    were not more fully implemented following the October 2004 disposition. The
    first reason was that the appellant was not considered well enough to exercise
    any of the privileges. The second reason was that at least some portion of the
    Hospital treatment team believed that the appellant should not be afforded any
    discretionary privileges because of “the incident in which he voiced his intent
    to elope while out on a medical appointment”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I read the Hospital report, the reference to the appellant
    not being well enough to exercise discretionary off-ward privileges relates to
    the fact that the appellant remained actively psychotic throughout the one-year
    period following the October 2004 disposition, was resistant to treatment and
    experienced limited improvement once treatment with anti-psychotic medication
    began. Further, based on the Hospital report and Dr. Mantle’s evidence, in my
    view, it is clear that, while the Hospital team was divided, some members of
    the team felt it necessary that the appellant remain in a medium security
    environment and not be afforded off-ward privileges because he had expressed an
    intention to elope on a specific occasion and the view that he would be
    justified in harming others in order to do so. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, although the Board’s reasons appear to focus on the
    appellant’s lack of violence or aggressive behaviour in the preceding year, it
    is implicit in the Board’s reasons that it rejected the view held by at least
    some members of the Hospital team that the appellant’s mental status and threat
    of elopement required a medium security setting. Viewed in this light, in my
    view, the Board’s decision to change the appellant’s detention status from
    medium to minimum security and, at the same time, to maintain all of the discretionary
    off-ward privileges included in the previous year’s disposition is a clear
    signal that the Board intended that the concerns cited by some members of the
    Hospital team should not operate as a bar to the future implementation of
    discretionary off-ward privileges. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Given this conclusion,
    I see no error in the Board’s disposition and I consider that any ongoing
    failure to implement the discretionary off-ward privileges is a matter that is
    properly raised at the next annual review hearing<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[5]</span></a>.</p>

    medication on the appellant’s cervical dystonia investigated further. This
    delay was prolonged by the appellant’s refusal to attend for testing. When the
    appellant’s parents consented to treatment without further investigations in
    May 2005, Dr. Mantle was on a leave absence until mid-July. Upon her return,
    Dr. Mantle obtained a second opinion concerning the effect of the
    anti-psychotic medication on the appellant’s dystonia and thereafter commenced
    treatment on July 22, 2005.</p>

    further assessment information may be used against him.</p>
