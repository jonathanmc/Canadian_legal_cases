    from the decision of Justice Bruce C. Hawkins of the Superior Court of Justice,
    sitting as a summary conviction appeal court judge, dated June 5, 2006,
    allowing the appeal of the appellant’s acquittal by Justice Ramez Khawly of the
    Ontario Court of Justice, dated March 8, 2005.</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BY THE COURT:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant appeals the decision of the summary conviction appeal judge allowing
    the Crown’s appeal and ordering a new trial from his acquittal by the trial
    judge on a charge of operating a motor vehicle with a concentration of alcohol
    in excess of 80 milligrams in his blood.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      At trial,
    counsel for the appellant brought a <i>Charter</i> application seeking to
    exclude the readings of the alcohol level on the basis that the appellant’s
    s.&nbsp;10(b) <i>Charter</i> rights had been violated because he had not been
    afforded the opportunity to call counsel on his cell phone while waiting for
    the Approved Screening Device (ASD) to arrive at the scene.&nbsp; Counsel also
    argued that the wording of the demand for a breath sample did not constitute a
    proper demand because it omitted the word “forthwith”.  As a result, this left the process of demand
    and response an open-ended one, lacking the element of immediacy required by
    the <i>Criminal Code</i> and <i>R. v. Woods</i> (2005), 197 C.C.C. (3d) 353
    (S.C.C.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The trial judge found that the wording
    used did not constitute a proper ASD demand and therefore, the demand was invalid.
    He also found that, in the circumstances, there was a reasonable opportunity
    for the appellant to call counsel on his cell phone.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a> Accordingly, he found that the appellant’s rights under s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter</i> had been breached. On the issue
    of s. 24(2), the trial judge gave brief reasons that are difficult to discern.
    They are reproduced in full below:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Given the
    decision that I have made on the forthwith issue which renders the demand
    invalid, to suggest, therefore, that under section 24(2), under the rubric that
    it is in the public interest in drinking and driving charges and to stop the
    tragic chaos on the streets to allow this type of evidence, in my view, would
    be rather stretching the public interest. Accordingly, that particular position
    taken by the Crown fails. That evidence will not be allowed into this trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown appealed the acquittal and the summary conviction
    appeal judge allowed the appeal, set aside the acquittal and ordered a new
    trial. &nbsp;The summary conviction appeal judge did not agree with the trial
    judge that the missing word rendered the demand invalid.&nbsp; He was of the
    view that there is no statutory requirement that the word “forthwith” must be
    used.&nbsp; He found that, as the demand had been made three minutes before the
    arrival of the machine, and the appellant knew that he was going to be required
    to submit to an ASD test when the machine arrived, the demand was made
    forthwith even though the word “forthwith” was not used. However, he agreed
    with the trial judge that the failure of the officer to afford the appellant an
    opportunity to use his cell phone to call counsel amounted to a s. 10(b)
    breach. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the s. 24(2) issue, contrary to the trial judge’s
    finding, the summary conviction appeal judge found that the exclusion of the breathalyser
    result would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. In so
    concluding, he simply referred to a passage in <i>R. v. Stillman</i> (1997), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 321 at 356 (S.C.C.) where
    Cory J., for the majority, referred to the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> provisions pertaining to breath samples as being “both minimally
    intrusive and essential to control the tragic chaos caused by drinking and
    driving”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the summary conviction appeal judge that the
    missing word “forthwith” did not render the demand invalid.&nbsp; The demand
    need not be in any particular form, provided it is made clear to the driver
    that he or she is required to give a sample of his or her breath forthwith.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>[2]</span></span></a>  This can be accomplished through words or
    conduct, including the “tenor [of the officer’s] discussion with the
    accused”.  See <i>R. &nbsp;v. Horvath</i>,
    [1992] B.C.J. No. 1107 (B.C.S.C.) (A.D.). What is crucial is that the words
    used be sufficient to convey to the detainee the nature of the demand. See <i>R. v. Ackerman</i> (1972), 6 C.C.C. (2d) 425
    at 427 (Sask. C.A.) and <i>R. v. Flegel</i> (1972), 7 C.C.C. (2d) 55 at 57 (Sask. C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the demand was made clear and the
    appellant understood. He knew that he was to provide a sample as soon as the
    machine arrived and he responded accordingly. Put differently, the appellant
    understood that the only event between the demand and his giving of the breath
    sample was the arrival of the ASD.  That
    being so, the only issue of substance is whether the police officer was in a
    position to require that the appellant provide a breath sample forthwith, i.e.
    before there was any realistic opportunity for him to consult counsel. See <i>R. v. Woods</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 362; <i>R. v. Cote</i> (1992), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 280 at 285 (Ont. C.A.) and <i>R. v. Latour</i> (1997), 116 C.C.C. (3d) 279 at 287 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On that issue, we believe that the courts below erred
    in failing to consider all the relevant circumstances when determining whether
    the roadside breath test had been&nbsp;administered forthwith and in equating
    the concept of a “realistic opportunity to consult with counsel” with the mere
    chance to place a call to a lawyer.<span style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. Latour</i>, <i>supra</i>, this court held that in deciding whether, in any particular
    case, there was a realistic opportunity to consult with counsel, all the
    circumstances must be considered, including the time which in fact elapsed
    between the demand and the taking of the breath sample. In so concluding, at p.
    287 Charron J.A. rejected the proposition that “unless the peace officer
    reasonably believes that he or she can ‘make the demand good’ at the time it is
    made, the demand is not valid even if the sample is, in actual fact, received
    into an approved screening device a few moments later.”  Rather, as she explained at p. 288:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>If, as the
    events actually unfold, the peace officer is in a position to require the
    person to provide the sample before there is any realistic opportunity to
    consult counsel, the statutory requirements are met. The detained person has no
    cause for complaint as the events will have unfolded in accordance with the
    legislative scheme and within its constitutional boundaries. I see no sound
    policy reason for requiring that the statutory requirements be met by design
    rather than by chance. Compliance is compliance whether fortuitous or
    otherwise.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice Charron’s remarks are apposite to this case. The breath demand was made at 2:32 a.m. and
    the ASD arrived approximately three minutes later, at 2:35 a.m.  According to the appellant, the testing
    began a few minutes later. Hence, the elapsed time in this case between the
    demand and the appellant’s first attempt to provide a breath sample was at most
    six or seven minutes, not ten minutes as found by the trial judge.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[3]</span></a>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regardless of the precise time, the first attempt was
    well within the periods of time that have been said to comply with the
    legislation.  See e.g. <i>R. v. Singh</i>,
    [2005] O.J. No.&nbsp;4787 (C.A.), eleven minutes from demand to the arrival of
    the ASD and a further six minutes to testing; <i>R. v. Pilon</i>, [2006] O.J.
    No. 701 (S.C.J.), five minutes to the arrival of the ASD and a further two
    minutes to testing; and in <i>R. v. Latour</i>, <i>supra</i>, eight minutes
    from demand to the arrival of the ASD and a further four minutes to testing.<span
style='font-size:13.5pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As in <i>Latour</i>, <i>supra</i>, the question to be asked is whether, in
    the circumstances, the police officer was in a position to require that a
    breath sample be provided “forthwith”, that is, before there was any realistic
    opportunity for the appellant to consult counsel. The answer, in our view, is
    “yes”. The machine was at the scene and ready for use within six or seven
    minutes of the demand.  The demand was
    made at 2:35&nbsp;a.m.  On the record in
    this case, any attempt by the appellant to contact and consult counsel within
    the space of six or seven minutes, at that time in the morning, would have been
    futile.  The proof of that lies in the
    appellant’s attempt to contact a lawyer after he had been arrested at
    2:43&nbsp;a.m. and taken to the station pursuant to a breathalyser demand.  According to the evidence, at the station,
    it took the appellant “a lot of effort to get his phone call to his lawyer” and
    “he phoned more than one number to try to get through”.  Nothing on this record leads us to believe
    that the situation would have been different had the appellant attempted to
    contact and consult with counsel at the roadside.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In coming to this
    conclusion, we consider it important to draw a distinction between a detainee
    having “a chance to call counsel” and a detainee being able to “consult with”
    counsel. The trial judge was under the impression that in deciding whether, in
    the circumstances, there was a realistic opportunity for the appellant to
    consult counsel, all that was required was that he be able to “call” counsel in
    the few minutes it took for the ASD to arrive and be readied for use. With
    respect, we think that the trial judge erred in that regard. The question he
    should have asked is whether, in all the circumstances, there was a realistic
    opportunity for the appellant, in the space of six or seven minutes, to
    contact, seek and receive advice from counsel. Had the trial judge framed the
    issue that way, he would, in our view, have decided the s.&nbsp;10(b) issue
    differently. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In sum, we are
    satisfied that the demand made by the police officer was a valid demand under
    s. 254(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and the breath sample was provided
    forthwith, i.e. before there was any realistic opportunity for the appellant to
    consult counsel. Contrary to the position taken by the courts below, there were
    no <i>Charter</i> violations here. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to address
    the s. 24(2) issue.</p>

  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><a href="#_ftnref1"
name="_ftn1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a>   In the brief three-minute interval between
    the time of the demand and the arrival of the ASD, the appellant asked the
    officer if he “should call his lawyer on [his cell phone]”.  The officer replied, “that won’t be
    necessary”.</p>
</div>
<div id=ftn2>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><a href="#_ftnref2"
name="_ftn2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a>  The word “forthwith” carries with it a sense
    of immediacy. In <i>R. v. Danychuk</i> (2004), 183 C.C.C. (3d) 337 at 342 (Ont. C.A.), Blair J.A. took the word
    “forthwith” to mean “as soon as reasonably practicable or within a reasonable
    time having regard to the provision and the circumstances of the case”.  In <i>R.
    v. George</i> (2004), 187 C.C.C. (3d) 289 at 295 (Ont. C.A.), Gillese J.A.
    stated that “to be ‘forthwith’, the demand must be that the detainee provide a
    sample after ‘a short period of detention’, if not ‘immediately’.”</p>

<div id=ftn3>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><a href="#_ftnref3"

    into account the fact that the appellant blew three times before providing a
    sample suitable for analysis. While the third sample was likely provided at
    about the ten-minute mark, the first unsuccessful attempt would have occurred
    sooner.  </p>
