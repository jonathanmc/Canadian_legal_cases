  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span>On appeal from the conviction
    entered on May 15, 1999 by Justice John G.J. O’Driscoll of the Superior Court
    of Justice, sitting with a jury.</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span>BY THE COURT:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the early morning of December 17, 1995, a gunman with a
    semi-automatic rifle shot at three men smoking outside a restaurant.&nbsp; Two
    of the men were injured by ricocheting bullets and the third, the apparent
    target, was killed by numerous shots fired at close range. &nbsp;The Crown’s
    case rested essentially on the testimony of one of the men injured.  He testified that he recognized the
    appellant as the shooter.&nbsp; Earlier that night at a club, the victim and
    the appellant had been involved in an altercation, apparently over an unpaid
    debt. &nbsp;The appellant and the three men were all known to each other.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An unusual feature of this one-year trial (including
    two months of pre-trial motions) was that the only witness to identify the appellant
    as the shooter refused, over a period of four days, to answer questions on
    cross-examination.&nbsp; The witness was ultimately held in contempt of court,
    but the trial judge dismissed a defence motion to exclude his evidence.  Another unusual feature of the trial was the
    rancour that existed between the trial judge and defence counsel.&nbsp; The
    trial was also characterized by numerous motions and applications brought by
    the defence, mostly without success, including a recusal motion on the basis of
    reasonable apprehension of bias, a mistrial application and an application for
    a directed verdict.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On May 15, 1999, a jury found the appellant guilty of
    one count of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder in relation
    to the early morning shooting.&nbsp; The appellant appeals his
    convictions.&nbsp; For the reasons that follow, we would allow the appeal and
    order a new trial.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span>The Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the evening of December 16, 1995, Tommy Vo (“the
    deceased”), Chuong Van Chu and Van Vi Huynh went to the Casa Blanca night club
    in Scarborough.&nbsp; At the club, Vo had a dispute with Tien Dung Duong (“the
    appellant” or the “the accused”).&nbsp; The appellant allegedly owed Vo money
    and Vo was seen hitting the appellant in the face.  Security personnel intervened before a fight could break
    out.  Vo and the appellant left the club
    separately with their respective friends.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The manager of the Casa Blanca club, Vic Termini, and a
    security guard at the club, Cheech Sun, testified that they heard the appellant
    threaten to kill Vo.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Vo and his friends drove back to Toronto and at
    approximately 2:30 a.m., while in the car, they decided to go to the Jun Jun
    Restaurant, a popular late night eatery at Broadview and Gerrard streets.&nbsp;
    At about 3:30 a.m., the three men went outside the restaurant and stood in a
    small outdoor alcove to smoke a heroin-laced cigarette.&nbsp; A man armed with
    a semi automatic rifle emerged from an alley and began shooting at them.&nbsp;
    Vo, seemingly the intended target of the shooting, was shot at least fifteen
    times. &nbsp;The shooter dropped the gun beside Vo’s head.&nbsp; Chu was struck
    in the knee, probably by a ricocheting bullet.&nbsp; He lost a lot of blood and
    required extensive surgery.&nbsp; Huynh suffered a minor injury to his back.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three days later, the appellant was arrested and
    charged with the offences.&nbsp; No forensic evidence linking him to the murder
    or the scene was ever discovered.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span>The Trial</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown relied exclusively on the identification evidence
    provided by Chu and evidence of motive based on the dispute between the
    appellant and Vo at the Casa Blanca.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence took the position that Chu’s identification was
    unbelievable and unreliable.&nbsp; During his examination-in-chief, Chu was
    declared an adverse witness and was cross-examined by the Crown.&nbsp; However,
    he essentially refused to be cross-examined by the defence.&nbsp; The defence
    also attacked the evidence of Vic Termini, the Casa Blanca club manager (on the
    basis that originally he had told the police nothing had happened at the club
    and later changed his story after arrangements had been made by the police to
    assist him with outstanding charges he was facing) and particularly the
    evidence of Cheech Sun, the club security guard (on the basis that he was an
    unreliable witness).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence claimed that the appellant had only a
    limited and unlikely opportunity to have committed the offence.&nbsp; The
    shooting occurred approximately two hours after Vo, Chu and Huynh left the Casa
    Blanca.&nbsp; The decision to eat at the Jun Jun was made during their journey
    downtown from the Casa Blanca and the appellant could not have known their
    destination.&nbsp; According to Cheech Sun, the appellant was wearing a blue
    shirt and jeans and left the Casa Blanca in a black Japanese car with his
    friends.&nbsp; According to Chu, the shooter was wearing a brown and white lumber
    jacket/shirt and came out of a white four-door American sedan.&nbsp; The
    defence argued that for the appellant to be the person who murdered Vo, not
    only would the appellant have had to have had the good fortune to run into Vo
    at the Jun Jun, but also would have had to obtain a change of clothes, a
    different car and a large MAK-90 gun between leaving the Casa Blanca and
    arriving at the Jun Jun. &nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence strongly objected to a </span><span><i>KGB</i> ruling regarding a statement given
    by Cheech Sun to the police which had the effect of strengthening the evidence
    of motive.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence also objected to the admission, as
    narrative, of a body of evidence regarding the post-shooting search for the
    appellant by the police.&nbsp; Other objections related to the charge to the
    jury.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the end of the Crown’s case, the appellant applied
    for a directed verdict on the basis that the evidence of Chu should be excluded
    and, without it, a reasonable jury properly instructed could not convict.&nbsp;
    The application was dismissed.&nbsp; The appellant then brought a </span><span><i>Corbett</i> application and an application
    to introduce evidence of third party suspects.&nbsp; Both applications were
    dismissed.&nbsp; The appellant then elected to call no evidence in his defence. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During the trial, there was palpable antagonism between
    defence counsel (not counsel on the appeal) and the trial judge, who, at times,
    expressed contempt for defence counsel, often in the presence of the
    jury.&nbsp; The defence argued that the charge to the jury was unfair and
    unbalanced.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span>The Grounds of Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal raises the following grounds of appeal:</span></p>
  <p><span>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s errors regarding the evidence of Chu;</span></p>
  <p><span>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s errors regarding the evidence of
    Cheech Sun;</span></p>
  <p><span>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third party suspect testimony;</span></p>
  <p><span>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The post shooting evidence;</span></p>
  <p><span>5.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The tenor of the proceedings and the charge to the jury; and</span></p>
  <p><span>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s directions on the burden (standard)
    of proof.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span>1.         The trial judge’s errors regarding the evidence of Chu</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant
    argues that the trial judge erred by ruling that Chu’s evidence was admissible
    despite Chu’s refusal to be cross-examined.  Even if Chu’s evidence was admissible, the appellant contends that the
    trial judge erred by failing to give an appropriate direction to the jury
    warning of the serious dangers posed by his evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During his
    examination-in-chief, Chu behaved strangely at times, laughing inappropriately,
    pausing for long periods without responding to questions, and covering his
    face.  Toward the end of his
    examination-in-chief, Chu surprised everyone, including the Crown and the
    police, by stating that six years before the murder, he had become “an agent
    for Asian crime.”  Over the appellant’s
    objection, the trial judge directed that the police interview Chu to
    investigate this assertion.  A police
    officer who worked for the Asian Crime unit later testified that Chu was not an
    informer or police agent.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After an interruption
    of ten days, the Crown closed its examination-in-chief of Chu without asking
    any further questions.  On
    cross-examination, Chu answered questions in a halting fashion for an hour.  After a further interruption of several
    days, the cross-examination resumed.  Chu sporadically responded to questions for half an hour.  Thereafter, he refused to answer any
    questions.  Defence counsel continued to
    pose questions over four days but Chu refused to respond.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At various
    points in the attempted cross-examination, the trial judge took steps to
    encourage or coerce Chu to respond.  On
    several occasions, the trial judge attempted to explain to Chu the importance
    of responding to counsel’s questions.  The trial judge warned Chu several times that he could be cited for
    contempt if he continued to refuse to answer.  The trial judge arranged for a lawyer to meet with Chu to provide him
    legal advice.  Despite these efforts,
    Chu remained silent.  The trial judge
    ultimately cited him for contempt. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence counsel
    moved for a ruling that Chu’s evidence was “no evidence” due to his refusal to
    be cross-examined, but the trial judge found that motion to be premature as Chu
    might change his mind.  Chu was brought
    back before the jury on two occasions but remained silent for the duration of
    the trial. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the
    conclusion of the Crown’s case, defence counsel moved for a ruling that Chu’s
    evidence be struck and the proceedings be stayed for breach of the appellant’s
    ss. 7 and 11(d) <i>Charter</i> rights.  The trial judge dismissed this motion.  In his ruling, the trial judge reviewed the authorities, concluded that
    he had the discretion to admit Chu’s evidence despite Chu’s refusal to be
    cross-examined, and ruled that any unfairness to the appellant could be dealt
    with by way of an appropriate instruction to the jury. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span><i><span
lang=EN-US>(a) Did the trial judge err by ruling Chu’s evidence to be
    admissible?</span></i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The right of the
    defence to cross-examine witnesses for the prosecution is fundamental to our
    adversarial system of justice: see <i>R. v. Lyttle</i> (2004), 180 C.C.C. (3d)
    476 at para. 2 (S.C.C.), “[T]he right of an accused to cross-examine witnesses
    for the prosecution – without significant and unwarranted constraint – is an
    essential component of the right to make full answer and defence.”  See also <i>R. v. Osolin</i></span><span> (1993)</span><span>, 86 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at 517 (S.C.C.):
    “Cross-examination must be permitted so that an accused can make full answer
    and defence.  The opportunity to
    cross-examine witnesses is fundamental to providing a fair trial to an
    accused.”  It follows that the failure
    of a witness to respond to questions put on cross-examination calls for close
    scrutiny to ensure that the fair trial rights of the accused are protected.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The leading
    Canadian case on the evidentiary status of evidence from an unresponsive
    witness is <i>R. v. Hart</i> (1999), 135 C.C.C. (3d) 377 (N.S. C.A.), applied
    by this court in <i>R. v. Cameron</i> (2006), 208 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at paras
    21-22, 52 (Ont. C.A.).  In </span><span><i>R.
    v. Hart</i></span><span>,
    Cromwell J.A. comprehensively reviewed Canadian, English and American
    authorities on this issue.  Cromwell
    J.A. then concluded, at 410, that under both the common law and the <i>Charter</i>,
    “there is no short, dispositive ‘test’ for whether these rights [the right to a
    fair trial and the right to make full answer and defence] have been denied or
    to determine the proper response.”  Rather, the matter is “for the discretion of the trial judge taking
    account of all relevant considerations.”  Cromwell J.A. identified three general factors to be considered:</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the reason for the unresponsiveness;</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the impact of the unresponsiveness; and</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the possibilities of ameliorative action.</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span>We shall consider the application of these
    factors to the circumstances of the present case. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span><i><span lang=EN-US>(i) Reason for the unresponsiveness</span></i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before admitting the
    evidence of a witness whom the accused has not had a full opportunity to
    cross-examine, the trial judge is required to consider the reason for the lack
    of response.  As Cromwell J.A. explained
    in <i>R. v. Hart</i></span><span>, </span><span><i>supra</i></span><span> at 410:
    “The reason for the unresponsiveness is somewhat analogous to the necessity
    criterion for the admissibility of hearsay evidence.  Before evidence is admitted without a full opportunity to
    cross-examine, there should be a valid and important reason for doing so.”  If the Crown is responsible for the
    witness’s unresponsiveness or if the unresponsiveness can be blamed on the
    witness, that is a factor that weighs against admitting the evidence: see <i>R.
    v. Hart</i> at 392-3.  On the other
    hand, if the lack of response to cross-examination is due to illness, age,
    disability, or to the conduct of the defence, and the other factors are
    satisfied, there is a tendency to admit the evidence: see <i>R. v. Hart</i> at
    411-12; <i>R. v. Cameron</i></span><span>, </span><span><i>supra</i></span><span> at para. 23; <i>R. v. Yu</i> (2002), 171
    C.C.C. (3d) 90 (Alta. C.A.).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar,
    the reason for Chu’s unresponsiveness was unclear.  Chu had been in protective custody for over two years before he
    testified and there was some suggestion (but no evidence) that he suffered from
    mental illness.  In his ruling and in
    his instructions to the jury, the trial judge stated that Chu’s silence was the
    product of fear and strongly implied that Chu’s fear was caused by the
    appellant.  We agree with the
    appellant’s submission that this was entirely speculative on the part of the
    trial judge.  There was no evidence on
    the record to support the suggestion that the appellant was somehow responsible
    for whatever fears Chu may have had or for Chu’s refusal to be cross-examined.  Indeed, one would have thought that if Chu’s
    silence was caused by his fear of the appellant, he would have clammed up <i>before</i> testifying that the appellant was the murderer.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge
    also suggested that defence counsel precipitated Chu’s silence by insisting on
    questioning Chu about being a police informer.  This is difficult to reconcile with the fact that Chu volunteered his
    alleged informer status during his examination-in-chief.  Moreover, although defence counsel did focus
    on the informer issue, Chu also refused to answer questions about other issues. </span></p>

    the extent that the trial judge based his ruling on attributing blame for Chu’s
    unresponsiveness to the appellant, he erred.  There was no evidence capable of supporting a finding that the cause of
    Chu’s unresponsiveness was that the appellant had somehow threatened Chu or
    caused Chu to fear for his safety. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was also no
    evidence capable of supporting a finding that Chu’s lack of response was due to
    illness, infirmity, or some other cause that would relieve Chu of blame.  In the end, we are left with this situation:
    for some unexplained reason, for which neither the Crown nor the defence were
    responsible, Chu refused to be cross-examined.  Blame or responsibility for this state of affairs can only be laid with
    Chu.  This is a factor tending to
    support the exclusion of the evidence.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span><i><span lang=EN-US>(ii) Impact of the unresponsiveness</span></i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v.
    Hart</i>, </span><span><i>supra </i></span><span>at 412, Cromwell J.A. explained: “The central
    considerations for the trial judge under this heading are the importance of the
    evidence to the case and whether there is a satisfactory basis, notwithstanding
    the unresponsiveness, upon which the trier of fact can evaluate the
    evidence.”  In <i>R. v. Stretton and
    McCallion</i> (1988), 86 Cr. App. R. 7 at 11 (C.A.), the English Court of
    Appeal held that the trial judge was correct in acknowledging the proposition
    that evidence should be ignored if the accused was deprived of the opportunity
    to probe and test a witness so as to enable the jury “to judge fairly of her
    credibility”.  The Court of Appeal
    described this approach as “a matter of common sense and fairness.”  The importance of the evidence in the case
    must also be considered.  “The more
    important the evidence to the prosecution’s case, the more reluctant the trial
    judge should be to allow it to be given without full cross-examination”: <i>R.
    v. Hart</i> at 412.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>R. v. Hart</i></span><span>, </span><span><i>supra</i></span><span>, like many cases in this area, dealt with a
    witness who initially responded to questions put on cross-examination, but then
    clammed up.  The accused, therefore, was
    afforded only a limited right of cross-examination.  In <i>R. v. Cameron</i>, </span><span><i>supra</i></span><span>, an expert witness died before his
    cross-examination was completed.  It is
    common ground here that Chu’s silence effectively denied rather than limited
    the appellant’s right to cross-examination.  Where the lack of a complete cross-examination leaves the trier of fact
    with an insufficient basis upon which to evaluate the evidence of the witness,
    the witness’s evidence should be excluded.  For example, in <i>R. v. Wyatt</i> (1997), 115 C.C.C. (3d) 288 at para.
    56 (B.C.C.A.), “having concluded that the accused could not test the
    complainant’s evidence on the central issue in the case, the only alternative
    was to issue a stay of proceedings.”</span></p>

'><span>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Chu was the
    Crown’s key witness: without Chu’s evidence, the Crown’s case against the
    appellant was very thin.  Chu’s evidence
    was open to attack from a variety of perspectives.  The appellant was deprived of the opportunity to cross-examine
    Chu on every crucial issue, including: his identification of the appellant as
    the shooter, his description of the events leading up to the shooting, his
    prior inconsistent statements, his prior relationship with and his animosity
    toward the appellant, and his prior criminal record and history of violence.  Moreover, why did he insist on speaking only
    to a specific police officer in the hospital, and why was he intent on being
    admitted to the witness protection program?  On the defence theory that Chu lured the victim to the place where he
    was shot, Chu himself was a suspect.  Chu’s silence deprived the appellant of the opportunity to probe any of
    these areas or to test Chu’s credibility in any meaningful way.</span></p>

    to admit Chu’s evidence and in his instructions to the jury, the trial judge
    minimized the prejudice to the appellant caused by Chu’s refusal to be
    cross-examined.  The trial judge’s
    opinion was undoubtedly affected by his negative view of defence counsel’s
    tactics and by the rancorous relationship that developed.  The trial judge considered defence counsel’s
    other cross-examinations to have been inept and ineffective and he concluded
    that even if Chu had been prepared to answer, the cross-examination would have
    gone nowhere. </span></p>

    also appears to have assumed that unless Chu completely resiled from his
    evidence in chief that the appellant was the shooter, the cross-examination
    would be ineffective.  In his ruling he
    stated:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>[T]here is but one issue in this case.  The hard core of Chu’s evidence is this: “I
    know the accused – I have known him for sometime before the shooting – I have
    driven him home.  He was the person who
    shot me – he is the one who shot my friend.”</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>If Chu were to face the world’s best
    cross-examiner for an unlimited period, I cannot imagine Chu backing off one
    iota from those assertions.  He has been
    consistent and adamant since December 18, 1995.  Why would he change now?</span></p>

    appellant that the trial judge erred by unduly minimizing the prejudice to the
    appellant caused by Chu’s unresponsiveness.  The trial judge’s suggestion that any cross-examination of Chu was
    unlikely to produce a dramatic “Perry Mason” style cross-examination resulting
    in a complete capitulation by the witness is an entirely unrealistic
    standard.  As we have observed, Chu’s
    evidence was vulnerable to attack from many different directions and the
    Crown’s case depended almost entirely upon the jury accepting his
    evidence.  All the defence needed to do
    was to undermine Chu’s credibility to the point of raising a reasonable
    doubt.  Contrary to the trial judge’s
    claim that he was taking a “common sense and realistic assessment of the likely
    impact of the cross-examination”, he posited an unrealistic and unreachable
    standard that could rarely if ever be met.  This, in our view, represents an error in principle that significantly
    undermines the basis for his ruling.</span></p>

    the jury on this point was completely inadequate.  Indeed, it is difficult to imagine any instruction, short perhaps
    of telling the jury that it had to disregard Chu’s evidence entirely, that
    would be adequate in the circumstances of this case.  Chu was the key witness, his credibility was vulnerable to attack

    calls for a careful assessment of the reasons for admitting the evidence, the
    impact of the unresponsiveness, and the possibility of ameliorative
    action.  That assessment is best left to
    the trial judge who is clearly in the best position to assess and weigh these

    judge’s ruling which leads the appellate court to conclude that the ultimate

    view undermine the trial judge’s ruling to admit Chu’s evidence.  The trial judge unfairly placed the blame
    for Chu’s silence on the appellant and minimized, to the point of entirely
    ignoring, the serious impact of Chu’s unresponsiveness upon the appellant’s
    right to a fair trial and right to make full answer and defence.  As we explain in greater detail below, the

    probed and tested Mr. Chu’s evidence so as to enable you to judge fairly of his

    defence was deprived of the opportunity of properly testing and probing Chu’s
    evidence, then you would simply set aside and ignore all of Chu’s evidence as
    if he never came to the witness box.  On
    the other hand, you may feel that during the time that Mr. Chu was answering
    questions put to him by Crown counsel and the questions put to Chu by the

    judge quoted from Chu’s examination-in-chief but failed to mention Chu’s
    refusal to answer questions on cross-examination.  The trial judge effectively told the jury that it could safely
    assume that Chu’s evidence would not have been shaken by cross-examination.  The trial judge left the jury completely in the
    dark as to what an effective cross-examination might achieve by way of
    undermining Chu’s credibility and raising a reasonable doubt.  He repeated the error he made in his ruling

  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sun’s first interview with the police was on January
    20, 1996.  He told them he did not
    recall any fight occurring at the club that night;</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One month later, on February 19, he spoke to Patricia
    Quinton, a civilian employee at Police Headquarters, about an unrelated
    matter.  He raised with her the moral
    dilemma of knowing about a crime but being afraid to talk to the police about
    it.  Sun then stated that he had
    information about the murder at the Jun Jun, so Quinton put him in touch with
    Det. McGuire;</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next day, February 20, 1996, Sun met with Det.
    McGuire at headquarters for forty-five minutes.  Sun was neither told of the criminal consequences of making a
    false statement nor placed under oath.  </span><span>Det. McGuire did, however, tell Sun
    the importance of telling the truth.  Sun
    did not want to be video or audio taped and refused to review and sign Det. </span></p>
  class=Section2>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span>·McGuire’s notes.  Det. McGuire wrote up the interview in three and a half pages of
    foolscap.    </span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to Det. McGuire, Sun told him that he was
    working at the Casa Blanca and heard of a problem over his radio.  He went to the scene and found the appellant
    holding a towel up to his face, complaining “that fucking guy just punched me
    in the eyes.”  He said he was “gonna get
    him” and “kill the fucker”.  A friend of
    the appellant approached Sun and pointed out the man who had punched the
    appellant.  Sun recognized him from
    other incidents at the club.  After, he
    realized that he was the man killed later that night.  The man had left the club before the appellant.  The appellant told Christine (the appellant’s
    girlfriend) and another woman to go home and then he left in a friend’s
    car.  According to Sun, as the appellant
    left he said, “See you later Cheech.  Don’t worry I’m gonna go kill this bastard.”  A few days later Sun saw “Duc”, who told him that the appellant
    and John were in jail and wanted to know if “we” had said anything.  Duc also told Sun that John “went down to
    the restaurant with them.”</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On several occasions over the next two years, Sun
    expressed reluctance to provide the police with further information or a more
    formal statement, claiming that he would fear for his life if he testified;</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April 14, 1998 Sun agreed to meet Det. McGuire
    again.  He gave a videotaped statement
    under oath, after being cautioned.  In
    this statement Sun said essentially what he was to say at trial – he recalled
    few specifics of the evening but remembered some kind of incident involving the
    appellant in the washroom;</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following this statement Sun told Det. McGuire more
    than once that he intended to avoid testifying and was still scared.  Just prior to being called as a witness at
    trial, he told Det. McGuire that someone close to the appellant (who was also
    under subpoena) had offered to pay for him to “go away for a while”.  Det. McGuire believed that this person was
    likely Andy Trinh.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, Sun testified that there was an altercation
    involving the appellant in the club washroom that evening.  By the time Sun reached the washroom, the
    appellant was sitting on the edge of a pool table outside holding a towel to
    his face.  Sun recalled that the
    appellant was angry, spoke of the dispute, and called the other participant a
    “fucking asshole.”  The Crown then
    showed him Det. McGuire’s notes from his February 20, 1996 interview, whereupon
    Sun testified:   “I don’t remember what [the
    appellant’s] words were.  I guess he
    said: ‘I want to kill this bastard.’”  He added, however, that the appellant had calmed down by the time he was
    escorted from the club. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown then sought and received permission to cross-examine
    Sun as an adverse witness pursuant to s. 9(1) of the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i></span><span>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5.<i>  </i>By the end of his cross-examination by
    the Crown, Sun had adopted virtually all of the contents of his February 20,
    1996 statement.  Then, during his
    cross-examination by the defence, he reverted to where he had begun – his
    memory was <i>not</i> refreshed by the contents of his statement.  He added that he had a terrible memory,
    explaining that, “when people make a suggestion, I agree.”  It was at the end of this cross-examination
    that the Crown applied to have the February 20, 1996 statement admitted for the
    truth of its contents as a principled exception to the hearsay rule.</span></p>

'><span>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During submissions on the application, the defence conceded
    that the statement met the test of necessity.  The trial judge ruled that the prior statement made by Sun to Det.
    McGuire on February 20, 1996 was admissible for the truth of its contents.  In considering the statement’s reliability,
    the trial judge reviewed Sun’s background, his relationship with the appellant
    and his contacts with Det. McGuire.  He
    concluded that Sun had been afraid to implicate the appellant because of the
    latter’s gang connections.  He found
    that Sun had decided to “unburden his conscience” to Quinton but when he spoke
    to Det. McGuire, refused to provide a “formal statement” because he was
    afraid.  According to the trial judge’s
    ruling, in giving the statement in April, 1998, Sun decided to take himself
    “out of play” by claiming to remember very little of the events.  In this vein, the trial judge continued:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>In the witness box, whether before the jury or
    on the <i>voir dire</i>, Sun denied any fear
    of anything at any time.  In my view,
    Sun was afraid to admit that he was afraid and he is still afraid to admit
    fear.</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span>He concluded:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>I am quite aware of the general principles set
    out by Lamer, C.J.C. in <i>K.G.B.</i> regarding “reliability”.  I am aware
    that on February 20, 1996 there was no oath and there was no video or audio or
    signed statement.   </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>I am also aware that Lamer, C.J.C. said at page
    288 of <i>K.G.B.</i> that:   </span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span>The question of reliability is a matter for the
    trial judge to be decided on the particular circumstances of the case.</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=center style='text-align:center'><span>. . . . .</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>In my view, the totality of the events of
    February 19, 1996 and February 20, 1996, the words and the actions of Mr. Sun
    before and since that time as disclosed on the <i>voir dire</i>, and notwithstanding the absence of an oath and the
    absence of a video or audio recording or a formal statement, Crown counsel has
    persuaded me, on a balance of probabilities, of the threshold reliability of
    Mr. Sun’s February 20, 1996 statement.</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span>The trial judge “took solace” in other evidence
    of reliability revealed through corroborating trial evidence.  We will discuss some of this evidence
    shortly.</span></p>

    re-cross-examination, the Crown was given considerable latitude (over defence
    counsel’s objections) and Sun once again changed his position, claiming to have
    a (refreshed) memory of virtually all of the contents of the February 1996
    statement.</span></p>

    Charron J. stated in <i>R. v. Khelawon</i></span><span>, 2006 SCC 57 at para. 38, when the out-of-court statement is
    adopted:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>The statement itself is not evidence, the

'><span>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='font-size:13.5pt;'>However, Sun’s adoption of his statement at the end of his re&#8209;cross&#8209;examination
    by the Crown cannot be regarded in isolation.  Having regard to the unusual sequence of events we have outlined, it is
    appropriate that we consider the admissibility of the February 20, 1996
    statement for the truth of its contents.  Had the statement not been admitted for its truth as an exception to the
    hearsay rule, it is doubtful that Sun would have finally adopted it. </span></span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span><i><span lang=EN-US>The principled exception to the hearsay rule</span></i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When no traditional exception to the hearsay rule
    applies, hearsay evidence can only be admitted under the principled exception
    to the hearsay rule.  That rule requires
    the proponent to establish on a balance of probabilities both the necessity and
    reliability of the evidence sought to be admitted.  In broad terms, t</span><span>he reliability requirement can generally be met on the basis of two
    different grounds.  The first is where
    the circumstances in which the statement came about negate the possibility that
    the declarant was untruthful or mistaken: see e.g. <i>R. v. Khan</i> (1990), 59
    C.C.C. (3d) 92 (S.C.C.).  The second is
    where there are circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness, or an adequate
    substitute, allowing for sufficient testing of the evidence.  Three circumstantial guarantees of
    trustworthiness are generally considered.  They are the taking of an oath, recording of the statement by videotape
    so that the demeanour of the witness can be observed, and contemporaneous
    cross-examination.  Where one of these
    circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness is lacking, the court will want to
    ensure that an adequate substitute exists.  For example, the availability of the declarant for cross-examination at
    trial or at the preliminary inquiry goes a long way to satisfying the
    requirement of an adequate substitute for contemporaneous cross-examination at
    the time the statement was made: see e.g. <i>R. v. B. (K.G.) </i></span><span>(1993),
    79 C.C.C. (3d) 257</span><span> (S.C.C.) and <i>R .v. Hawkins</i> (1996), 111 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (S.C.C.). </span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three grounds of appeal arise from the trial judge’s ruling
    admitting the statement to Det. McGuire as a principled exception to the
    hearsay rule.  They are:</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span>(i)        the trial judge erred in ruling that the
    statement was substantively admissible;</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span>(ii)       having made his ruling after Sun’s

  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span>(iii)     the trial judge erred by not instructing
    the jury to ignore the edited parts of the statement that they had heard.</span></p>

    (Ont. C.A.) Doherty J.A. summarized the standard of review for substantive
    admissibility of hearsay statements.  In
    reviewing a trial judge’s decision to admit evidence under the principled
    exception to the hearsay rule, this court, absent manifest error, must accept
    the findings of fact made by the trial judge on which the ruling is
    predicated.  The court must, however,
    apply a correctness standard to the ultimate question of whether the trial
    judge properly applied the criteria relevant to the admissibility of the
    evidence to the facts as found by the trial judge: <i>R. v. Hawkins, supra, </i>at
    160.<b>&nbsp;</b></span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span><i><span lang=EN-US>The indicia of reliability considered by the trial judge</span></i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The following extract from the trial judge’s ruling contains
    the further indicia of reliability that he found:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>1. The events of February 19 and 20, 1996 were
    within two months of the offence.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>2. There is no suggestion that there was any
    prompting of Mr. Sun by D/Sgt. McGuire or anyone else.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>3. D/Sgt. McGuire, who was in charge of the
    prosecution of this case, believed what Mr. Sun told him.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>4.  There
    is no evidence that Mr. Sun had any motive to lie.  He was not selling anything, he was not bartering anything, he
    was not trading anything.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>5. Mr. Sun was a friend of the accused.  He had no axe to grind.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>6. Mr. Sun had special knowledge - he was there
    - he spoke to the accused that night.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>7. There is no suggestion that Mr. Sun had the
    wrong person, nor the wrong date, nor the wrong time. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>8. The statement given to D/Sgt McGuire on
    February 20, 1996 has internal consistency.  There is no evidence of any collaboration by Mr. Sun with anyone.  </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>9.  The
    statement by Mr. Sun on February 20, 1996 is in sync with the evidence already
    given before the jury by the witnesses: Huynh, Chu, Termini, and the reported
    utterances of the deceased, Mr. Vo. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown concedes that the trial judge made three errors in
    the criteria he considered relevant to the admissibility of the evidence of
    Sun’s alleged prior statement.  The
    concessions and our comments on them are as follows.  1. The timing of the statement in relation to the events did not,
    as stated by the trial judge, make the statement more likely to be true.  Unlike the situation in <i>Khan, supra, </i>the
    statement was not given so close in time after the incident in issue or under
    circumstances that it was likely to be inherently reliable.  2. The fact that the police officer believed
    Sun was irrelevant to the reliability of the statement; the police officer was not
    an independent third party.  3. The
    trial judge did not advert to the absence of any attempt by the police to bring
    home to Sun the consequences which could befall him if he was untruthful.  Thus, it does not appear that the trial
    judge gave any weight to the absence of one of the circumstantial guarantees of
    trustworthiness in his ruling.  The
    trial judge erred in law by considering totally irrelevant factors and further
    erred in not addressing an important criterion pertaining to admissibility. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary to the Crown’s submission, we are of the opinion that the fact
    that Sun was present at trial and could be cross-examined did not, in the
    circumstances of this case, readily permit the jury to assess the reliability
    of his purported statement.  As stated
    by this court in <i>R. v. Conway </i></span><span>(1997),</span><span><i> </i></span><span>121 C.C.C. (3d) 397 at paras 27-29:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>[27] In <i>KGB</i>,
    Chief Justice Lamer confirmed that the lack of contemporaneous
    cross-examination is the most important of the hearsay dangers (p. 293).  He noted that it is also the most easily
    remedied by the opportunity to cross-examine at trial.  </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>[28] And on the same issue, in <i>U.(F.J.), supra, </i>Chief Justice Lamer put
    it this way [at p. 116]:</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span>When a witness takes the stand at trial and,
    under oath, gives a different version of the story than one previously
    recorded, doubt is cast on the credibility of the witness and on the truth of
    both versions of the story.  This is
    what effective cross-examiners hope to achieve.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>[29] This case is different.  There are not two versions.  [The witness] did not give a different
    account at trial.  There is the
    statement of December 11, 1994 and the statement at trial “I don’t
    remember.”  How does cross-examination
    of the witness at trial afford the trier of fact a satisfactory basis for
    evaluating the truth of the prior statement when the evidence of the witness at
    trial is “I don’t remember”?  Cross-examination becomes, to a large extent, an exercise in futility
    and does not serve as a substitute for contemporaneous cross-examination on the
    prior statement, as it does in most cases.   <i> </i>  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the most important substitute for contemporaneous
    cross-examination, cross-examination of the witness at trial, was not possible
    most of the time Sun was in the witness box because he said he did not remember
    what was said on the night of the murder.  While Sun purported to have a refreshed memory after the February 20<sup>th</sup> statement was admitted for the truth of its contents, we cannot overlook the
    fact that the trial judge then refused to allow the defence to re-open the
    cross-examination.  Once the February 20<sup>th</sup> statement was admitted for the truth of its contents, the jury was, in effect,
    being asked to choose between Sun’s contradictory trial evidence and what he
    had said in the February 20<sup>th</sup> statement.  This meant that the intervening statement captured on videotape
    two years later in April 1998 acquired new significance. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When Sun gave that videotaped statement and the police pressed him to
    recall the events recounted in his February 20<sup>th</sup> statement, he explained
    that he had seen no need for precision at the time.  He described his earlier statement as a “pretty accurate account”
    that he had recounted during a “general conversation” and at one point said he
    did not recall the exact words spoken.  The defence ought to have been able to use the videotaped April 1998
    statement to counteract the admission of the February 20, 1996 statement for
    the truth of its contents and to have the entire videotape admitted into
    evidence.  The effect of the trial
    judge’s refusal to allow the defence to do so was to allow the Crown to split
    its case without the defence having an opportunity to respond.  As Sun’s memory had been refreshed, fairness
    dictated that the defence be allowed to re&#8209;open the cross&#8209;examination.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A further error occurred with respect to the February 20<sup>th</sup> statement.  A portion of Sun’s unedited
    prior statements contained double hearsay that Sun attributed to Duc.  Sun claimed that Duc told him that the
    appellant and John Pham had gone to the Jun Jun restaurant after leaving the
    Casa Blanca.  The trial judge initially
    refused to edit the statements on the basis that the double hearsay comments
    could not be cleanly edited and promised to deal with the problem by way of a
    direction to the jury.  The jury heard
    the statements in full and was given a copy of Det. McGuire’s complete written
    notes.  After the Crown’s re-examination
    of Sun, the trial judge ruled that the notes could not be filed as an exhibit
    and ruled the statements that Sun attributed to Duc inadmissible.  Nevertheless, the trial judge refused to
    give an immediate instruction on the non- evidentiary status of the edits.  Instead, in the absence of the jury, he had
    the copies of the statements retrieved from the jury room or from the
    courtroom.  He only told the jury that a
    legal ruling had necessitated the retrieval of their copies of Det. McGuire’s
    notes of the interview.  In his closing
    address, the Crown referred to the impugned passages that had been edited out,
    making the need for the promised instruction by the trial judge all the more
    important.  The trial judge gave no
    limiting instruction in his charge to the jury, nor did he correct the Crown’s
    erroneous references to the unedited portion of the statements.  The general instructions that the trial
    judge did give concerning hearsay did not equip the jury to deal with the
    hearsay in the February 20, 1996 statement they had heard or the Crown’s
    references to the passages that had been edited out.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, during their deliberations the jury asked to hear Sun’s entire
    videotaped April 14, 1998 statement but could not since only parts of it had
    been put to Sun.  The trial judge’s
    response to the jury’s request was not responsive to their actual question, and
    his references to the decision in <i>KGB</i></span><span> were not an appropriate response.</span><span></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We note that the Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Khelawon,
    supra, </i>which modified to some extent the principled exception to the
    hearsay rule, was released towards the end of argument in this appeal but was
    not the subject of substantive submissions by counsel.  In view of the errors we have identified,
    the analysis mandated by <i>Khelawon </i>would make no difference to this
    appeal.  The admissibility of Sun’s
    February 20<sup>th</sup> statement may or may not be an issue at the new trial
    we order here.  If it is an issue, the
    admissibility of the February 20, 1996 statement will be for the trial judge to
    determine on the basis of the <i>Khelawon</i> approach and the record and
    evidence led at the new trial. </span><span><span> </span></span></p>

    the narrative.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

    been led or admitted.&nbsp; The persons referred to in the evidence of the
    police officers were never called as witnesses.&nbsp; This evidence was highly
    prejudicial.&nbsp; It had little or no relevance to the murder and only served
    to inflame the jury.&nbsp; </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This issue is much simplified as the Crown acknowledges
    that the “narrative” rule did not apply and much of this evidence was hearsay,
    double hearsay and unsupported opinions.&nbsp; None of it came within any
    recognized hearsay exception. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In its closing address, the Crown reviewed this
    evidence in detail as consciousness of guilt.  The Crown referred to the “man-hunt”, the contact with U.S customs
    regarding border crossings because of flight concerns, Det. McGuire’s foot
    chase with his gun drawn, the use of police dogs, and the investigation of Andy
    Trinh and John Pham for harbouring the accused and assisting him to avoid
    justice.&nbsp; This evidence and the Crown’s closing address were bound to
    prejudice the appellant in the eyes of the jury.&nbsp; It created the aura of a
    dangerous man at large trying to evade capture being hunted down by a
    relentless police force.&nbsp; </span></p>

'><span>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As if this was not enough, the trial judge, having let
    the evidence in, did not give the jury any limiting instruction on its use or
    correct the Crown for using the evidence to suggest consciousness of
    guilt.&nbsp; As a result, there was an inevitable risk that the jury would rely
    on this evidence as circumstantial evidence of guilt.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The ultimate responsibility for the admission of this

    the trial judge permitted the Crown to call after-the-fact evidence that was
    highly prejudicial and of no probative value.&nbsp; Although the trial judge
    instructed the jury to disregard the evidence in regard to consciousness of guilt,
    he failed to instruct them that they should not consider this evidence at
    all.&nbsp; Further, having taken the evidence away from their consideration on
    the issue of consciousness of guilt, he nonetheless brought the evidence back
    for the jury’s consideration when he later reviewed the Crown’s overall
    position.&nbsp; The court gave effect to this ground of appeal.</span></p>

    flagrant.&nbsp; The review of the inadmissible evidence was done by the Crown,
    but the trial judge did not give any instruction on its use.  By failing to correct the Crown, the trial
    judge implicitly approved of the position taken by the Crown in his
    closing.  The general instruction on hearsay
    given to the jury did nothing to remedy the prejudice to the appellant.&nbsp; The
    jury would not have known how to use this evidence.</span></p>

    initiative, investigated defence counsel’s other court commitments.&nbsp; Not
    surprisingly, counsel concluded that the trial judge’s actions were a challenge
    to counsel’s ethics.  This incident led
    to a recusal application which was dismissed.&nbsp; It would have been
    preferable if the trial judge, rather than initiating his own inquiries, had
    raised the issue with counsel to allow him to place the necessary materials

    Hostile exchanges between defence counsel and the trial judge continued
    throughout the pre-trial motions and the trial, in the absence and in the
    presence of the jury.&nbsp; Although cautioned numerous times, defence counsel
    was frequently difficult, argumentative, verbose, repetitive, self-righteous
    and even insufferable.&nbsp; On the other hand, the trial judge was dismissive,
    mocking and critical of the defence and, at a personal level, showed
    discourtesy and sarcasm.&nbsp; The trial judge and defence counsel demonstrated
    a palpable dislike for each other and the rancour, lack of civility and the
    mutual hostility carried on throughout the trial.</span></p>

    responsibility where an “unfortunately acrimonious relationship” between the
    trial judge and defence counsel developed.&nbsp; At para. 23, this court
    stated:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>It is apparent from the transcript that the
    trial judge at times became very frustrated with what he regarded as the
    truculent and obstreperous conduct of defence counsel, an assessment that
    certainly could not be described as ill-founded.&nbsp; Some of the trial
    judge’s comments could only be described as insulting and demeaning.&nbsp;
    While one can appreciate the trial judge’s annoyance with defence counsel’s
    conduct, it would have been preferable had he not risen to the bait.&nbsp;
    However annoying or irritating counsel may become, the trial judge at all times
    should control proceedings with judicious demeanour.<i> </i></span></p>

    of Crown counsel that “the administration of justice cannot be proud of the
    conduct exhibited by the trial judge and defence counsel in this trial.” </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span>b) <i>            The charge to the jury</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant takes issue with numerous parts of the charge to
    the jury.  The appellant points to the
    following examples:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>Because, the trial judge felt that
    defence counsel had made unjustified criticisms of Crown counsel in his address
    to the jury, the trial judge stated: “Crown counsel had no right of
    reply.&nbsp; Nor does he have any right to sue for libel and slander.”&nbsp; This
    comment had no place in a jury charge. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>In his address to the jury, defence
    counsel on three occasions mentioned the “Goddess of Justice” and on two
    occasions unfurled a picture with a purple background of “Justicia”, the
    Goddess of Justice.&nbsp; In his charge, the trial judge told the jury: </span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span>“It is
    true that the Goddess of Justice is always portrayed as being blindfolded to
    symbolize equal justice to every person.&nbsp; However, may I remind you, that
    the Goddess of Justice is never portrayed as being stupid.”&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>From this remark, the jury would likely
    not have been left in doubt where the trial judge stood in this case.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>When instructing the jury on how to
    assess the evidence of witnesses the trial judge asked the rhetorical question:
    “How did you view the cross-examination?&nbsp; … Was it muckraking for the sake
    of muckraking?”&nbsp; This comment was sarcastic and intended to ridicule the
    defence.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>The trial judge referred to “red
    herrings” and listed three cross-examinations in this regard.&nbsp; This matter
    should have been left for the jury to decide.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>The review of the evidence in support of
    the prosecution is far more extensive than the evidence in support of the
    defence.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>Every criticism made in the charge is
    directed to defence counsel or to the defence.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>There is no criticism of the prosecution.</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span>The Crown’s position is that when read as a
    whole the charge was fair.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We have in mind that the charge to the jury is the
    central feature in any jury trial.&nbsp; In the context of our adversarial
    process, its strength lies in its objectivity.&nbsp; There is no justification
    for jury charges that are not even-handed: see </span><span><i>R. v. Baltovich</i> (2004), 191 C.C.C. (3d)
    289 (Ont. C.A.).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This issue is not without merit.&nbsp; However, as was
    the case for the previous issue, in light of our disposition of this appeal, it
    is not necessary to resolve it.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span>6.       <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge’s
    directions on the burden (standard) of proof</span></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge stated that reasonable doubt “is not a capricious or frivolous
    doubt concocted by an irresponsible juror to avoid his or her plain duty.”  This court has found a similar instruction,
    regarding the “timid” juror, to be fraught with risk because it could carry the
    implication that “jurors who acquit are timid and may be avoiding their
    responsibilities, while courageous jurors convict”: </span></span><span><i><span lang=EN-US>R. v. Karthiresu</span></i></span><span> (2000), 129 O.A.C. 291 at 293.  Similarly, the trial judge’s direction might suggest that an
    “irresponsible juror” is likely to acquit.  Language such as this that might confuse the meaning of reasonable doubt
    or the role of the jury ought to be avoided.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge used phrases such as, “in our daily activities, we act on
    reasonable grounds” and “such a reasonable degree of certainty as men and women
    are daily accustomed to regard as sufficient in the most important concerns of
    life”.  The Supreme Court of Canada has
    disapproved of terminology that tends to equate the standard of proof beyond a
    reasonable doubt with the standards by which people make everyday decisions.  In </span></span><span><i><span lang=EN-US>R. v. Lifchus</span></i></span><span> (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at para. 24, Cory J. stated:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>Ordinarily even the most important decision of a
    lifetime are based upon carefully calculated risks.  They are made on the assumption that certain events will in all
    likelihood take place or that certain facts are in all probability true.  Yet to invite jurors to apply to a criminal
    trial the standard of proof used for even the important decisions in life runs
    the risk of significantly reducing the standard to which the prosecution must
    be held.  </span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span>Indeed,
    to liken reasonable doubt in any way to daily activities weakens the special
    significance of the criminal standard of proof unique to the legal process.</span></p>

'><span>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge also stated:</span></span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>If, at the end of the whole case and after
    considering all of the evidence, you are unable to make up your mind that the
    offences charged are committed, then you must say: “Not guilty”.  If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that
    the offences charged were committed, but you are unable to make up your minds
    that the offence was committed by Tien Dung Duong, you will have to acquit him
    because the Crown has not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span>The
    reasonable doubt standard should not be equated to being “unable to make up
    your mind” that the accused is guilty.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
    duty of the jury was to decide whether a crime had been committed and, if so,
    whether the accused committed that crime.  The trial judge went on to state:</span></span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>If through undue sympathy or other improper
    cause, you, the jury, fail to do your duty and give effect to the laws that
    have been passed for the benefit of all of the people in Canada, what would be
    the eventual result?  A state of
    uncertainty, confusion, injustice, lawlessness, and indeed, anarchy would
    eventually engulf us all.</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span>The juxtaposition of the jurors’ duty to decide
    whether the accused committed the crime with the anarchical result if they
    failed in that duty imparted the unfortunate suggestion that the jury might
    have a “duty” to convict.  Language that
