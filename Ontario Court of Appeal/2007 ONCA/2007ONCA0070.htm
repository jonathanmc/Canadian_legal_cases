    price of aquarium and water purification products supplied to the corporate
    defendants, Sera Aquaristik Canada Ltd. (“Sera Canada”) and Sera U.S.A., Inc.
    (“Sera U.S.A.”).  These products were
    supplied pursuant to an oral distribution agreement between the appellant and
    Sera Canada and Sera U.S.A. that was negotiated between Fred Tan, shareholder
    and director of both corporate defendants, and Josef Ravnak, managing director
    of the plaintiff.  Irene Tan is also a

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Tans successfully moved for summary judgment dismissing
    the claim against them personally.  The
    appellant raises three grounds of appeal:  </p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;
'>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the motion judge erred by reversing the onus and by weighing
    evidence;</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;
'>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the motion judge failed to perceive that the personal
    defendants admitted that they were parties to the oral agreement in their
    statement of defence and counterclaim;</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;
'>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the motion judge erred by failing to find that there was
    sufficient evidence to support a triable issue as to personal liability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the following reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>(1)       Onus of proof and weighing evidence</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view the motion judge did not err with respect to the
    onus of proof.  She states: “The moving
    parties must establish that there is no genuine issue requiring a trial.  The onus on the moving parties is a heavy
    one.  In response to a motion for
    summary judgment, the responding party is to put his ‘best foot forward’ and is
    required to ‘lead trump or risk losing’ [citations omitted].” That is an
    accurate statement of the law and that is precisely the test the motion judge applied.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The recent decision of this court in <i>Royal Bank of Canada v. Société Générale (Canada)</i>, [2006] O.J. No. 5081 (Q.L.)<i> </i>does not assist the appellants.  That case involved a complex $100 million
    fraud, with claims sounding in negligence, unjust enrichment and
    conversion.  This court set aside a
    summary judgment dismissing some of the claims on a variety of grounds.  One of the errors found by the court was
    that the motion judge placed the <i>legal </i>burden
    of persuasion on the responding party “to show” and “to establish” a genuine
    issue for trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the present case, the respondent had adduced sufficient
    evidence to shift the <i>tactical</i> (not the legal) burden to the appellant
    to “lead trump or risk losing”.  References by the motion judge to the failure of the appellant to
    provide documentary evidence capable of demonstrating personal liability, when
    read in the context of her recitation of the proper legal test, do not support
    the argument that she reversed the legal onus of proof on the summary judgment motion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor do I accept the submission that the trial judge engaged in
    impermissible weighing of the evidence.  She properly noted the appellant’s obligation to put to its “best foot
    forward” and concluded that“the evidence [the appellant] has adduced does not,
    and could not, raise a genuine issue for trial insofar as the Tans’ personal
    liability is concerned.”  In my view,
    fairly read as a whole, the motion judge’s reasons make it clear that, as she
    was required to do, she measured the evidence against the appropriate legal
    test and that, as she was entitled to do, she concluded that the evidence was
    simply insufficient to give rise to a triable issue.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>(2)            Admission in the pleadings</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants submit that the personal defendants admit in
    their statement of defence and counterclaim that they were parties to the oral
    contract and that this leaves open an inference that they were personally bound
    for the obligations sued upon.  I
    disagree. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant relies on the following portions of the
    statement of defence in support of this argument: “Sera Germany entered into an
    oral agreement with the Tans” for the sale and distribution of products in
    Canada; and: “The Tans entered into an oral agreement with Sera Germany
    regarding the distribution of Sera products in the United States similar to the
    agreement they had with Sera Germany regarding the Canadian market”.  The agreements referred to relate to the two
    corporate defendants (Sera U.S.A. had yet to be incorporated) having exclusive
    rights to import and distribute Sera products.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the statement of defence says nothing more that
    the Tans were involved in negotiating the distributorship agreement pursuant to
    which those products were shipped.  There is certainly no admission that the Tans personally agreed to be
    bound for the price of goods shipped to the corporate defendants pursuant to
    that distributorship agreement.  Any
    suggestion to that effect is effectively trumped by the fact that the statement
    of defence specifically pleads that the personal defendants “have no personal
    liability whatsoever to Sera Germany” and that “[a]ny obligation to Sera
    Germany for [their] payment of products was the obligation of Sera Canada or
    Sera USA”. Reading the pleading as a whole, I do not accept the submission that
    there is anything capable of amounting to an admission of personal liability
    for the obligation sued upon.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not agree that the fact that the counterclaim is advanced
    by “the defendants”, without qualification, has any bearing on the Tans’
    personal liability to the appellant for the cost of products supplied to the
    corporate defendants for the following reasons.  First, the Tans were named as defendants together with the
    corporate defendants and the counterclaim must be viewed in that light: it is framed
    in terms of a global response to the global claim advanced by the
    appellant.  By joining the counterclaim
    the personal defendants admit nothing; they are simply responding in kind to
    the attack they face.  Second, this
    argument should be considered in the light of the explicit denial of personal
    liability in the statement of defence and the absence of evidence capable of
    supporting personal liability. From that perspective, this argument appears to
    me to be nothing more that an ingenious last-ditch attempt by the appellants to
    overcome the fact that they have no evidence to support their case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I would add, however,
    that the consequence of a successful motion for summary judgment on the ground
    that the Tans were not personally liable on the agreement sued upon must be
    that they cannot be parties to that same agreement for the purposes of
    advancing the counterclaim. </p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>(<i><span style='font-weight:normal'>3)            Sufficiency of evidence to give rise
    to a triable issue.</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support of the claim of personal liability, the appellant
    offers little more than Ravnak’s bald assertion that he thought that the Tans
    were personally liable.  In <i>Guarantee Co. of North America v. Gordon
    Capital Corp.</i>, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 423<i> </i>1, at para. 31, the Supreme Court of
    Canada held that “a self-serving affidavit is not sufficient in itself to
    create a triable issue in <i>the absence of
    detailed facts and supporting evidence</i> [citations omitted].” [Emphasis
    added.]  The only additional evidence is
    that the Tans signed correspondence and purchase orders on company letterhead
    without specific qualification that they were signing “per” the corporate
    entities.  It is also submitted that
    certain documents carry only the corporate name and logo without the addition
    of “Ltd.” or “Inc.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An unqualified signature on corporate letterhead might, in
    certain contexts, be one factor capable of supporting an inference of personal
    liability: see <i>Barnett v. Rademaker</i> (2004), 47 B.L.R. (3d) 159 (B.C.S.C.).  However in that case, there were several other significant features in
    the dealings between the parties pointing to personal liability. Moreover, the
    correspondence signed without qualification was the very basis for the
    agreement and included language (“I undertake”) that clearly indicated that
    personal liability was being assumed for certain obligations.  Here, there is nothing in the documents or
    the dealings between the parties that, viewed through the lens of ordinary
    commercial practice, could support personal liability. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On this record, the motion judge was entitled to weigh the
    evidence to the limited extent required to determine whether or not there was a
    triable issue.  I do not agree that she
    erred in finding that there was no triable issue.  In my view, on this record, her conclusion is unassailable on
    appeal. </p>

    judge did not err in her appreciation of the onus of proof or in the limited
    weighing of the evidence that she undertook, I disagree with his analysis of
    the impact that the pleadings have on the motion and would allow the
    appeal.  In my view, the motion judge’s
    analysis does not take into account the position taken and admissions made by
    the personal defendants in their statement of defence and counterclaim.  When these are taken into account, the issue
    as to whether an inference can be drawn that the Tans were personally bound for
    the obligations sued upon remains a genuine issue for trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the outset I will briefly summarize the position taken by
    the Tans in their defence and counterclaim.  The allegations are not made in the alternative and are to the effect
    that:</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;'>1.         in 1994, the Tans entered into an oral
    agreement where, in exchange for the Tans giving up a viable tropical fish
    business and agreeing to concentrate their efforts exclusively on the Canadian
    corporation’s business, SERA Germany promised the Tans that it would give SERA
    Canada the exclusive Canadian rights to SERA products and SERA Germany would
    give financial and other support to SERA Canada;</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;'>2.         in 2000, the Tans entered into a
    similar agreement with SERA Germany with respect to SERA USA’s operations;</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;'>3.         the defendants (consisting of the Tans
    as well as SERA USA and SERA Canada) were entitled to a minimum of three years
    notice of the termination of the agreements;</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;'>4.         the Tans have no personal liability to
    SERA Germany; and</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;'>5.         the defendants (again consisting of the
    Tans personally as well as SERA USA and SERA Canada) were entitled to damages
    against SERA Germany for breach of contract in the amount of $5 million.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree with Sharpe J.A.’s view that the pleadings say
    nothing more than the Tans were involved in negotiating the distribution
    agreements.  The pleadings go
    further.  They are to the effect that
    the Tans were parties to agreements with SERA Germany and that they gave consideration
    consisting of the closing their tropical fish business and an ongoing commitment
    to exclusively devote their efforts to SERA Canada and SERA USA.  In exchange, SERA Germany agreed with them
    that it would give SERA Canada and SERA USA certain exclusive rights and, more
    importantly, SERA Germany would give full financial support to SERA Canada and
    SERA USA.  A counterclaim is advanced by
    all defendants, including the Tans’ in their personal capacity, alleging that
    SERA Germany breached the terms of the oral agreements made with them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fact that the Tans consider themselves to be parties to
    agreements with SERA Germany is consistent with the affidavits they have filed
    on the motion.  In these, the Tans deny
    personal liability and assert that the distribution agreements were between
    SERA Germany and the corporate defendants.  They do not, however, specifically deny being parties to agreements with
    SERA Germany.  In order to deny being
    parties to agreements with SERA Germany, they would have had to amend their
    defence and drop their personal counterclaim.  They did not seek to do so as part of their motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The central issue, therefore, in both the claim and
    counterclaim is the terms of the oral agreements.  On my reading of the pleadings both the appellant and the
    respondents agree that oral agreements were entered into and that the Tans were
    parties to them.  Neither has alleged
    that personal liability of the Tans was discussed or specifically addressed in
    the course of coming to the agreements.  Both, however, have different views of the terms of the oral agreements
    as well as the obligations that flow from the agreements reached.  For example, SERA Germany denies that it
    agreed with the Tans that it would “fully financially support” SERA Canada and
    SERA USA.  The Tans for their part,
    maintain that SERA Germany did promise full financial support to their
    companies, but that it could not reasonably be inferred from the dealings and
    agreements reached that they incurred personal liability in exchange for the
    financial support.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Until the terms of the oral agreements are known, it is difficult
    to determine what inferences can reasonably be drawn from the nature of the
    exchange between the parties and the terms of the agreements reached.  I agree that the documents referred to in
    the materials do not, in and of themselves, demonstrate that the Tans are
    personally liable.  The relevance of
    these is whether they support SERA Germany’s or the Tans’ interpretation of the
    discussions and agreements reached.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    pleadings issue may well not have been argued before the motion judge. This
    would explain why the motion judge made no reference to the pleadings in
    her decision and, does not appear to have considered the impact that the
    pleadings had on the motion. The statement in her reasons that &ldquo;it
    would be unjust if the Tans were not extracted at this stage from this action
    given this paucity of evidence of any personal liability&rdquo; suggests
    that it was not pointed out to her that, even if she allowed the Tans&rsquo; motion,
    the Tans would remain parties to the proceedings as plaintiffs by counterclaim.
    In my view, it would be unfair to finally determine, at this stage of the
    proceeding, that the oral agreements whose terms are disputed and to which
    the Tans appear to be parties cannot be interpreted as rendering them personally
    liable to SERA Germany, but can be interpreted as the Tans suggest so as
  to make SERA Germany liable to them personally for breach of contract.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When all of the evidence is considered in light of the
    admissions and positions taken in the pleadings, the Tans’ motion for summary
    judgment cannot succeed.  It requires
    assessing credibility, weighing evidence and making findings of fact on
    disputed evidence.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sharpe J.A. expressed the view that the consequence of the
    Tans being successful on the motion for summary judgment must be that the Tans
    cannot be parties to the same agreement for purposes of advancing a
    counterclaim.  I agree that removing the
    Tans from the counterclaim would produce a more coherent result.  However, this is not what the motion judge
    did, nor could she have done so on the materials before her.  Had the Tans not counterclaimed and simply
    taken the position in their pleadings and materials filed that they were not
    parties to any agreement with SERA Germany and only acted as representatives of
    the corporations in the negotiation of the agreements, the motion and appeal
    would have had a totally different complexion.  </p>

    I would allow the appeal and set aside the summary judgment with costs fixed
    in the amount agreed to by counsel, namely $7,500 inclusive of disbursements
    and G.S.T. I would also award the appellant costs of the motion to be agreed
  to or, if no agreement is reached, assessed.</p>
