  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CRONK J.A.:</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>1.            Introduction</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result of a police drug investigation, the appellant was
    charged with two counts of trafficking cocaine.  On September 8 and October 8, 2003, an undercover police officer
    purchased crack cocaine from a known dealer.  Surveillance officers observed the supplier of the drugs to be the
    driver of a Honda motor vehicle with a licence plate registered to the
    appellant.  They identified the
    appellant as the driver.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On November 22, 2005, following a trial by judge and jury, the
    appellant was convicted on both trafficking counts and sentenced to two years
    less one day imprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his convictions on four grounds arising
    from the trial judge’s charge to the jury.  He argues that the trial judge erred by: (i) failing to instruct the
    jury that it was required to assess the Crown’s identification evidence on each
    count separately; (ii) providing the jury with an inadequate instruction
    concerning the identification evidence; (iii) failing to provide the jury with
    a correcting instruction regarding Crown counsel’s treatment of exculpatory
    evidence during his closing address to the jury; and (iv) failing to instruct
    the jury that the considerable hearsay evidence adduced at trial could not be
    relied upon for the truth of its contents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree that the jury charge was fatally deficient.  Accordingly, I would allow the appeal and
    direct a new trial.  I reach this
    conclusion for the following reasons.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>2.            Identification Evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only real issue at trial was the identification of the
    driver of the Honda – the supplier of the cocaine.  The defence took the position that the police identification of
    the appellant was mistaken and that the driver of the vehicle was the
    appellant’s brother, Al Brown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown relied on the evidence of three police officers to
    establish that the appellant was the driver of the Honda.  Separate identification evidence was led by
    the Crown in respect of each offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In connection with the September 8, 2003 drug transaction, a
    police officer testified that, while he was a passenger in a police
    surveillance vehicle, he observed the driver of the Honda from a distance of
    five or six feet for several seconds while both the police car and the Honda
    were stopped at a red light.  Shortly
    thereafter, he identified the appellant as the driver of the Honda in a police
    photo line-up.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This was the only identification evidence linking the
    appellant to the September 8 offence.  The police officer’s description of the driver of the Honda, however,
    did not match the appellant’s appearance in all respects.  Nor did it completely match the descriptions
    of the driver of the same Honda on October 8, 2003, as subsequently provided by
    two other police surveillance officers in respect of this second incident.  In addition, the defence maintained at trial
    that the police photo line-up was improper in several respects and, hence, that
    the police officer’s identification of the appellant in the photo line-up was
    unreliable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The identification evidence concerning the October 8, 2003
    drug transaction arguably was stronger.  On that occasion, two police surveillance officers independently
    observed the driver of the same Honda.  At the time of their observations, they identified the driver as the
    appellant from a photograph of the appellant that had been supplied to them
    earlier that day as part of a police briefing package.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The identification by one of the officers was made from a
    distance of about fifty feet and was based on his observations made first with
    the naked eye and then with binoculars.  The other police officer testified that he was able to identify the
    appellant as the driver of the Honda when he was stopped at an intersection and
    saw the Honda drive through the intersection.  Although this occurred after dark, the officer said that the police
    vehicle’s headlights momentarily illuminated the interior of the Honda as it
    travelled through the intersection.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence attacked the Crown’s identification evidence on
    several grounds.  Defence counsel
    emphasized, among other matters: the discrepancies between the descriptions of
    the driver of the Honda provided by the three police officers; the
    discrepancies between the police officers’ descriptions of the driver and the
    appearance of the appellant; what the defence alleged were material defects in
    the police photo line-up; and the various police officers’ limited or impeded
    opportunities to visually observe the driver of the Honda.  The defence also relied on evidence
    establishing that on September 13, 2003, within days of the occurrence of the
    predicate offences, the appellant’s brother had driven a Honda vehicle with a
    licence plate registered to the appellant in the same neighbourhood where the
    police claimed to have observed the appellant on the dates of the offences at
    issue.  Finally, the defence relied on
    the trial testimony of a Crown witness who was directly involved in the sale of
    the drugs to the undercover police officer.  She testified that she recognized the appellant’s brother, but not the
    appellant, as one of her drug suppliers.  It is noteworthy, in this regard, that the appellant and his brother are
    markedly different in size.  The jury
    had the opportunity to compare their appearances because the appellant’s
    brother was present in court during the appellant’s trial.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>3.         Trial Judge’s Jury Charge</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given this identification evidence and the theory of the
    defence at trial, I conclude that the jury charge was flawed in two critical
    respects.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the trial judge failed to instruct the jury that it was
    required to consider the evidence in respect of each trafficking count
    separately, and that it could not use the identification evidence relating to
    one count as evidence supporting identification on the other count.  In <i>R. v. M.(B.)</i> (1998), 130 C.C.C.
    (3d) 353 at para. 41, this court, in quoting the decision of the Supreme Court
    of Canada in <i>R. v. Rarru</i> (1996), 107 C.C.C. (3d) 53, stressed the
    importance of this type of instruction in a case involving a multi-count
    indictment:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Thus, in a case involving multiple counts and
    complainants, and where evidence is led of other uncharged misconduct, Sopinka
    J. identified two essential elements of a charge to the jury.  First, when evidence of one count is not
    admissible as similar fact evidence on the other counts, jurors must be
    instructed to consider each charge separately and not to use evidence relating
    to one count as evidence on any of the other counts.  In this case, the jury charge does not include this essential
    element.  The charge does not clearly
    explain to the jurors that they could not use the evidence of all the counts to
    prove any one count.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>The jury charge here suffers from
    the same non-direction identified in <i>R. v. M.(B.)</i>.  See also <i>R. v. H. (F.J.) </i>(2000), 145
    C.C.C. (3d) 169 (Ont. C.A.) at paras. 13-19.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, in this case, the potential prejudice arising from
    this non-direction was amplified by the trial judge’s repeated instruction to
    the jury that it was to base its decision on consideration of all the evidence
    and the “accumulated” evidence at trial.  Of course, this type of instruction is often necessary and proper.  However, in this case, there was a crucial
    distinction to be made between the identification evidence admissible on one
    count in contrast to the identification evidence admissible on the other.  The trial judge’s instruction, coupled with
    the non-direction that I have described, therefore created a significant danger
    that the jury would not have understood that its task was to give separate
    consideration to the identification evidence relating to each count.  Rather, the jury might improperly conclude
    that it could consider all the identification evidence on each of the counts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This danger was not attenuated by the Crown’s indication to
    the jury that it was open to the jury to return different verdicts on each
    count.  In the end, the jury was
    deprived of necessary guidance on the permissible uses of the Crown’s
    identification evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor do I accept that the failure of defence counsel at trial
    to object to these aspects of the jury charge is determinative of this
    appeal.  Not every defence failure to
    challenge a jury charge at trial will preclude a subsequent challenge on
    appeal: see <i>R. v. Austin</i>, [2006] O.J. No. 4660 (C.A.) at paras. 14 and
    15.  In this case, the requisite
    instruction was not discretionary.  To
    the contrary, in my opinion, it was mandatory.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A second and related flaw in the jury charge concerns the
    instruction given to the jury on the identification evidence.  The trial judge provided the jury with a
    general caution on the frailties of eyewitness identification evidence, which
    substantially conformed to the recommended instruction on this topic set out in
    the Ontario Specimen Jury Instructions for criminal trials.  The appellant submits, however, that the
    trial judge erred by failing to relate this caution to the specific weaknesses
    in the identification evidence asserted by the defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree.  In <i>R. v.
    Baltovich</i> (2004), 191 C.C.C. (3d) 289, this court reviewed the need for a
    direction, in an eyewitness identification case, warning the jury of any
    specific weaknesses in the identification evidence.  <i>Baltovich</i> confirms that, in such cases, the need for the
    jury to exercise caution in approaching the identification evidence must be
    related to the particular facts of the case, that is, the jury’s attention must
    be drawn to the issues regarding the Crown’s identification evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This did not occur here.  While the trial judge summarized much of the evidence relating to each
    count in her charge in a sequential fashion, and outlined the theories of the
    Crown and the defence, to the extent that she mentioned any of the frailties in
    the Crown’s identification evidence, she failed to link these to the dangers of
    relying on eyewitness identification evidence or to her earlier general caution
    regarding such evidence.  Although
    defence counsel objected to this part of the jury charge (indeed, he sought a
    mistrial), the trial judge declined to recharge the jury on this issue.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>4.            Disposition</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the appellant that this was not an overwhelming
    Crown case.  There was circumstantial
    evidence at trial that supported the defence theory that the drugs were
    supplied on the occasions in question, not by the appellant, but by his brother.  In these circumstances, it was essential
    that the jury be guided properly on the approach to be taken concerning the use
    of the Crown’s identification evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In view of the defects in the jury charge described above, the
    verdicts cannot stand.  The Crown, quite
    properly, does not suggest that there is room in this case for the application
    of the proviso.  As the identified
    defects in the jury charge necessitate a new trial, I need not address the
    appellant’s other grounds of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons given, I would allow the appeal and direct a
    new trial.</p>
