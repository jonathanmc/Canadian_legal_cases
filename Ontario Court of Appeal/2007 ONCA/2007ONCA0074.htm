      issue in this case is simply enough stated.  Maple Trust innocently acquired
      its interest in the Property in good faith, for valuable consideration
      and without notice of any fraud.  In those circumstances, is the charge
      against the Property in favour of Maple Trust valid and enforceable as
      against the true owner of the property, despite having been acquired from
      a fraudster?  </span></p>

    Lawrence maintains that only the true owner of land can grant an interest
    in, or charge on, the land and that all transactions arising from fraud are
    void.  On this line of argument, since Wright became the registered owner
    of the Property through fraud, he could not grant an enforceable mortgage
    to Maple Trust, regardless of the fact that the transfer of the Property
    to him was registered.  As Ms. Lawrence, the true owner, did not grant the
    charge in favour of Maple Trust, the charge is not valid.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    position reflects the common law principle that a person could not pass better
    title than he or she had.  Accordingly, if title to an interest in land was
    obtained through fraud, that title could never form the root of a good and
    valid claim to the land.     <b><i></i></b></p>

        immediate indefeasibility theory) </span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Maple
    Trust acknowledges that Ms. Lawrence is the victim of fraud.  However, based
    on the theory of “immediate indefeasibility”, it maintains that its charge
    is valid.  On this theory, the Act - like other land titles systems - creates
    a system of title by registration, not a system of registration of title.  A
    system of title by registration is designed to protect the interests of innocent
    parties who rely on the register.  So, once an instrument is registered,
    it is effective even if procured by fraud.  This view reflects the notion
    that the fundamental purpose of the Act is not to protect “true owners” but
    to protect parties who rely on title, as effected by registration.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
    Maple Trust maintains that a fraudulent transferee who is a registered owner
    can grant a valid mortgage to a mortgagee who is acting in good faith without
    notice of the fraud.  Thus, once the transfer to Wright was registered, the
    transfer was deemed to be effective and, as a bona fide purchaser (encumbrancer)
    who gave value for the charge and acted without notice of the fraud, Maple
    Trust says it was entitled to rely on Wright’s title and its charge is valid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    is, Maple Trust says its charge was immediately indefeasible on registration
    because it took from Wright, the person that the register showed to be the
    registered owner.  Wright’s fraud is irrelevant, insofar as the validity
    of Maple Trust’s charge is concerned.        </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Maple
    Trust relies on this court’s decision in <i>Household Realty</i>.  It argues
    that <i>Household Realty</i> is correctly decided and reflects the only rational
    interpretation of the Act that is consistent with the essential purpose of
    a land titles system for land registration.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Maple
    Trust acknowledges that its view results in some innocent parties being deprived
    of legitimate interests in land but argues that the Act provides for the
    establishment and maintenance of the Land Titles Assurance Fund (the “Fund”)
    as a means for compensating persons whose interests have been wrongfully
    affected.  Ms. Lawrence, it maintains, can attempt to recover her losses
    from the Fund.    </p>

    indefeasibility”.  On this theory, there are three classes of parties:  the
    original owner; the intermediate owner, who is the person who dealt with
    the party responsible for the fraud; and, the deferred owner, a bona fide
    purchaser or encumbrancer for value without notice who takes from the intermediate
    owner.  Only a deferred owner would defeat the original owner’s title.  This
    is because the intermediate owner, as the party who acquired an interest
    in title from the fraudster, had an opportunity to investigate the transaction
    and avoid the fraud whereas the deferred owner did not.  On the theory of
    deferred indefeasibility, registration of a void instrument does not cure
    its defect, thus neither the instrument nor its registration gives good title.  However,
    good title can be obtained by a deferred owner from an intermediate owner.</span></p>

    Ontario makes a second argument against the validity of the Maple Trust charge.  This
    argument is based on the following chain of reasoning.  When a document is
    tendered for receipt, date-stamped and numbered, pursuant to s. 78(2) of
    the Act, the Registrar has a period of 21 days to object.  If no objection
    is made, registration of the instrument is complete and, pursuant to s. 78(3),
    the time of registration reverts back to the date of receipt.  However, s. <span lang=EN-US>78(3)
    does not give retroactive effect to events that occurred in the period between
    the time of receipt of the instrument and the completion of registration.  </span>Maple
    Trust advanced money immediately after the transfer was received for registration.  As
    the 21-day period had not expired at the time that it advanced funds and
    s. 78(3) does not give retroactive effect to events occurring within the
    21-day period, Maple Trust is not entitled to rely on s. 78(4) to claim a
    valid interest.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[40]  The land titles system was established in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario in 1885, and was modeled on the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    English
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    <i>Land</i><i> Transfer Act</i> of 1875. It is currently known as the <i>Land
    Titles Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.5. Most Canadian provinces have similar
    legislation.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[41]  The essential purpose of land titles legislation
    is to provide the public with security of title and facility of transfer:
    Di Castri, <i>Registration of Title to Land</i>, vol. 2 looseleaf (Toronto:
    Carswell, 1987) at p. 17-32. The notion of title registration establishes
    title by setting up a register and guaranteeing that a person named as the
    owner has perfect title, subject only to registered encumbrances and enumerated
    statutory exceptions.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[42]  The philosophy of a land titles system embodies
    three principles, namely, the mirror principle, where the register is a perfect
    mirror of the state of title; the curtain principle, which holds that a purchaser
    need not investigate the history of past dealings with the land, or search
    behind the title as depicted on the register; and the insurance principle,
    where the state guarantees the accuracy of the register and compensates any
    person who suffers loss as the result of an inaccuracy. These principles
    form the doctrine of indefeasibility of title and [are] the essence of the
    land titles system. …</p>

      challenge is to interpret s. 155 in light of the clause.  What does it
      mean that a registered charge remains fraudulent and void “subject to the
      provisions of this Act”?  In particular, how is s. 155 to be interpreted

      notice.  It registered its charge.  The fact of registration enables Maple
      Trust to pass a valid title to a third party, so long as the third party
      is also a bona fide purchaser for value without notice.  This third party
      (i.e. the deferred owner) relies on both ss. 68(1) and 78(4).  Unlike Wright,
      Maple Trust did not take by way of fraud so it is a registered owner for
      the purposes of s. 68(1).  And, the deferred owner is, therefore, entitled

    her seminal article, “Indefeasibility of Title in the Canadian Context” (1976),
    26 U.T.L.J. 173, Professor Marcia Neave explains that while the land titles
    legislation in other Canadian provinces followed the Australian true Torrens
    model, the Ontario Act was modeled on English legislation.  She foreshadowed
    the difficulties that the courts would face in grappling with the notion
    of indefeasibility, saying at page 174:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>One of the more difficult decisions facing courts
    interpreting
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Torrens legislation has been the choice between the opposing theories of
    immediate and deferred indefeasibility of title.  Proponents of immediate
    indefeasibility take the view that an innocent purchaser of land, who registers
    an instrument which is void through forgery or breach of some statutory or
    common law requirement, should attain an indefeasible title by registration.  It
    is argued that the policy of a system of title registration is to protect
    a person who registers without fraud.  The fact that the instrument registered
    was void before registration is regarded as irrelevant.  On the other hand,
    proponents of deferred indefeasibility argue that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Torrens legislation was not intended to override the fundamental common law
    rules governing void instruments.  The registration of a void instrument
    cannot cure its defect.  Nevertheless the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Torrens system ensures that the void instrument, when registered, can form
    the root of a good title.  A person who registers an instrument executed
    by the innocent registered proprietor attains indefeasibility on the registration
    of his own dealing.  Thus indefeasibility is ‘deferred’ to the second purchaser.

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>We face here another instance of a temptation to

    of unregistered interests was not expressly excluded as a qualifying consideration,
    the integrity of the land titles register is shaken by the judgment in appeal,

    Ontario, only a few years after the enactment of the <i>Land Titles Act</i>,
    the courts have expressed a disinclination to imply such an extinction of

    all contractual relations and particularly the law of real property has been
    firmly based in our law since the beginning of equity.  It was the view of
    those courts, and it is my view, that such a cardinal principle of property

      interests in land are subject to the doctrine of actual notice.  The notion
      of “absolute” title – that is, immediate indefeasibility - cannot be reconciled
      with the result or the reasoning of the majority.  The theory of immediate
      indefeasibility would have led, as Laskin C.J.C. wrote, to United Trust
      taking title to the property free of Dominion’s claim because, when United
      Trust took title, the register did not reflect Dominion’s interest and
      fraud was not involved.       </span></p>

      both the result and the reasoning of the majority.  United Trust took its
      title from the registered owner.  There is no suggestion of fraud on the
      part of United Trust.  Nonetheless, the majority held that United Trust’s
      title was subject to Dominion’s unregistered lease. The majority recognizes
      that the Act creates a land titles system but rejects the notion of immediate
      indefeasibility.  Thus, although not couched in those terms, it appears
      that the majority subscribes to the theory of deferred indefeasibility,
      a theory which permits the common law to remain a part of the law of
    <st1:State

      indefeasibility is consistent with s. 155, a statutory enshrinement of
      the common law albeit “subject to the provisions of [the] Act”.  As previously
      explained, it is consistent also with an interpretation of s. 68(1) that
      recognizes the common law principle that a fraudster can never take good
      title so as to become the owner but also enables Maple Trust to be recognized
      as the registered owner for the purposes of the deferred owner.  As Maple
      Trust registered its charge and its charge was not obtained by fraud, a
      bona fide purchaser for value without notice (i.e. a deferred owner) could
      rely on a combination of ss. 68(1) and 78(4) to take an indefeasible interest

      and most importantly, in my view, deferred indefeasibility is also preferable
      for policy reasons.  Under the theory of immediate indefeasibility, the
      innocent homeowner has no defence to a mortgagee’s action for possession.  The
      homeowner is exposed to the loss of her home through eviction with the
      only available remedy being to make a claim for loss of value of the property
      from the Fund.  The idea that a person who buys a specific parcel of land
      with a specific house on it should be compensated in damages runs contrary
      to the notion that real property, in such circumstances, is not fungible.  To
      see a lender compensated in damages does not offend that same notion.        </span></p>

      the fraud.  Ms. Lawrence had no ability to discover that her home was being
      fraudulently sold and mortgaged.  By contrast, Maple Trust made the decision
      to advance money and had the opportunity to avoid the fraud.  By interpreting
      the Act in accordance with the theory of deferred indefeasibility, the
      law encourages lenders to be vigilant when making mortgages and places
      the burden of the fraud on the party that has the opportunity to avoid
      it, rather than the innocent homeowner who played no role in the perpetration

      theory of deferred indefeasibility accords with the Act and must be taken
      into consideration in an analysis of s. 155 and its relationship with other
      provisions in the Act.  Under this theory, the party acquiring an interest
      in land from the party responsible for the fraud (the
    “intermediate owner”) is vulnerable to a claim from the true owner because
    the intermediate owner had an opportunity to avoid the fraud.  However, any
    subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer (the “deferred owner”) has no such opportunity.  Therefore,
    in accord with s. 78(4) and the theory of deferred indefeasibility, the deferred
    owner acquires an interest in the property that is good as against all the
    world.  </span></p>

      Trust is the intermediate owner of an interest in the Property.  It had
      an opportunity to avoid the fraud.   It did not take from a registered
      owner.  Therefore, despite registering its charge, Maple Trust loses in
      a contest with the true registered owner, Ms. Lawrence.  Accordingly, the

    Ontario’s alternative argument, summarized earlier when setting out its position,
    that Maple Trust could not rely on s. 78(4) to claim that its charge was

      proposition would turn modern-day conveyancing on its head, given the current
      practice of closing purchases and mortgages on the same day.  Were it necessary

      would be unable to turn to the Fund for compensation.  This, it was said,
      arises from the precondition for recovery under the Act that an applicant
      must actually receive an interest in the land and then lose it.  It was
      suggested that the theory of deferred indefeasibility leads to the conclusion

      never lost it.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span

      my view, the theory of deferred indefeasibility as reflected in the Act,
      does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that Maple Trust never acquired
      an interest in the Property.  It is at least arguable that it did acquire
      such an interest.  However, the interest that it acquired was subject to
      defeat by the true registered owner of the Property, for the reasons already
      given.  The existence of an interest, albeit one that is defeasible in
      very limited circumstances, is demonstrated by the fact that if a bona
      fide third party took from Maple Trust, for value and without notice (i.e.
      a deferred owner), its interest would be indefeasible.  Even in an action
      between the deferred owner and the true owner, the deferred owner would
      win.  If Maple Trust had no interest in the Property, what did it convey
      to the deferred owner and why would the deferred owner succeed?  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It
      is correct that at common law, Maple Trust had no interest in the Property.  That
      is because Maple Trust acquired its interest from Wright and Wright never
      had good title as he procured title by fraud. At common law, Wright could
      convey no better title than he had.  It is also correct that s. 155 provides
      that Maple Trust’s charge, which would have been void if unregistered,
      remains void despite registration.  However, that result is expressly made “Subject
      to the provisions of this Act”.  As previously explained, the provisions
      of the Act made Maple Trust a registered owner and enabled a deferred owner
      to take good title from it.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Arguably,
      once s. 155 is understood in accordance with the theory of deferred indefeasibility,
      it has the effect of transforming what would have been a void interest
      on the part of Maple Trust at common law into a valid interest that was
      defeasible by the true owner.  This view is consonant with the conclusion
      that, as an intermediate owner, Maple Trust’s interest in the Property
      had to yield to the rights of the true owner but that, because of registration
      of its charge, a deferred owner could rely on Maple Trust’s charge to obtain

    this interpretation of ss. 68(1), 78(4) and 155 may appear strained, I note
    Professor Sullivan’s remarks in <i>Sullivan and Driedger on the Construction
    of Statutes</i>, 4th ed. (Markham: Butterworths Canada Ltd., 2002) at 127-28:</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>The jurisdiction to adopt a strained interpretation
    in order to promote the purpose of legislation or avoid absurdity is well
    established and frequently exercised.</p>

    example, this <span lang=EN-US>interpretation would have the effect of rendering
    meaningless the introductory clause in s. 155.</span></p>

    explains that this trend was reversed in Australia and New Zealand by the
    decision in <i>Frazer v. Walker and Radomski, </i>[1967] 1 A.C. 569, but
    notes that the Act, unlike land titles legislation in other Canadian provinces,
    does not closely resemble the legislation in Australia and New Zealand.  She
    also notes, at page 182, that Canadian authority may preclude this as case
    law  “uniformly supports the concept of deferred indefeasibility”.</p>

    rule excluding legislative history as an aid in statutory interpretation
    has been relaxed over the years.  Legislative history may now be admitted
    as relevant to both the background and purpose of the legislation: see <i>Rizzo &amp; Rizzo
    Shoes Ltd. (Re), </i>[1998] 1 S.C.R. 27.</p>
