    2003, pursuant to s. 15 of the <i>Extradition
    Act</i>, S.C. 1999, c. 18 (the “Act”), the Minister of Justice authorized the
    Attorney General of Canada to seek the applicant’s committal for extradition.  The authority to proceed identified six
    Canadian offences.  After a hearing, on
    May 1, 2003, Chapnik J. committed the applicant into custody on three of those
    offences and discharged him on the other three.  The applicant appealed his committal to this court.</p>

    2003, the then Minister of Justice, the Honourable Martin Cauchon, ordered that
    the applicant be surrendered for the conduct in respect of which he had been
    committed.  The Minister’s order referred
    to the charges in the foreign charging document.  The applicant sought judicial review of the Minister’s
    decision.    </p>

    extradition judge and the judicial review of the Minister’s decision
    together.  In <i>United States of America v. Saad</i> (2004), 183 C.C.C. (3d) 97, it
    ordered that the applicant be discharged with respect to one additional charge
    relating to trafficking in ecstasy.  The
    court did not interfere with the committal on the two other charges in the authority
    to proceed, which are:</p>

  <p align=left style='text-align:left'>As a necessary
    consequence of the decision on committal, the court set aside the Minister’s
    surrender order and referred the matter back to the Minister for
    redetermination.  The applicant’s

    Canada was dismissed.</p>

    the surrender order.  He wrote to the
    applicant’s counsel on October 26, 2005, stating that the applicant would be
    surrendered “only for the conduct for which committal was upheld by the Court
    of Appeal”.  In his letter, he referred to
    the foreign charges on which the surrender was based as follows:</p>

    applicant argues that the Minister exceeded his jurisdiction in ordering
    surrender for four specific transactions (three cocaine counts and one count of
    lewd and lascivious battery) because they were not supported by the evidence at
    the committal hearing.  The applicant
    submits that there is a potential misalignment between the factual basis for
    the committals on the two specified Canadian charges and the four factual
    transactions that are the subject of the Minister’s order.</span></p>

    it.  </span></p>

    para. 45 of this court’s decision in <i>Saad</i>, <i>supra</i>, Rosenberg J.A. said:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>It would seem to me that, leaving
    aside specific extradition arrangements in s. 59, if the Minister ordered the
    surrender of a person for an offence that did not come within the conduct
    described in the committal order, he would have acted without
    jurisdiction.  However, the onus is on
    the applicant for judicial review to show that the Minister acted without
    jurisdiction.  The appellant in this case
    has not met that burden. Although he could have done so, the appellant has made
    no effort to obtain the foreign charging documents, nor to provide any
    information to cast doubt on the Minister’s decision.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was no reason why the applicant could not have

    application.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, I do not accept the applicant’s
    jurisdictional argument on its merits. The difference between the evidence led
    at the committal hearing and the four transactions in the Minister’s surrender
    order is, at best, minimal and does not meet the test upon which this court
    should interfere with the Minister’s decision to surrender the applicant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once a person has been committed to await surrender,
    the Minister has a discretion whether to surrender the person or not.  The Minister’s authority to order the person’s
    surrender is found in s. 40(1) of the Act.  The language of the section is permissive.<span

name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>40.(1)  The Minister <u>may</u>, within a period of
    90 days after the date of a person’s committal to await surrender, personally
    order that the person be surrendered to the extradition partner.<span

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Minister’s discretion, however, is not
    unlimited.  Under the heading “Reasons
    for Refusal”, the Act sets out a number of directions to guide the Minister’s
    decision, some mandatory, others discretionary.  The only one relevant to this application is s. 44(1)(a), which
    provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>44.(1)  The Minister shall refuse to make a surrender
    order if the Minister is satisfied that</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(a)  the surrender would be unjust or oppressive
    having regard to all the relevant circumstances; …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the Act provides that the Minister’s decision to
    surrender a person is subject to judicial review.  Section 57 establishes that a person ordered
    to be surrendered may apply to the court of appeal of the province in which the
    committal was ordered to have the Minister’s decision reviewed.  Section 57(7) establishes that a court of appeal
    may grant relief on any of the grounds on which the Federal Court may grant
    relief under subsection 18.1(4) of the <i>Federal
    Courts Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the <i>United
    States of America v. Whitley</i> (1994), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 99 at 110 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), aff’d (1996),
    104 C.C.C. (3d) 447 (S.C.C.), this court formulated the test on a judicial
    review application.  The court pointed
    out that the scope for judicial review is limited and said the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[I]f the Minister
    violates the fugitive’s constitutional rights or otherwise errs in law, or if
    the Minister denies the fugitive procedural fairness, acts arbitrarily, in bad
    faith or for improper motives, or if the Minister’s decision is plainly
    unreasonable, then the reviewing court is entitled to interfere; otherwise, the
    court should defer to the Minister’s surrender decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once the Minister has decided to order a person’s surrender,
    he must comply with s. 58 of the Act, which sets out the requirements for what
    must be included in the surrender order.  Paragraph (b) directs that the Minister describe one of three things:
    the offence in respect of which the extradition is requested; the offence for
    which the committal was ordered; or the conduct for which the person is to be
    surrendered.  The Act, however, does not specifically
    require that the offences or conduct described in the Minister’s order be
    aligned with the evidence on which the committal order was based.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said, there are two possible bases upon which a court
    may grant relief against a decision to surrender based on a misalignment
    between the Minister’s decision and the evidence at the committal hearing.  If it is shown on the application for judicial
    review that the Minister’s decision is unjust or oppressive having regard to
    all the relevant circumstances (s. 44(1)(a) of the Act) or that the decision is
    plainly unreasonable (<i>Whitley</i>, <i>supra</i>), then a reviewing court would be
    entitled to interfere.  Otherwise, the
    Minister has a broad discretion as to what offences or conduct he includes in
    an order to surrender a person to a requesting state.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support of his misalignment argument, the applicant
    relies upon <i>United States of
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">America</st1:country-region>
    v. Reumayr</i> (2003), 176 C.C.C. (3d)
    377 (B.C.C.A.).  There the court found a
    surrender order to be deficient on the basis that the Act does not authorize
    surrender for offences that substantively exceed the offences that are
    supported by the committal proceedings.  At para. 42, the court said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It would defeat
    the purpose of the committal hearing if the Minister’s discretion extended to
    surrender for offences <u>substantively beyond</u> those supported by evidence
    at the committal hearing.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are two points about <i>Reumayr</i> that should be emphasized.  First, the court pointed out that the Minister need not be concerned
    about matters of form when reviewing a decision to surrender.  It is not necessary that the equivalent
    Canadian offence have the same name or even the same elements as the foreign
    offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the court spoke of the Minister’s discretion
    being restricted only to surrendering for offences not “substantively beyond”
    those supported by the evidence.  By that
    I take the court to mean that the Minister and a reviewing court should not be
    concerned with differences in details or particulars.  As Goudge J.A. points out at para. 64 of <i>The Minister of Justice v. Gorcyca</i>, a
    judgment being released simultaneously with this one, “[o]nly where there is an
    absence of evidence on what would appear to be an essential element of the
    foreign charge in the surrender order could it be argued that the order is
    plainly unreasonable or unjust or oppressive, at least without an explanation
    of why it is not.”   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning now to the facts in this case, the applicant
    asserts that the evidence disclosed only two possible cocaine transactions – in
    contrast with the three transactions referred to in the surrender order.  That is wrong.  The record of the case (the evidence at the
    committal hearing) set out three distinct cocaine transactions, on February 9,
    23 and 25, 2002.  The fact that the
    foreign indictment which is incorporated into the surrender order places the
    second transaction on February 24, rather than February 23, is a minor detail
    and an issue for the foreign trial court.  Moreover, the applicant’s argument that there is a potential that the
    committal was based on evidence of transactions other than those reflected in
    the surrender order is unfounded.  Clearly, there is a sufficient nexus between the two.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the applicant’s misalignment argument falls
    well short of establishing that the Minister’s surrender order was either “unjust
    or oppressive” or “plainly unreasonable”. </p>

    that it was not necessary to decide the constitutionality of “trafficking by

    transporting and/or by distributing.  </span></p>

    there is no question that trafficking by these other means falls within the
    established definition of trafficking, the conduct that underlies the committal

    Canadian constitutional requirements.  </span></p>

    do not agree with the applicant that the Minister relied upon irrelevant facts.  It was open to the Minister to consider that
    if the applicant was not surrendered,
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    would be denying its
    extradition partner’s legitimate treaty request.  In that context, it was fair for the Minister
    to comment that
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    should not be or be seen to be a safe haven from foreign prosecutions.  The applicant was a resident in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida at the time of
    the alleged offences. 
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Florida has a legitimate interest in
    ensuring that the applicant be brought to justice for a proper determination of
    his guilt or innocence.  It was relevant
    for the Minister to consider that if he denied surrender, the applicant would
    escape prosecution for those offences.  </span></p>

    I see no error in the Minister referring to the maximum sentences for the offences
    in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Florida.  In doing so, he made the point that the
    remaining charges on which the applicant was being surrendered (after dropping
    the ecstasy charge) were still very serious and that there would be
    considerable room for the
    <st1:State w:st="on">

    Immigration Canada (“CIC”) (pursuant to s. 40(2) of the Act), Minister Cauchon concluded
    that it was unlikely that the applicant would face any of the dire consequences
    that he argued would occur.  In <i>Saad</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 53, this court declined to interfere with the

    the Minister to have relied on the CIC information in making the surrender
