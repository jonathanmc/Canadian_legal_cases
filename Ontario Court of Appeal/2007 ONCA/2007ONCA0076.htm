    order his surrender in the terms of the foreign charges only if there is a
    precise correspondence between the conduct alleged against him, the order
    committing him, and the foreign charges. These submissions were filed by the
    end of June 2006. In October 2006, Mr. Gorcyca discharged his lawyer and was
    given leave to file further written submissions by November 17, 2006, which he
    did. The court did not require a response from the Minister.</span></p>

    its decision in <i>United States of America v. Ferras</i> (2006), 209 C.C.C. (3d)
    353. As a consequence, counsel sought and received leave to file further
    written submissions on the appeal of the committal order. These submissions
    address what I will call the “<i>Ferras</i>” issue, namely the role of the
    extradition judge in assessing the sufficiency of the evidence presented at the
    committal hearing. The filing of these submissions was completed by October 4,
    2006.</span></p>

      States</st1:country-region>
    , together with the Authority To Proceed
    issued by the Minister, amply describe the allegations faced by the appellant.
    The abuse of process allegation falls far short of demonstrating any compromise
    to the fairness of the committal hearing or any potentially ominous climate
    that might be facing the appellant in the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place

      United States</st1:country-region>
    . The reasons of the
    extradition judge reveal her reasoning process and permit meaningful appellate
    review. Finally, the fact that the committal order signed by the extradition
    judge was prepared by the party seeking it is simply routine.</span></p>

      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
    did not adequately
    indicate the sources of the information provided. I agree with the respondent’s
    response that, on proper examination, this is not so. The
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
    filed the record of the case and two supplementary records. Taken together,
    they adequately set out the sources of the information provided and certify their
    availability for trial. This ground of appeal fails.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant’s “<i>Ferras</i>” argument arises as a result of the decision of the
    Supreme Court of Canada last summer. In that case, the accused argued that the
    provisions of the <i>Extradition Act, </i>S.C.
    1999, c. 18 (the “Act”),  regulating the
    committal hearing do not ensure the threshold reliability of the evidence
    placed before the extradition judge and therefore do not comply with s. 7 of
    the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>. The court dismissed this argument,
    finding that s. 29(1) of the Act gives the extradition judge the obligation to
    determine that the evidence is reliable enough to justify committal. The court
    was clear that this entitles the extradition judge to weigh the evidence to a
    limited extent, and further, that this represented a change in the previous
    jurisprudence which had left the extradition judge little or no room to
    evaluate the evidence from the foreign state. The court put it this way, at
    para. 46 of <i>Ferras, supra</i>:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Section
    29(1)’s direction to an extradition judge to determine whether there is
    admissible evidence that would “justify committal” requires a judge to assess
    whether admissible evidence <i>shows the justice or rightness</i> in committing
    a person for extradition. It is not enough for evidence to merely exist on each
    element of the crime. The evidence must be demonstrably able to be used by a
    reasonable, properly instructed jury to reach a verdict of guilty. If the
    evidence is incapable of demonstrating this sufficiency for committal, then it
    cannot “justify committal”. The evidence need not convince an extradition judge
    that a person sought is guilty of the alleged crimes. That assessment remains
    for the trial court in the foreign state. However, it must establish a case
    that <i>could go to trial</i> in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    . This may require the
    extradition judge to engage in limited weighing of the evidence to determine,
    not ultimate guilt, but sufficiency of evidence for committal to trial.

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    this case, the extradition judge understandably took her cue from the previous
    jurisprudence. In her reasons for judgment, she described her task as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    person sought can point out weaknesses or deficiencies in the evidence of the

    State and present argument as to why he
    should not be extradited. However, the extradition judge is not required to
    weigh the evidence or to decide issues of credibility.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While

      United States</st1:country-region>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant’s position on this question turns on two pieces of evidence he
    adduced before the extradition judge. The appellant argues that had she engaged
    in even a limited weighing of that evidence against the evidence adduced on
    behalf of the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">

    the latter would have been found insufficiently reliable to warrant his

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    case against the appellant is that the fraudulent communications with which he
    is charged emanated from a condominium in

    North
    Miami Beach,

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    first piece of evidence the appellant relies on is the sworn statement of his
    former wife, Magaly Perez, in which she testifies that after the appellant
    moved out of that condo in the fall of 1997 he “did not use” the small office
    there, although he was there on weekends to pick up their daughter. This is
    only slightly different from her expected evidence as described in the record
    of the case tendered by the United States, which is to the effect that he went
    to the condo at least once a week to visit their daughter and do work in the
    home office. This slight difference does not make the latter unreliable as
    evidence of his access to the site from which the fraudulent communications originated.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Taken
    together with substantial other evidence that the appellant sent the fraudulent
    faxes from that condo, a limited weighing of the sworn statement of Ms. Perez
    would not have affected the result reached by the extradition judge.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    second piece of evidence is of even less assistance to the appellant. It is an
    affidavit from C. Elvin Feltner Jr. filed by the appellant at the committal
    hearing, in which Mr. Feltner testifies that he agreed to allow the appellant
    to offer some television airtime he owned to the appellant’s customers, and
    that at all times he was locatable by those seeking to contact him.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    record of the case does not describe Mr. Feltner as a witness but does describe
    the expected evidence of others to the effect that they were unable to contact
    him or get confirmation from him that he had airtime available. In these
    circumstances, the Feltner affidavit does not diminish the reliability of this
    evidence nor does it diminish its sufficiency to justify the appellant’s
    committal. A limited weighing of it by the extradition judge would not have
    changed the result. I would therefore dismiss this ground of appeal.</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that, because of the principle of
    double criminality, the Minister has no jurisdiction to order surrender for
    foreign offences where he is not satisfied that the particular conduct at issue
    in those offences has been determined by the extradition judge to justify
    committal for trial in Canada. The appellant therefore says that the surrender
    order must be quashed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Put another way, the appellant argues that the

      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    for the

    the conduct alleged against him, the offences named in the committal order and
    the foreign charges.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant says that the Minister can easily avoid
    this difficulty by drafting the Canadian offences named in the Authority To
    Proceed in a way that matches the foreign charges.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The background for this argument is the request of the

    committal of the appellant for the offences set out in the Authority To
    Proceed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Minister issued his decision to surrender the appellant
    on November 19, 2004 in the following terms:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Finally, I have decided to order your surrender to
    the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
    on the offences of wire fraud (6 counts) and securities fraud (6 counts). I
    will not order surrender on the conspiracy offence since no Canadian offence
    was listed in the Authority to Proceed that would correspond to the conduct
    alleged in relation to the conspiracy charge and you were not committed for
    extradition on such an offence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The order of surrender of the same date orders the
    surrender of the appellant to the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place

      United States</st1:country-region>
    for “[s]ix counts of

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s argument is not about the principle of
    specialty. The order of surrender leaves no doubt about the offences for which
    he can be prosecuted in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">United
      States</st1:country-region>
    following his extradition. He can only
    be prosecuted for the foreign charges in the order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rather, his argument engages the principle of double
    criminality. He says that for four counts of wire fraud, the evidence
    concerning the fax at issue (and whether he was its sender) was not analyzed by
    the extradition judge, and thus was not determined by the extradition judge to justify
    his committal in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For two counts of securities fraud, the appellant says
    that there was no evidence before the extradition judge of conduct in relation
    to the securities of the two companies concerned. He says that the extradition
    judge could not have committed him on these two delicts and did not purport to
    do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that, as a consequence, the
    Minister had no jurisdiction to surrender him for trial in the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    on these six offences. He says that the misalignment between these six foreign
    charges for which he is being surrendered, the charges on which he was
    committed, and the conduct alleged against him offends the requirements of
    Canadian extradition law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The broad context for the analysis of this issue has
    been provided by the Supreme Court of Canada. For nearly two decades that court
    has made clear that a rigidly technical approach to extradition proceedings
    should be rejected in favour of a fair and liberal interpretation that seeks to
    fulfill
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ’s
    international obligations. In <i>Schmidt v.
    The Queen et al. </i>(1987), 33 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at 215-16 (S.C.C.), the court
    put it this way:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The present system of extradition works because
    courts give the treaties a fair and liberal interpretation with a view to fulfilling
    Canada’s obligations, reducing the technicalities of criminal law to a minimum
    and trusting the courts in the foreign country to give the fugitive a fair
    trial, including such matters as giving proper weight to the evidence and
    adequate consideration of available defences and the dictates of due process
    generally. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before turning to the alleged misalignment between the
    various steps in the extradition process, the first task is to analyze whether
    each of those steps, taken separately, complies with the Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first step is the issuing of the Authority To
    Proceed by the Minister. Section 15(3) of the Act sets out its mandatory
    contents:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>15. (3)            The
    authority to proceed must contain</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;

    description of the person whose extradition is sought;</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>the name of the
    extradition partner; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>the name of the
    offence or offences under Canadian law that correspond to the alleged conduct
    of the person or the conduct in respect of which the person was convicted, as
    long as one of the offences would be punishable in accordance with paragraph
    3(1)(b).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Authority To Proceed in this case complies with
    these mandatory requirements. The offences named in the Authority To Proceed
    need not specify particulars of the transactions alleged against the appellant,
    at least apart from considerations of due process. Moreover, the offences named
    in the Authority To Proceed may be fewer in number than those in the foreign
    charging document, provided that the former are broad enough to embrace the
    counts in the latter. See <i>United States
    of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      America</st1:country-region>

    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).
    In other words, there is no need for the offences named in the Authority To
    Proceed to precisely mirror the offences in the foreign charging document.
    Section 15(3) requires that the named Canadian offences correspond to the
    alleged conduct of the person sought, not to the foreign offences. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second step is the committal hearing and the
    resulting committal order issued by the extradition judge. For someone sought
    for prosecution, that step is governed by ss. 29(1)(a) and (2) of the Act:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            29.
    (1)  A judge shall order the committal of
    the person into custody to await surrender if</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a)       in the case of a person sought for
    prosecution, there is evidence admissible under this Act of conduct that, had
    it occurred in Canada, would justify committal for trial in Canada on the
    offence set out in the authority to proceed and the judge is satisfied that the
    person is the person sought by the extradition partner; …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)       The
    order of committal must contain</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a)       the
    name of the person;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b)       the offence set out in the authority to
    proceed for which the committal is ordered;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(c)       the place at which the person is to be
    held in custody; and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(d)       the
    name of the extradition partner.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, these requirements were also complied
    with. The extradition judge found that there was admissible evidence of conduct
    that, had it occurred in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ,
    would justify committal for trial in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    on the offences set out in
    the Authority To Proceed. In performing this limited task the extradition judge
    is not required to consider the foreign charging document or foreign law. See <i>Saad</i>, <i>supra</i>,<i> </i>at para. 23. In
    other words, at the committal stage there is no requirement to ensure that the
    alleged conduct supports the foreign charges.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third step is the surrender order issued by the
    Minister. Section 58 of the Act sets out its requirements. Sections 58(a) and
    (b) read as follows:</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>contain the name of
    the person who is to be surrendered;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>describe the offence
    in respect of which the extradition is requested, the offence for which the
    committal was ordered or the conduct for which the person is to be surrendered;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here the Minister met these requirements by ordering
    the appellant’s surrender for the offences in respect of which extradition was
    requested, namely the offences in the foreign charging document. Thus this
    step, viewed on its own, also satisfied the Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the appellant argues that the Minister can
    only issue a surrender order in the terms of the foreign offences if he can be
    assured that the appellant’s alleged conduct that would support those offences
    has been found by the extradition judge to warrant committal in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    . In
    other words, the alleged conduct, the offences named in the Authority To
    Proceed and the committal order, and the foreign offences described in the
    surrender order cannot be misaligned.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view this is not required by the Act, the <i>Treaty on Extradition between the Government
    of Canada and the Government of the United States of America</i>, 3 December
    1971, Can. T.S. 1976, No. 3, as am. by Can. T.S. 1991/37 (the “Treaty”), or the
    principle of double criminality. What is required is that the alleged conduct
    of the person sought, had it occurred in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , would warrant committal for
    an offence named in the Authority To Proceed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This principle is reflected in ss. 3(1)(b) and (2) of
    the Act:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            3.(1)    A person may be extradited from Canada in
    accordance with this Act and a relevant extradition agreement on the request of
    an extradition partner for the purpose of prosecuting the person or imposing a
    sentence on – or enforcing a sentence imposed on – the person if</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>…</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b)       the conduct of the person, had it
    occurred in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , would
    have constituted an offence that is punishable in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ,</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)       For
    greater certainty, it is not relevant whether the conduct referred to in
    subsection (1) is named, defined or characterized by the extradition partner in
    the same way as it is in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These provisions are clearly conduct-based. They
    require that the alleged conduct, if it had occurred here, constitute <u>an</u> offence in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    ,
    not <u>the precise</u> offence mirroring the offences in the foreign charging
    document.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Treaty reflects the same approach. The basic
    principle is that extradition requires that the alleged conduct constitute an
    offence in both countries, not that it constitutes precisely the same offence. Article
    2(1) puts it this way: </p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText align=center style='text-align:center;
'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Article 2</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)       Extradition shall be granted for conduct
    which constitutes an offense punishable by the laws of both Contracting Parties
    by imprisonment or other form of detention for a term exceeding one year or any
    greater punishment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The other article in the Treaty that is relevant to
    this issue is Article 10(1):</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Article
    10</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)       Extradition shall be granted only if the
    evidence be found sufficient according to the laws of the place where the
    person sought shall be found either to justify his committal for trial if the
    offense of which he is accused had been committed in its territory or to prove
    that he is the identical person convicted by the courts of the requesting
    State.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While less clear, this provision, read consistently
    with Article 2(1), requires only that the evidence said to constitute the
    foreign offence be sufficient to justify committal for trial in the country
    where the requested person is found in order for the extradition to be granted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus the Treaty mirrors the Act: extradition requires
    that the conduct alleged by the foreign state to be criminal also constitute an
    offence in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .
    The precise alignment of the alleged conduct, the named Canadian offence in the
    committal order, and the foreign offence is not necessary. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the principle of double criminality does not
    support the appellant’s argument either. In <i>United
    States of America v. McVey</i> (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 7 (S.C.C.), LaForest
    J., writing for the majority, made clear that from the standpoint of domestic
    law, extradition is a creature of statute and that Canada’s international
    obligations must be found in the terms of the appropriate treaty. Thus, while
    this principle may have value as an aid to interpreting the law, it has no
    freestanding effect. By itself, double criminality cannot bring the appellant
    success.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More importantly, the principle of double criminality
    is to the same effect as the Act and the Treaty. It is conduct-based. In an oft-quoted
    passage in <i>United States of America v.
    Manno</i> (1996), 112 C.C.C. (3d) 544 at 552 (Que.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), Proulx J.A. described the
    rules of double criminality and specialty. He described the former this way:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>According to the first rule, a person can only be
    extradited where it has been proven that the act with which he is charged
    constitutes a crime under the respective laws of the two states in question,
    but without it being necessary that this act constitute the same identical
    crime in the two states. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once again, there is no requirement that the alleged
    conduct constitute both a foreign offence and the Canadian offence which is its
    precise counterpart. It is enough to satisfy double criminality if the conduct
    alleged by the foreign state to constitute the foreign offence also constitutes
    a crime in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, I would conclude that neither the Act nor
    the Treaty nor the principle of double criminality require the Minister to
    ensure the precise alignment of the alleged conduct, the Canadian offence in
    the committal order and the foreign offence as the appellant contends. The
    Minister can order surrender in terms of the foreign offence for which
    extradition is sought if the conduct alleged by the foreign state to be
    sufficient for the foreign prosecution has been found both admissible under the
    Act and sufficient, if committed here, to justify committal for a Canadian
    offence that corresponds to that conduct. That is exactly what happened here. The
    appellant’s misalignment argument must be dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even if the misalignment argument were slightly recast
    to suggest that, independent of the committal order, the Minister must require
    some correspondence between the evidence in the foreign record and the foreign
    charges recited in the surrender order, I think it would fail on the facts of
    this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no doubt that the Minister has a discretion to
    order surrender once a person has been committed to await surrender. Section
    40(1) of the Act says this:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>40. (1)  The
    Minister <u>may</u>, within a period of 90 days after the date of a person’s
    committal to await surrender, personally order that the person be surrendered
    to the extradition partner. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the Minister’s discretion is not unlimited. Section
    44(1)(a) of the Act sets out a limit relevant to this argument:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>44.(1) The
    Minister shall refuse to make a surrender order if the Minister is satisfied
    that</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)  the
    surrender would be unjust or oppressive having regard to all the relevant
    circumstances; …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, s. 57 of the Act permits judicial review of
    the Minister’s decision to order surrender. The deference to be accorded by the
    reviewing court is significant, however. In <i>United
    States of America v. Whitley</i> (1994), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 99 at 110 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), aff’d
    (1996), 104 C.C.C. (3d) 447 (S.C.C.), this court formulated the scope for
    judicial review as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[I]f the Minister violates the fugitive’s
    constitutional rights or otherwise errs in law, or if the Minister denies the
    fugitive procedural fairness, acts arbitrarily, in bad faith or for improper
    motives, or if the Minister’s decision is plainly unreasonable, then the
    reviewing court is entitled to interfere; otherwise, the court should defer to
    the Minister’s surrender decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The recast version of this argument raises the question
    of whether there is a misalignment between the evidence in the foreign record
    and the foreign charges sufficient to justify judicial review of the Minister’s
    decision to order surrender in the terms of those charges.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In answering this question, the case of <i>United States of America v. Reumayr</i> (2003), 176 C.C.C. (3d) 377 (B.C.C.A.), is helpful in suggesting that the
    general approach of a reviewing court should not focus on differences in
    details or particulars. That court found that a surrender order would be
    deficient if it ordered surrender in terms of foreign charges that were
    substantively beyond the Canadian offences supported by the evidence at the
    committal hearing. That court put it this way, at para. 42:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It would defeat the purpose of the committal
    hearing if the Minister’s discretion extended to surrender for offences substantively
    beyond those supported by evidence at the committal hearing. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I think this approach is properly applied to a court’s
    review, in light of the evidence in the foreign record, of the Minister’s
    decision to order surrender in the terms of the foreign charges.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where the Minister chooses to do this, the complaint
    that the evidence in the foreign record does not sufficiently support the
    foreign charges can have only very limited reach, in my view. The Minister is
    not charged with evaluating that evidence against the counterpart Canadian
    charges in the Authority To Proceed. Nor is there a requirement that the
    Canadian charges exactly match the foreign charges, as I have attempted to
    explain. Moreover, the Act requires that the foreign state certify that the
    evidence is sufficient to justify prosecution on the foreign charges and the
    principle of international comity requires that this be respected.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This leaves little scope for the recast misalignment
    argument. In my view, only where there is an absence of evidence on what would
    appear to be an essential element of the foreign charge in the surrender order
    could it be argued that the order is plainly unreasonable or unjust or
    oppressive, at least without an explanation of why it is not. In such
    circumstances it could well be plainly unreasonable to deport someone where,
    from
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    ’s
    perspective, there would seem to be no possibility of a just conviction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the only counts in the surrender order
    that are germane to this argument are the two counts of securities fraud for
    which the appellant says there was no evidence in the foreign record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree with this assertion. There was clear
    evidence of correspondence emanating from the appellant that fraudulently promoted
    the shares of the two companies named in those two counts. Added to the
    appellant’s pattern of conduct described in detail in that record it cannot be
    said that there is an absence of evidence of an apparently essential element of
    these two foreign charges.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, even as reframed, I think the misalignment
    argument must fail. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would therefore dismiss the application for judicial
    review.</p>
