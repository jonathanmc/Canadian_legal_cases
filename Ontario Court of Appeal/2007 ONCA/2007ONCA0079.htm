    of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194.  The motions judge granted both motions and dismissed the claims against
    all the respondents with costs.  Pasquale Mammoliti and Andrew Ferri both appeal.  Their appeals were heard together.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ferri, through a company he owned, entered into an agreement
    with the Toronto-Dominion Bank (the “TD Bank”) to purchase a building in
    Welland, Ontario.  Thereafter, he
    retained Mammoliti to assist him in the clean up of the purchased property,
    which was carried out prior to closing.  As a result of this clean up, events occurred that gave rise to both
    Ferri and Mammoliti being charged by the NRPD with the criminal offences of
    extortion and theft. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsequent events resulted in all charges against Ferri and
    Mammoliti being dismissed or withdrawn.  Each of them then commenced independent civil actions against the NRPD,
    the Crown Attorneys, and the TD Bank<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a> seeking damages for malicious prosecution, false arrest, false imprisonment,
    negligence and breaches of the <i>Canadian
    Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motions judge, in my view, erred when he dismissed the
    claims of Mammoliti and Ferri against the NRPD and the Crown Attorneys for
    malicious prosecution, negligence, and breaches of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  In all other respects the motion judge correctly dismissed their
    claims.  Consequently, for the reasons
    set out below, I would allow portions of the appeals of both Mammoliti and
    Ferri. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND </span></h4>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

    is the President of Universal Management Consultants Inc.  On March 12, 1997, on behalf of his company,
    he proposed an Agreement of Purchase and Sale with the TD Bank to purchase
    55-57 East Main Street, in Welland, Ontario.  The Agreement of Purchase and Sale contained the following clause: “The
    Vendor agrees to remove all bank records and files stored in the building prior
    to closing”. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>This
    clause was subsequently crossed out by the TD Bank and the following clause was
    inserted: “The Purchaser accepts the building in an ‘as-is’ condition”.  The transaction was scheduled to close on
    May 30, 1997.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>There
    appears to be some disagreement about whether the transaction actually closed
    on Friday, May 30, 1997 or on Monday, June 2.  Whichever it is, it is of no legal significance to this appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sometime in April 1997, <span lang=EN-GB>Ferri retained the services of Mammoliti to
    enter the building and remove approximately 2,000 banker boxes that had been
    left there by the TD Bank.  Mammoliti
    removed the boxes one to two weeks later, over the course of two to three
    visits to the premises. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On May
    13, 1997, the TD Bank became aware that bank files had been taken out of the
    building by Ferri in advance of the closing date.  Contact was then made by the bank to Ferri in connection with the
    bank files.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On or
    about May 15, 1997, the TD Bank and Ferri discussed the return of the files in
    exchange for compensation to Ferri for his labour and storage costs in an
    amount around $500 and a release from the TD Bank protecting him from lawsuits
    or damages.  The TD Bank agreed in
    principle to Ferri’s request, and completed the real estate transaction on June
    2, 1997 notwithstanding that compensation and a release were not complete, and
    that the bank files had not yet been returned. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Until
    June 6, 1997, Ferri and the TD Bank, through their respective lawyers, continued
    to negotiate the issues of compensation and release for the bank files.  However, on June 6, 1997, Ferri’s lawyer
    advised the TD Bank that they should now deal directly with Mammoliti, who had
    possession of the bank files. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The TD
    Bank then contacted Mammoliti and requested the return of its files.  Conversation ensued about how much the bank
    would pay for the return of the files, resulting in Mammoliti asking for
    $500,000.  Following this phone
    conversation, the TD Bank contacted the Niagara Regional Police Service. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>From
    June 11 through June 16, 1997, conversation occurred between Mammoliti or his
    lawyer, representatives of the TD Bank and the Niagara Regional Police
    regarding the bank files.  Mammoliti’s
    lawyer informed the bank that Mammoliti was treating the situation as an
    abandonment of the files and that the bank should negotiate on this basis.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    June 13, 1997, the TD Bank learned that Mammoliti allegedly told a customer
    that he had read the customer’s file.  Mammoliti’s lawyer advised the TD Bank that Mammoliti was in possession
    of the files and would not return them unless the bank purchased them from
    him.  In response, the TD Bank advised
    that Ferri and Mammoliti would be responsible for any damages the bank suffered
    as a result of the alleged breach of confidentiality.  The TD Bank also spoke with the Fraud Office of the Welland
    Police detachment and subsequently met with them. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>On
    June 19, 1997, the investigation of the TD Bank’s complaint was assigned to the
    respondents, Detective Greg MacDonald and Detective Louann Schenck, of the
    Niagara Regional Police Service.  That
    same day, they met with the branch manager of the TD Bank to discuss the
    matter. </span></p>

    June 23, 1997, the respondent, Crown Attorney Allan Root and </span><span

    agreed that Ferri should be charged with theft and possibly conspiracy, and
    that Mammoliti should be charged with extortion and possession of property
    obtained by crime. </span></p>

    July 3, 1997, during a meeting with Detectives MacDonald and Schenck, Ferri’s

    in January 1998, Crown Attorney Root assigned the matter to the respondent,
    Assistant Crown Attorney Patricia Vaddacchino.  On February 11, 1998, Ferri was charged jointly with Mammoliti with
    attempted extortion and theft over $5,000.  </span><span lang=EN-US>At the time the

    made by the motions judge.  When the

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-GB>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Did

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I will examine the issues in the order set out above.  In my analysis of the first issue, namely
    the effect of the decision of Matheson J., I will also address another matter
    that was raised in oral argument on these appeals.  Specifically, in his reasons the motions judge held that the
    claims by Mammoliti and Ferri were dismissed “against all the defendants named
    in [their actions]”.  This, of course
    conflicts with the decision of Matheson J. who dismissed the TD Bank’s prior
    motion for summary judgment.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>(i)            The decision of Matheson J.</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I noted above, the decision of Matheson J. dealt
    exclusively with the actions of Mammoliti and Ferri against the TD Bank.  The Crown Attorneys and the NRPD subsequently
    brought their own motions for summary judgment, which motions were decided by
    Sheppard J.  The TD Bank was given
    notice of these motions but did not appear.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The order made by Sheppard J. can bind only the Crown
    Attorneys and the NRPD for the same reasons the order made by Matheson J. can
    bind only the TD Bank: Rule 20 permits each defendant to bring his or her own
    independent motion for summary judgment dismissing all or part of the claim
    against him or her and each defendant’s motion is to be decided independently
    and on its own merits.  This is not an
    uncommon practice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the formal order of Sheppard J. – which is the
    subject of this appeal – clearly establishes that only the claims against the
    Crown Attorneys and NRPD are dismissed.  In my view, nothing turns on the overly broad language used by Sheppard
    J.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More importantly, Mammoliti and Ferri argue that the decision
    of Matheson J. renders the matters before Sheppard J. <i>res judicata</i>.  However, as I
    have detailed above, the parties in each motion were different, as were the
    issues and the relevant material facts.  In these circumstances the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> has no application.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the same reasons, there is also no abuse of process.  I would, therefore, dismiss this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>(ii)             Malicious prosecution and the
    remaining claims</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sheppard J. held that the claims of Ferri and Mammoliti –
    except for malicious prosecution - are barred by s. 7(1) of the <i>Public Authorities Protection Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. P.38.  I will deal first
    with the claims for malicious prosecution and then return to the issue of the
    application of the <i>Public Authorities
    Protection Act</i>.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US>(a)             Malicious
    prosecution</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although these appeals are in respect of all the claims
    dismissed by the motions judge, the central issue for consideration – as
    generally accepted by all the parties – is his treatment of the “malicious
    prosecution” claims.  That is, was he
    correct in respect of the law and how he applied it, and were there genuine
    issues of material facts requiring a trial? </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is important to keep in mind throughout these
    reasons that the paramount theory of both Mammoliti and Ferri is that the NRPD
    and Crown Attorneys were improperly using their offices to assist the TD Bank
    in the recovery of its files.  In doing
    so, they assert that the offices and authority of the NRPD and Crown Attorneys
    were used to facilitate criminal proceedings in connection with a matter they
    knew was purely civil. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In considering the claims for malicious prosecution, the
    motions judge correctly approached his examination by separately considering
    the roles played by the NRPD and the Crown Attorneys.  Relying on <i>Nelles v.
    Ontario</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 170 at 192-93 (S.C.C.) he correctly set out the
    four part test that Mammoliti and Ferri were each required to satisfy to
    successfully prove their claims of malicious prosecution against the NRPD and
    the Crown Attorneys, namely:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>1. The impugned prosecution must have been initiated or continued by
    the defendant; </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>2. The proceedings must have terminated in favour of the plaintiff; </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>3. The proceedings must have been instituted without reasonable and
    probable grounds; and, </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>4. The defendant must have acted out of malice or for a primary purpose
    other than that of carrying the law into effect.<a
href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[4]</span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motions judge dismissed Ferri’s claim for malicious
    prosecution against the Crown Attorneys after finding that Ferri failed to
    satisfy the first element of the above test with respect to his claim.  He also dismissed Ferri’s claim against the
    NRPD upon finding that Ferri failed to satisfy the third and fourth
    elements.  Finally, the motions judge
    dismissed Mammoliti’s claim for malicious prosecution against the NRPD after
    concluding that the second, third and fourth elements were not satisfied. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the motions judge erred in respect of each
    of his conclusions.  I propose to
    demonstrate the errors made by the motions judge by examining the four elements
    of <i>Nelles</i> in their order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><i>                        Element
    one (prosecution initiated by the defendant)</i></b><b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted, the only reliance on element one by the
    motions judge was in connection with his dismissal of Ferri’s claim against the
    Crown Attorneys.  <span lang=EN-US>The motions judge found that the Crown
    Attorneys did not initiate the prosecution within the meaning of the <i>Nelles </i>test
    because they had no role in laying the charges against Ferri notwithstanding
    that the NRPD consulted Root for legal advice.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In response to the Ferri motion, the Crown Attorneys
    expressly - and correctly in my view - conceded that the first two elements of
    malicious prosecution had been met.  Paragraph 55 of the factum filed by the Crown Attorneys on the motion
    succinctly sets out their position:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>For purposes of the
    motion, the Crown defendants concede that the first two elements of the tort of
    malicious prosecution are satisfied: the police initiated the proceedings and
    the Assistant Crown Attorney continued the prosecution; and it was terminated
    in favour of the plaintiff.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, with respect to Ferri’s malicious prosecution
    claim against the Crown Attorneys, the motions judge ought to have found that
    elements one and two of the <i>Nelles</i> test had been established.  I would
    therefore allow this ground of appeal.  My conclusion here, however, does not fully answer Ferri’s appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No doubt as a result of his finding on the first
    element, no analysis was undertaken by the motions judge in connection with the
    second, third and fourth elements in Ferri’s claim.  Accordingly, it will be necessary for me to do so.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US> Element two (proceedings
    terminate in favour)</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I just concluded, the second element of <i>Nelles</i> was satisfied by Ferri because of
    the concession made by the Crown Attorneys.  The following discussion on element two, therefore, will be in
    connection with Mammoliti’s claim against the NRPD.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the opinion of the motions judge, the criminal charges
    against Mammoliti could not be said to have terminated in Mammoliti’s favour
    because they were resolved pursuant to a settlement.  At para. 29 of his reasons, he concluded as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, [the second
    element] contemplates that the charges are withdrawn without conditions or the
    accused is discharged upon a verdict of not guilty.  A settlement does not fulfill this requirement….</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The charges against Mammoliti were withdrawn by the
    Crown Attorneys and Mammoliti argues that this fact by itself is sufficient to
    satisfy the requirement that the prosecution must have terminated in his
    favour.  The NRPD relies on the case of <i>Bond v. Ontario</i>, [2002] O.J. No. 3499 at
    para. 26 (S.C.J.) to assert that where there is a bargain or some accommodation
    to dispose of criminal charges – as was the case with respect to the withdrawal
    of the charges against Mammoliti - the second element<i> </i>of the <i>Nelles</i> test will
    not be met.  A brief summary of the
    settlement to which the NRPD refers will be helpful. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mammoliti was committed to trial after a preliminary
    hearing.  All charges against him,
    however, were subsequently withdrawn by the Crown on the eve of trial on the
    following conditions:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) He surrender the documents to a place
    inaccessible to the TD Bank and Mammoliti for their safe-keeping; and, </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) He commence legal proceedings against the
    TD Bank within 30 days.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I presume the conditions were met given that the
    charges against Mammoliti were withdrawn at the request of the Crown Attorneys,
    and have not yet been reinstated.  What
    then is the legal effect of the settlement in the context of this case? </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Romegialli v.
    Marceau</i>, [1964] 1 O.R. 407 (C.A.) this court held that a withdrawal of the
    charges or stay of proceedings will constitute a favourable termination of the
    proceedings.  At the commencement of the
    trial in <i>Romegialli</i>, and in the
    absence of the accused, the Crown prosecutor requested that the charge be
    withdrawn.  The court granted the
    request without prejudice to the prosecution proceeding at a later date.  It is to be noted that the withdrawal of the
    charges in <i>Romegialli</i> was not the
    result of an agreement with the accused person, but rather, the result of a
    unilateral decision made by the Crown. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other jurisprudence has held that a compromise or settlement
    between parties that has the effect of concluding a prosecution will not amount
    to “termination” for the purpose of maintaining an action for malicious
    prosecution: <i>Baxter v. Gordon Ironsides
    &amp; Fares Co.</i> (1907), 13 O.L.R. 598 (Div. Ct.).  More recent cases have held that a prosecution is not terminated
    in favour of an accused person where the charges against that person are
    withdrawn after he or she enters into a peace bond or pays an amount to
    charity: <i>Bond</i>, <i>supra</i>; see also <i>Hunt v.
    Ontario</i>, [2004] O.J. No. 5284 (S.C.J.). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Merely finding such an arrangement, agreement or compromise,
    however, should not, in my view, end the court’s analysis of an action for
    malicious prosecution.  For several
    reasons, which are not intended to be exhaustive, I believe there should be a
    further analysis into the underlying reasons on the part of the Crown and
    police for entering into such an arrangement, agreement or compromise.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the underlying policy of the tort of malicious
    prosecution is to allow recovery in situations where the Crown or police acted
    outside the scope of the duties of their office.  Thus, the Crown or police could avoid scrutiny by simply entering
    into an agreement, arrangement or compromise with an accused person, no matter
    how trivial, before withdrawing the charges against that person.  This would have the effect of completely
    undermining the purpose of the tort. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, it will almost always be the case that the Crown and
    police will be proceeding from a position of strength.  The accused person, who believes he or she
    was the subject of a malicious prosecution, would effectively be giving up his
    or her right to sue even in the clearest of cases in exchange for his or her
    freedom, to avoid the stigma of a criminal conviction, or perhaps, to avoid the
    costs of a trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>If the police
    or Crown, for example, are found to have entered into a settlement for the
    purpose of avoiding a civil action for malicious prosecution, the settlement,
    or underlying purpose thereof, might well amount to evidence relevant to the
    issues of reasonable and probable cause and malice.  Thus, there is, as I said earlier, a need for the court to engage
    in further examination of arrangements, agreements or compromises and their
    relevance to the second element of the <i>Nelles </i>framework.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In this case,
    the Crown Attorneys agreed to withdraw the charges against Mammoliti with,
    among other things, a view to prescribing a time limit within which Mammoliti
    could commence legal proceedings against the TD Bank</span>.  I presume, as is usual in such
    circumstances, that the agreement with Mammoliti was discussed with the NRPD
    prior to its being implemented and the charges being withdrawn.  In any case, the underlying purpose of the
    settlement and the role of the NRPD are matters for a trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In the
    circumstances of this case, the NRPD cannot rely on the Crown Attorneys’
    agreement with Mammoliti, which resulted in the charges being withdrawn, to now
    assert that the prosecution did not terminate in Mammoliti’s favour.  Given the agreement’s express
    acknowledgement of Mammoliti’s intention to initiate legal proceedings against
    the TD Bank, allowing the police to use the agreement to avoid those very
    proceedings would undermine the purpose of the tort of malicious prosecution.    In addition, without commenting on the
    purpose underpinning the agreement between the Crown Attorneys and Mammoliti,
    to find that the agreement precludes Mammoliti from pursuing a claim for
    malicious prosecution against the police would effectively sanction the holding
    out of potentially untenable bargains by the police or Crown during
    negotiations with an accused person.</span>  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In most jurisdictions in Canada, this element is a question of

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This test contains both
    a subjective and objective element. There must be both actual belief on the

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In Ontario, however, whether there was an absence of
    reasonable and probable cause in claims of malicious prosecution is not a
    question of law.  Section 108(10) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. C.43 provides that in an action for malicious prosecution, the trier of fact
    must determine whether or not there was reasonable and probable cause for

style='color:black'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It will be recalled that on June 26, 1997, Mammoliti
    was charged with extortion and possession of stolen property with a value
    exceeding $5,000.  On July 9, 1997,
    Ferri was charged with attempted extortion and theft over $5,000.  Then on February 11, 1998, they were each
    charged with attempted extortion and theft over $5,000. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>To
    have properly charged Mammoliti with extortion, the NRPD required reasonable
    belief that Mammoliti intended to obtain money from the TD Bank by threatening
    the bank with its own files.  Further,
    the NRPD needed reasonable belief that Mammoliti had no reasonable
    justification for such conduct.  For the
    theft charge, the NRPD required reasonable belief that Mammoliti took the
    bank’s files – either fraudulently or without colour of right – with the intent
    to, among other things, deprive the TD Bank of its property in the files.  And, for the possession of stolen property
    charge, the NRPD needed reasonable belief that Mammoliti knew that all or part
    of the property was stolen.  The same
    requirements underpin the charges the NRPD laid against Ferri</span>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is well settled that on a motion for summary
    judgment, the role of the motion judge is limited to deciding whether a genuine
    issue exists as to material facts requiring a trial.  Although this involves taking a hard look at the evidence
    presented, a motion judge should not attempt to find facts, assess credibility
    or decide questions of law.  If there is
    an issue of credibility, it will be virtually impossible for the moving party
    to satisfy the requirements of Rule 20: <i>1061590 Ontario Ltd. v. Ontario Jockey Club</i> (1995)<i>, </i>21 O.R. (3d) 547 (C.A.); <i>Irving

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motions judge was satisfied that Mammoliti’s
    request for $500,000 for the return of the bank’s files was sufficient to
    establish reasonable and probable cause for the police to charge him with
    extortion and theft.  In other words, <span
lang=EN-US>the motions judge considered nothing
    else in the circumstances relevant to the belief of the NRPD in Mammoliti’s
    probable guilt</span>.  Respectfully, I

    reasons that he engaged in such a consideration.  Below I set out some of the additional relevant facts and

    Mammoliti and Ferri were charged.  Consequently, among other things, the NRPD was, or is to be viewed as
    being aware, of the following: </span></p>

    to the purchase and sale agreement between Ferri and the TD Bank, TD Bank had
    the right to remove any of its records and files from the building prior to the
    closing date.  Those files left behind
    could be seen to have been deemed worthless and not confidential, and thus left
    behind to be cleaned up by Ferri; </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On or
    about May 15, 1997, the TD Bank received a call from Ferri, who told the bank
    that he did not want any trouble and that he was holding the files in
    storage.  Ferri said he would return the
    files to the TD Bank, but not until he got a release from the TD Bank
    protecting him from lawsuits or damages.  Ferri indicated that he would contact his lawyer and get a release
    prepared for review by the TD Bank; </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Discussions were ongoing amongst Ferri, the TD Bank

    individual that he had read the person’s credit application file.  The TD Bank officials then contacted the

    the documents.  The security department

    June 23, 1997, the NRPD formed the opinion that the TD Bank was the victim of a
    theft and was now being extorted for the return of its property.  On June 17, 1997, however, the TD Bank
    received a letter from a lawyer representing Mammoliti, wherein Mammoliti took
    the position that the files had been abandoned.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is in this context – or this state of circumstances
    - that the motions judge had to examine both the objective and subjective
    standard of care exercised by the NRPD and the Crown Attorneys.  The question for him was whether, in these
    circumstances, a trier of fact could only reasonably find that an ordinarily
    prudent and cautious person, in the position of the NRPD, could conclude that
    Mammoliti was probably guilty of extortion and theft.  Or, did the evidence allow for another inference, namely, that
    there was an absence of reasonable and probable cause?  The answer in this case seems clear; the
    evidence on the motion does not allow for the sole inference that reasonable
    and probable grounds existed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my opinion, the
    motion judge failed to consider and assess the totality of facts that were known
    to the NRPD on June 27, 1997, and again on February 11, 1998, including: (i)
    that given the purchase and sale agreement between Ferri and The TD Bank, Ferri
    had some – albeit an unclear right - to deal with the files; (ii) that
    Mammoliti had possession of the files, having been properly hired by Ferri to
    remove and store them; (iii) the identities and whereabouts of Mammoliti and
    Ferri were known to the police; and (iv) the names and addresses and contact
    information of lawyers representing both Mammoliti and Ferri. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When
    the totality of the facts is considered, this evidence suggests that the
    constituent elements of the offences contemplated, and with which Mammoliti was
    subsequently charged, were almost entirely absent.  Nevertheless, it appears that the NRPD failed to take, or even
    consider taking, reasonable steps to ensure that the necessary components of
    the offences existed.  Indeed, there is
    a virtual absence of evidence that the NRPD made any attempt to interview
    either Mammoliti or his legal counsel</span>. In my view, this operates against
    both a subjective and objective belief of reasonable and probable cause.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All of the above, I conclude, needs to be examined and
    determined through the lens of a trial so that the evidence can be properly
    weighed and issues of credibility can be determined by a trier of fact.  In the circumstances of this case, <span
lang=EN-US>these functions cannot be properly
    conducted in a summary judgment setting in which the evidence relied upon is in
    the form of affidavit evidence</span>.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn next to Ferri’s claim against the NRPD and the third
    element of <i>Nelles</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
    would rely upon my discussion of this issue above in connection with Mammoliti
    to demonstrate the motions judge’s error.  In Ferri’s case, however, there are additional facts of which the NRPD
    had knowledge</span>.  For example, the <span
lang=EN-US>NRPD knew
    that in a letter from a lawyer for the TD Bank to lawyers for Ferri and
    Mammoliti, as well as to Mammoliti, dated June 13, 1997, the TD Bank did not
    allege that the files had been stolen.  As well, the NRPD was aware that Ferri had not demanded $500,000 and
    that Mammoliti had possession of the documents. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>My
    conclusion therefore is the same; that is, whether the NRPD had reasonable and probable
    cause to arrest and charge Ferri is a genuine issue for trial.  The motions judge was wrong to decide this. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, in concluding my discussion on element three,
    I turn to the claim by Ferri against the Crown Attorneys.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The subjective and objective belief of the Crown
    Attorneys as to whether reasonable and probable cause existed – as it is with
    the NRPD - is a question of fact that must be decided by a trier of fact.  On the motion Ferri was therefore required
    to demonstrate that there is a triable issue regarding the Crown Attorneys
    belief in reasonable and probable cause.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I previously noted, in Ontario where a civil action is
    tried by a judge and jury, it is the jury who must decide whether reasonable
    and probable cause existed.  Thus, if there
    are material facts in dispute that must be ascertained – such as, the facts
    upon which the Crown Attorneys acted, or the facts that pointed to Ferri’s
    innocence – those facts become matters for a trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ferri’s evidence is that <span lang=EN-US>Vaddacchino</span> did not believe in the
    justice of the prosecution.  Vaddacchino
    denies this.  If Ferri’s evidence is
    accepted over that of Vaddacchino, a jury might reasonably decide that this
    amounts to an absence of belief in reasonable and probable cause: see for
    example <i>Carroll v. Montsion et al.</i> (1991), 74 Man. R. (2d) 63 (Q.B.).  However, this requires a weighing of their respective evidence and an
    assessment of credibility.  These
    functions cannot be achieved in a summary judgment motion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the Crown Attorneys doubted the honesty of prosecuting
    Ferri, and failed to take reasonable steps to eliminate this doubt, they may
    then be considered to have failed to continue to hold a belief in reasonable
    and probable cause.  This result would
    be possible even though the original accusation against Ferri had some
    foundation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, there is evidence in this case that strongly
    pointed to Ferri’s innocence.  For
    example, and as I have already noted, by<span lang=EN-US> January 1998, the Crown Attorneys knew: (i)
    that Ferri had not demanded $500,000 from the TD Bank; (ii) that Ferri had
    hired Mammoliti to remove the boxes from the building; and, (iii) that Ferri
    had permission to enter the property before closing for the purpose of taking
    measurements, getting estimates and to clean up “somewhat”. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are, in my view, triable issues with respect to the
    issue of whether the Crown Attorneys had reasonable and probable grounds on
    which to prosecute Ferri for theft and attempted extortion. </p>

    determining whether malice is present in any particular case, a court must
    consider “the totality of all the circumstances” of the case: <i>Proulx</i>, at para. 37. </span>  The motions judge’s task, therefore, was to

    in fact, supported it.  While this by

    probable cause is contrary to the law and demands a credible explanation,

    agree with the NRPD that if there are reasonable and probable grounds to
    arrest, there is no false arrest or false imprisonment.  However, as I have already concluded,
    reasonable and probable cause in this case is an issue for trial.  And, although this may be evidence of
    whether or not there was a false arrest or false imprisonment, the test for
    these torts is at the date of the arrest and imprisonment: <i>Nicely v. Waterloo Regional Police</i> <i>(Chief of Police) </i>(1991), 2 O.R. (3d) 612 at 618 (Div.

    there is no continuation of the act which caused the damage - as here, where

    damage” as that phrase is used in s. 7 of the <i>Public Authorities Protection Act</i>: <i>Nicely</i>, <i>supra</i>, at
    619-620.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[104]<span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have read the careful reasons of LaForme J.A., but find that I cannot agree
    with his conclusion that it was not apparent that the respondents did not have
    reasonable and probable grounds to prosecute the appellants.  On the view of the facts I take, the actions
    of the appellants had a character not apparent in LaForme J.A.’s reasons and
    lead me to conclude the appeals should be dismissed entirely. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the appellants’ actions for malicious prosecution were properly
    dismissed because there was no genuine issue for trial regarding the third and
    fourth steps of the <i>Nelles </i>test.  The Supreme Court’s judgment in <i>Nelles</i>, <i>supra</i>, establishes
    a four-step legal test for malicious prosecution.  I agree with LaForme J.A.’s finding that elements 1 and 2 of the <i>Nelles </i>test are satisfied on the facts in Ferri’s case, and that in Mammoliti’s
    case element 1 is satisfied and there is a genuine issue for trial as to
    element 2.  I disagree, however, with
    LaForme J.A.’s conclusion that steps 3 and 4 of the <i>Nelles </i>test are
    satisfied in both cases and will explain my reasons more fully, below.  These reasons also lead to the conclusion
    that the appellants’ actions for negligence and <i>Charter </i>breaches should
    also be dismissed.  I agree, for the
    reasons given by LaForme J.A. that the actions for false arrest and false
    imprisonment were properly dismissed. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Malicious Prosecution</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3) The proceedings

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4) The defendant must
    have acted out of malice or for a primary purpose other than that of carrying
    the law into effect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    discuss first whether the respondents had reasonable and probable grounds to
    prosecute the appellants, as this is fundamental to the analysis of the other
    issues.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Essential Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is one fact I regard as especially illuminating.  After removing approximately 2,000 boxes of confidential
    documents from the TD Bank (the “Bank”) building, Ferri placed them in
    storage.  If Ferri had removed the
    documents under the innocent and misguided belief he was cleaning out the
    building, he would have had Mammoliti take them to a dump for disposal.  Instead, he placed the documents in storage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    this in mind, I offer the following account of the essential facts, which
    differs from the account set out by LaForme J.A. only in tone.  I add detail to certain events and highlight
    some of the evidence the respondents had when they initiated and continued the
    prosecution of the appellants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    agreement dated March 12, 1997, Ferri, through his business Universal
    Management Consultants Inc., contracted to purchase a property in Welland from
    the Bank.  Though the building was unoccupied,
    the branch at that location having closed, a great many documents remained
    stored there.  In his offer to purchase
    the property, Ferri had included the clause: “The Vendor agrees to remove all
    bank records and files stored in the building prior to closing.”  The responsible Bank official, Robert
    Deutschmann, had crossed out this clause and inserted the clause: “The
    Purchaser accepts the building in an ‘as is’ condition”.  The transaction, originally scheduled to
    close on May 30, 1997, closed on June 2, 1997.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior
    to closing, the Bank gave Ferri permission to enter the building in the
    following terms: “O.K. to get measurements, estimates and <u>cleanup somewhat</u> with Realtor opening up.”  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    couple of weeks prior to closing, Ferri hired Mammoliti to remove approximately
    2,000 banker boxes of confidential records that the Bank was storing in the
    building and moved them into storage.  Ferri told no one at the Bank that he intended to remove the boxes or
    that he had done so.  Until Bank staff
    went to the building on May 13, 1997 to sort through the documents and remove
    those the Bank did not wish to leave in the building when the transaction
    closed, no one was aware they had been taken.  Even the real estate agent who had let Ferri into the building on
    several occasions under the above permission did not know the boxes had been
    taken.  He could remember only one
    occasion when he had left Ferri unattended in the building and then only for a
    short period of time.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[122]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the Bank began making inquiries about the missing documents, Deutschmann
    received a call from Ferri on May 15, 1997.  Deutschmann’s Will Say <br>
    Statement that he provided to the police states that Ferri had called,
    “indicating that he had our Bank files.  He also said that he did not want any trouble and that he was holding
    them in storage.”  Ferri went on to
    demand a release of liability, an indemnification agreement in case of a suit
    by the Bank’s clients, and money to cover the costs he incurred in moving and
    storing the documents.  Over the next
    week, Deutschmann “followed up a number of times with Mr. Ferri but … did not
    receive a call back.”  Deutschmann then
    called the lawyer who had represented Ferri in the real estate transaction, who
    reiterated Ferri’s position that he would return the files if given a release
    and money to cover his expenses.  On May
    30, 1997 the lawyer indicated Ferri wished to deal with the form of the release
    prior to dealing with costs, but indicated the costs “were now estimated at the
    $4,000 level.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    a release and confidentiality agreement had been prepared, and the Bank was
    ready to proceed, Deutschmann phoned the lawyer to request a copy of the
    invoices to support Ferri’s claim for costs.  The lawyer did not return Deutschmann’s phone call, and after
    Deutschmann made several more efforts to reach him, the lawyer sent him a fax
    on June 6, 1997 indicating that the Bank should deal directly with
    Mammoliti.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to Deutschmann’s statement, he called Mammoliti and told him that Bank wanted
    its files returned.  Deutschmann’s
    statement continues: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>He asked me how much
    we were willing to pay for his files. … He said, ‘I want a half a million
    dollars.  My price is going up if I
    don't hear back from you by next Tuesday (June 10) and if we can’t settle I
    will sell your files.’  I asked him to
    repeat the amount.  He confirmed the
    half a million dollar figure.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[125]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Needless
    to say, it would be reasonable to consider that the documents, even if relating
    to old transactions, were of enormous value to the Bank in terms of goodwill
    and the maintenance of its clients’ confidence in the security of their
    financial information.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    June 9, 1997, the day before the June 10 deadline, the Bank called the police
    who indicated they would contact Mammoliti.  Later that day, a lawyer phoned Deutschmann “who said he was calling
    regarding the files on behalf of Mr. Mammoliti, however, he was not formally
    representing Mr. Mammoliti.  He asked
    for clarification. … [He] said he would talk to Mr. Mammoliti and get back to
    us [the Bank].”  On June 11, 1997, the
    lawyer phoned back and “stated that Mr. Mammoliti was treating the situation as
    an abandonment of files where he had an ownership interest and that we should
    negotiate on this basis.”  On June 12,
    1997, Mammoliti left a message for the Bank’s security officer, who had been
    trying to reach him, that he would communicate with the Bank only through the
    lawyer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[127]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    June 13, 1997, a customer (Mr. Tellier) phoned the branch manager to express
    concern that Mammoliti had seen his mortgage application file.  When the police interviewed Tellier, they
    learned he was Ferri’s brother-in-law.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[129]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    July 3, 1997, Ferri’s lawyer, in an obvious effort to persuade the Crown not to
    charge his client, wrote to Crown Attorney Root.  The letter expressed the opinion that “it was reasonable for the
    purchaser to begin to remove the files and records as part of its permission to
    ‘cleanup somewhat’”.  The letter from
    Ferri’s lawyer noted, “At no time during the negotiations with the vendor did I
    or my client, ever assert a claim for ownership of the records and files.”  The letter stated that Ferri had wished to
    be reimbursed for his expenses and indicated, “In an earlier conversation with
    the vendor I had requested the sum of approximately $4,600.00 dollars.”  Finally, the lawyer’s letter remarked, “The
    purchaser advised me that his costs would include out of his pocket expenses
    for manpower, truck rental, storage that was leased on a month to month basis
    requiring a full month’s notice to terminate and legal fees for the ongoing
    negotiations.”</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-GB>Crown Attorney Root was not

    for Crown Attorneys Root and Vaddacchino questioned whether Ferri’s real estate

    contents, a matter the record makes clear.  I have proceeded on the basis that the respondents were aware of all the
    information in the real estate file upon which the appellants rely.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Element Three – Reasonable and
    Probable Grounds</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[132]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first issue is whether the totality of the information the respondents had or
    could reasonably obtain at the time provided them with reasonable and probable
    grounds to consider that the appellants had committed the offences of theft
    over $5,000 and attempted extortion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[133]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that knowledge of the negotiations that led to the Agreement
    of Purchase and Sale (the “Agreement”), the permission given to Ferri to
    “cleanup somewhat”, and Ferri’s later position that Mammoliti had possession
    and control of the files should have made the respondents realize they lacked
    reasonable and probable grounds to institute and continue the prosecution
    against the appellants together or individually.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[134]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view this position does not withstand scrutiny.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[135]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    approaching this analysis I take a different view of the legal effect of the
    Agreement.  I cannot agree that the
    Agreement gave Ferri even an “unclear” right to deal with the files.  It is a basic proposition of real estate law
    that chattels are not included in a conveyance of real property: see <i><span
lang=EN>Conveyancing and Law of Property Act</span></i><span
lang=EN>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.34, s. 15(1);  <i>Lichty v. Voigt </i>(1977), 17 O.R. (2d)
    552 (Co. Ct.); </span><i>Stack v. T. Eaton Co. </i>(1902), 4 O.L.R. 335 at 338
    (Div. Ct.).  An “as is” clause, such as
    the one in this case, does not convey title to any chattels as it applies only
    to the freehold: see <i><span lang=EN>Weitzner v.
    Herman</span></i><span lang=EN>, [2000] O.J. No.
    906 (S.C.J.)</span>.  For greater
    clarity, the Agreement did contain a list of the chattels being conveyed.  The boxes of documents were not included on
    the list.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[136]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    even if one accepts that the course of negotiations gave Ferri the subjective
    belief that the Bank intended to abandon the files in the building being
    conveyed, Ferri had no reason to believe he acquired any property interest in
    anything before the transaction closed.  We must remember that these boxes were removed from the Bank’s premises
    well before closing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[137]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
    as I see it, the claim that Ferri had a credible and reasonable belief that he
    had the right to remove the documents prior to closing must be based, not on
    the Agreement, but on the permission he was given to enter the building and
    perform a minor cleanup.  This seems to
    be Ferri’s position.  It is worth
    recalling that Ferri’s lawyer in his letter to Root dated July 3, 1997
    emphasized that Ferri never claimed any ownership interest in the files and that
    “it was reasonable for the purchaser to begin to remove the files and records
    as part of its permission to ‘cleanup somewhat’”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[138]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents could reasonably regard the appellants’ claim that the documents
    were removed as part of a minor cleanup as not credible.  In my view, an ordinarily prudent and
    reasonable person would have a hard time believing that consent given by a
    seller to a purchaser to “cleanup” a building “somewhat” before closing the
    transaction could be understood as permitting the surreptitious removal of some
    2,000 banker boxes of confidential documents.  It may be inferred from Ferri’s demand of a release and indemnification
    agreement that he realized the boxes contained sensitive client information.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[139]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This,
    however, is not the most striking discrepancy between the appellants’ position
    and reasonable expectations.  Even
    supposing we understand the consent to perform a minor cleanup in the
    far-fetched way proposed by the appellants, a reasonable person would expect
    that once the boxes were cleaned out they would be taken to a dump for disposal
    rather than being placed in storage.  The fact the appellants’ placed the boxes in storage is post-offence
    conduct which is highly probative of their state of mind when they removed the
    boxes from the building.  Incurring the
    cost of storage is consistent only with an intention to keep the documents for
    some future purpose.  Absent any
    explanation, the respondents could reasonably consider that the trier of fact
    would conclude that the appellants intended to use the documents in the way
    they in fact did use them – to demand money from the Bank for their return.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[140]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, it would have been necessary for Ferri to testify at a criminal trial
    that he believed the consent he was given to “cleanup somewhat” permitted him
    to remove approximately 2,000 boxes of documents which contained, as he seems
    to have realized, sensitive client information.  Under cross-examination he would have had to explain why he
    placed the boxes in storage.  If there
    was an explanation, it was not provided to the respondents.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[141]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    cross-examination, Ferri could also have been expected to be asked about the
    inconsistency of his eventual position that Mammoliti had possession and
    control of the files with his initial position that he had the documents in
    storage and had incurred expenses removing them.  Ferri would have had to explain how Mammoliti came to have
    possession and control of the files that Ferri first claimed to have in storage
    and the ability to return.  Ferri would also
    have had to explain why, even after he told the Bank to deal with Mammoliti, he
    still refused to disclose the location where he had the files stored.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[142]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents were justified in taking the view that the trier of fact would have
    to believe Ferri’s testimony on all of these points.  As no explanations were provided to them, the Crown Attorneys
    could not be expected to conclude that Ferri’s position was credible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[143]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    Ferri did not personally make the demand for $500,000, there was much
    circumstantial evidence that Mammoliti and he were acting in concert.  Both Ferri and his lawyer had made clear
    that it was Ferri who had incurred expenses to have the files removed and
    stored.  Ferri had hired Mammoliti.  The Bank customer who phoned the Bank shortly
    after the deadline imposed by Mammoliti had expired to complain that someone
    had seen his personal bank records was Ferri’s brother-in-law.  Ferri did not disclose where he had stored
    the files when he directed the Bank to deal with Mammoliti, thus making
    possible Mammoliti’s demand for $500,000.  Based on the totality of circumstances, the respondents could therefore
    reasonably take the view that the evidence, if accepted, would establish that
    the appellants had committed the acts necessary to support the charges.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[144]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ferri’s
    final position that Mammoliti controlled the files, without any explanation of
    his change from his initial position that “he was holding the files in
    storage”, would rightly be viewed by the Crown Attorneys as an attempt of one
    accused to shift responsibility to a co-accused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[145]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    far as Mammoliti is concerned, the respondents had only one version of the
    conversation in which Mammoliti demanded $500,000 from the Bank.  That was Deutschmann’s version, which is set
    out above.  That version clearly
    established that Mammoliti was threatening the Bank and raised the question to
    whom Mammoliti intended to sell the files if the Bank did not meet his price. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[146]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mammoliti’s
    version as set out in his affidavit cannot be considered in assessing whether
    the police had reasonable and probable grounds to prosecute him because it was
    not available to them at the time.  As
    Mammoliti exercised his right to silence, the respondents could not know that
    Mammoliti would eventually claim his demand for $500,000 was a joke.  On the information the respondents had,
    unless Mammoliti had some lawful justification for making the demand, the
    offence would be made out. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[147]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    lawful justification claimed by Mammoliti is what he expressed to the Bank
    through a lawyer on July 11, 1997 and maintained thereafter: the Bank abandoned
    its files and he had an ownership interest in them. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[148]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents knew that as a matter of fact the Bank had not abandoned the
    files.  The Bank had the files stored in
    a building that it still owned when Mammoliti removed them.  Bank staff had gone to the building on May
    13, 1997 to remove the files before the transaction closed only to discover
    them gone, a fact the appellants’ ignore in their letters to the Crown
    Attorneys.  The claim that the files had
    been abandoned as a matter of fact was not open to Mammoliti.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[149]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mammoliti’s
    claim, like that of Ferri, must ultimately be based on the consent to “cleanup
    somewhat” the Bank gave to Ferri.  This
    claim suffers from the same frailties.  The appellants had no hint of an explanation why Mammoliti, if he had
    been hired to clean out the building, would place the rubbish he removed in
    storage.  The fact that he placed the
    material he “cleaned out” in storage undermines the credibility of his
    claim.  His subsequent conduct makes
    evident that Mammoliti was not an unwitting contractor hired by Ferri, although
    he never suggested he was.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[150]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mammoliti’s
    position may be regarded as inculpating Ferri.  The ownership interest Mammoliti claimed in the files could only have derived
    from Ferri, who according to his counsel never claimed an interest in the
    files.  Mammoliti’s position suggests
    that in the dealings between the two of them, Ferri did purport to have the
    right to deal with the files.  The Crown
    Attorneys could regard the inconsistency in Ferri’s and Mammoliti’s positions
    as a matter that would further undermine their credibility and which they would
    be called upon to address in cross-examination at trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[151]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    determination of whether the respondents had reasonable and probable grounds to
    prosecute the appellants must be made on the basis of the information the
    respondents had at the time or could have obtained by reasonable inquiry.  New facts that the appellants may offer now are
    not relevant in determining if the respondents had reasonable and probable
    grounds at the time: see <i>Nelles</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 193.  The appellants have not identified any
    additional information they say the respondents should have obtained.  Rather, their argument is that the
    respondents ignored or refused to draw proper conclusions from the information
    that the appellants provided to them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[152]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the summary judgment motion, the task of the motion judge was to determine if
    there was a genuine issue for trial about whether the respondents, on the
    closed body of information that was reasonably available to them at the time,
    had reasonable and probable grounds for prosecuting the appellants.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[153]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    standard that applied to the Crown Attorneys in continuing the prosecution of
    Ferri may be somewhat higher than that which applies to the police in laying
    the charges.  There had to be sufficient
    evidence for the Crown Attorneys to believe that guilt could properly be proved
    beyond a reasonable doubt.  As the
    Supreme Court said in <i>R. v. Proulx, </i><span
style='color:black'>[2001] 3 S.C.R. 9</span><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;color:black'> at para. 31:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>To say that a
    prosecutor must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of an accused person’s
    guilt before bringing charges is obviously incorrect. That is the ultimate
    question for the trier of fact, and not the prosecutor, to decide. However, in our
    opinion, the Crown must have sufficient evidence to believe that guilt could
    properly be proved beyond a reasonable doubt before reasonable and probable
    cause exists, and criminal proceedings can be initiated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[154]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am satisfied there was sufficient evidence for the respondents to believe guilt
    could properly be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  The appellants had removed the Bank’s property from a building
    the Bank owned and demanded money for its return.  The information that the appellants suggest exculpated them is
    fraught with improbabilities and contradictions discussed above and summarized
    below:</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber3>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Any claim by the appellants that the Agreement gave them some
    right to remove the documents before closing was wrong in law;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber3>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The claim by the appellants that the surreptitious removal of
    approximately 2,000 boxes of documents known to contain financial information
    about the Bank’s customers was permitted by the consent they received to
    “cleanup somewhat” was not credible;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber3>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Placing the documents in storage was fundamentally
    inconsistent with the appellants’ claim that they were removed as part of a
    cleanup;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber3>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Deutschmann’s version of Mammoliti’s demand for $500,000 or he
    would begin selling the documents was not contradicted; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber3>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was ample circumstantial evidence upon which the trier
    of fact would find that Ferri and Mammoliti were acting in concert.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[155]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    see no basis upon which the respondents were bound to accept the information
    provided by appellants’ counsel as establishing that there was a reasonable
    doubt their clients were not guilty of the charges.  While appellants’ counsel contended vigourously that their
    clients were given permission to remove the files as part of a minor cleanup,
    they did not provide the respondents with any information to make that claim
    plausible.  Counsel did not provide
    statements from the appellants that they did in fact honestly and sincerely
    believe they had the right to remove the documents.  Nor did they address the fundamental inconsistency of placing
    documents considered rubbish in storage.  They did not indicate what the appellants planned to do with the stored
    documents.  They did not offer the
    respondents any alternative version of the conversation with Deutschmann in
    which Mammoliti demanded $500,000 from the Bank or he would begin selling the
    documents.  Ferri’s lawyers did not
    attempt to reconcile Ferri’s assertion that he incurred expenses for manpower,
    truck rental, and continuing storage with his position adopted after June 6,
    1997 that he did not have possession or control of the files.  Nor did Ferri’s counsel account for why
    Ferri did not disclose the location where he had stored the documents after he
    took the position that he really was not involved.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[156]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    lawyer’s letter dated June 11, 1997 to the Bank on behalf of Mammoliti
    indicated that Mammoliti claimed the Bank had abandoned the files and asserted
    his ownership of them.  It does not
    explain how files being stored by the Bank in a building owned by the Bank
    should be considered abandoned and does not address how Mammoliti came to own
    them.  Moreover, while the letter claims
    Mammoliti had control of the documents, it did not explain what had changed
    from the time Ferri had indicated he had them in storage and could return them.  Mammoliti provided no information during the
    course of the prosecution about how he, a contractor hired by Ferri completely
    uninvolved in the real estate transaction, came to have ownership of the
    documents.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[157]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    short, the appellants’ lawyers provided the respondents with contentions but no
    evidence to bolster the credibility of their clients.  The facts provided the respondents with abundant reason to doubt
    the credibility of positions advanced on behalf of the appellants.  In addition to the matters reviewed above,
    the police knew that Ferri had previously been convicted of a fraud in the
    amount of $9,000,000 for which he later was pardoned.  The respondents do not seek to rely on this information, but in
    my view they could have taken it into consideration as it was evidence relevant
    to credibility that might have become admissible at trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[158]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents could not through further investigation discover answers to these
    questions.  The respondents did meet
    with and listen to appellants’ counsel and consider the information they put
    forward.  However, as I see it, and with
    due respect to the views of others, the respondents, on the totality of the
    information the respondents possessed during the course of the prosecution,
    were justified in believing they possessed sufficient evidence to prove guilt
    beyond a reasonable doubt.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[159]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would therefore conclude that on the objective standard the respondents had
    reasonable and probable grounds to initiate and proceed with the prosecution
    against the appellants.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[160]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would also take a different view of the evidence regarding whether the
    respondents subjectively believed they had reasonable and probable grounds to
    prosecute the appellants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[161]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the evidence did not raise a genuine issue for trial as to whether
    Crown Attorney Vaddacchino subjectively believed she had the requisite
    reasonable and probable grounds.  In her
    affidavit and on her cross-examination, Vaddacchino swore she believed she had
    sufficient evidence to prosecute Ferri.  Ferri’s affidavit, where he was required to put his best foot forward,
    does not seem to me to contradict Vaddacchino’s claims.  The evidence he filed, in my view, only
    raised the question of whether Vaddacchino, a contract Crown Attorney unsure if
    the Attorney General would pay the costs of defending her from the civil law
    suits with which the appellants were menacing her, may have preferred that the
    case be dealt with civilly.  Victims can
    bring civil actions to address the subject matter of many, if not most criminal
    prosecutions.  The fact that the Bank
    could have brought a civil action against the appellants does not affect
    whether the respondents had reasonable and probable grounds to prosecute
    them.  I do not regard evidence that
    might suggest Vaddacchino may have preferred that the case be dealt with
    civilly to in any way undermine the evidence before the motion judge that she
    believed she had reasonable and probable grounds to initiate and continue the
    criminal prosecution. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Element Four – Malice</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[162]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants filed evidence that they say suggests the respondents prosecuted
    them because they were pressured to do so by the Bank.  The Bank complained to the police, refused
    the appellants’ entreaties to withdraw its complaint, and made clear it wished
    the appellants prosecuted.  This does
    not, to me, constitute evidence that raises a genuine issue as to whether the
    respondents misused their criminal law power by prosecuting the
    appellants.  Victims of crime may be
    expected to, and do in fact, pressure the authorities to enforce the criminal
    law against those who have injured them by criminal conduct.  The fact the Bank refused to withdraw its
    complaint and wished the police to continue the prosecution does not raise a
    genuine issue for trial as to whether the respondents acted with malice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[163]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not place any significance on the fact that the police attempted to
    recover the files from Mammoliti.  The
    appellants call this a failed “sting operation” and cite it as confirmation
    that the police were misusing their power to assist the Bank in getting the
    documents back.  I see nothing sinister
    in this.  Attempting to recover stolen
    property is clearly a proper role of the police.  In this case, recovery of the documents was very much in the
    public interest as the financial information of a great many people was at
    risk.  As Mammoliti had threatened to
    sell the files, it was urgent for the Bank to recover them as soon as possible
    and reduce the potential that they might fall into the hands of “identity
    fraudsters”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[164]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
    analysis of Ferri’s attempt to undermine the subjective belief of Crown

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[165]<span

    damages.  Mere negligence is not
    sufficient to succeed on this ground: see <i>McGillivary</i>, <i>supra</i>, at
    108.  Malice, on the other hand, may be
    sufficient to satisfy the bad faith requirement.  As I have concluded, there is no genuine issue for trial on the
