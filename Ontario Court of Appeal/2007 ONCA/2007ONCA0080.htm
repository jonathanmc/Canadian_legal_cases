  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On a motion for release pursuant
      to s. 20(c) of the <i>Extradition Act</i> pending the determination of
      the judicial review of the decision of the Minister of Justice dated December
      14, 2006, and on a motion to expedite the judicial review of the decision
      of the Minister of Justice dated December 14, 2006.</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Schreiber (the applicant) applies for bail pending determination of his judicial
    review application.  That application is opposed by the Crown (the respondent),
    which seeks an order expediting the judicial review. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown concedes that it has no concern that the applicant will either flee
    or re-offend if released.  Indeed, the applicant has complied with all terms
    during the many years he has been on release.  However, the Crown opposes
    Mr. Schreiber’s current application on the basis that the judicial review
    is frivolous.  In the alternative, the Crown argues that, even if not frivolous,
    the merits of the judicial review are so weak that, when combined with the
    delay caused by seven and a half years of extradition hearings, judicial
    reviews and appeals, it is in the public interest to detain the applicant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    judicial review, the second in these extradition proceedings, is based on
    comments reported in the German press attributed to the chief prosecutor
    and the judicial spokesperson for the regional court in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Augsburg,
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Germany</st1:country-region>
    .  Those comments were reported in March 2006 in the days following this
    court’s dismissal of the applicant’s first judicial review and appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    those reports, the chief prosecutor is reported as having given his opinion
    that the applicant would “definitely be imprisoned on remand”
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Germany</st1:country-region>
    .  In addition, the court spokesperson, a judge, is reported as having referred
    to the applicant as “the trigger of the entire affair and has caused damage
    to
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Germany</st1:country-region>
  ”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the basis of those comments and others, the applicant sought a reconsideration
    of the Minister of Justice’s earlier surrender order, arguing that the comments
    reflected a prejudgment of the bail hearing and an abuse of process of sufficient
    gravity to violate the fundamental principles of justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    December 14, 2006, the Minister refused to reconsider his surrender decision.
    In doing so, he distinguished this case from <i>United States of America
    v. Cobb</i> (2001), 152 C.C.C. (3d) 270 (S.C.C.) on the facts.  He also noted
    that neither the chief prosecutor nor the judicial spokesperson was assigned
    to the applicant’s trial in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Germany</st1:country-region>
    and, as well, that the fact of different processes in the extradition partner’s
    justice system, such as a judicial spokesperson, “does not mean that they
    are fundamentally unfair”.  It is the Minister’s refusal to reconsider his
    surrender decision that is the subject of the judicial review.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am unable to agree that the judicial review is frivolous because it does
    raise issues for consideration.  However, in my view, the grounds for judicial
    review are far from strong. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relying on the public interest grounds, as I have said, the Crown is not
    concerned with the possibility that the applicant will commit further offences
    or interfere with the process of justice.  Rather, the Crown’s concern rests
    with
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ’s obligation to fulfill its international commitments and to enforce the
    surrender order.  In this sense, the Crown emphasizes the public interest
    in enforcing the surrender order over the public interest in the reviewability
    of that order. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    <st1:country-region w:st="on"><i>Trinidad and Tobago</i></st1:country-region>
    <i> (Republic) v. Raghoonanan</i> (2003), 173 C.C.C. (3d) 294 (Ont.
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) Simmons J.A. noted, in the extradition context, that the public interest
    in having a committal order enforced “weighs less heavily” against the granting
    of bail than does the public interest in the immediate enforcement of a sentence
    following a criminal conviction.  In response, the Crown argues that the
    enforcement interest should be given more weight in this case because this
    is not simply the enforcement of a committal order, but of both committal
    and surrender orders that have been upheld throughout the judicial process,
    to and including the Supreme Court of Canada. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    even in these circumstances, I am of the view that there continues to be
    an important distinction between judicial interim release following extradition
    orders and release following sentencing dispositions.  In the case of conviction
    and sentence, the applicant has been convicted of an offence and the Crown
    is seeking to maintain the enforceability of the order for punishment.  With
    a surrender order, the applicant has not been found guilty of any crime;
    he continues to be presumed innocent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown understandably raises the concern many would have that these proceedings
    have continued for seven a half years, at what this court has described as
    a “snail’s pace”.  However, the reason for this delay is rooted in our procedures
    for extradition.  The Crown does not suggest that the applicant has caused
    delay by his conduct of these proceedings. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the public interest does not lie in imprisoning Mr. Schreiber simply
    out of frustration about the years these extradition proceedings have endured.  Moreover,
    in this case, imprisoning the applicant will not serve the purpose sought
    by the Crown of enforcing the extradition, but in the absence of any other
    relevant concerns, will only serve to punish the applicant for availing himself
    of the very procedural avenues provided by Parliament.  Accordingly, while
    the delay in this case is both frustrating and inordinate, it cannot be relevant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    saying this, I recognize the public interest that
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    fulfills its international obligations promptly.  However, this new judicial
    review is based on statements allegedly made by the German prosecutor and
    spokesperson following the release of this court’s decision.  Accordingly,
    there are new grounds for this judicial review.  It is not simply a thinly-veiled
    attempt to relitigate earlier dispositions.  Thus, I would grant the application
    for bail.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    as the Crown submits, this case does cry out for an expeditious disposition
    because
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Germany</st1:country-region>
    has suffered prejudice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Greenspan argues against the Crown’s expedition motion for two reasons.  First,
    he wishes to undertake further investigation on the applicant’s behalf, including
    obtaining an affidavit about the role of the court spokesperson in the German
    justice system.  Second, Mr. Greenspan is committed to a lengthy trial in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Chicago from March until June. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regarding
    the first point, any further investigation needed for the applicant’s case
    can be completed with dispatch.  In saying this, I note that the German press
    reports date back to March 2006 and the applicant has had the Minister’s
    refusal to reconsider his surrender order since December 14, 2006.  On the
    second point, Mr. Greenspan’s
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Chicago commitment leaves him available on Fridays, absent any untoward scheduling
    problems with that case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    seems to me that the factors at issue are balanced fairly if the appeal is
    expedited for hearing to May 4, 2007.  The applicant shall perfect his judicial
    review by March 23 and the respondent shall deliver its materials by April
    13.  The appellant will be allowed fifty minutes for argument and the respondent
    thirty minutes. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, since I am persuaded that the applicant has demonstrated that
    his continued detention is not necessary in the public interest, I release
    the applicant pending the judicial review hearing on the agreed-upon terms
    that have been filed with the court.  As well, I am persuaded that this matter
    should be expedited and set May 4, 2007 as the hearing date for the judicial
    review application.      </p>
