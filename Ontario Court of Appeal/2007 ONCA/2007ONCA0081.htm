  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent killed Christopher Shelton and was charged with second degree
    murder.  He testified and claimed that he acted in self defence.  The jury
    acquitted.  The Crown appeals alleging that the trial judge erred in ruling
    that the Crown would not be permitted to cross-examine the respondent on
    some of the entries in his extensive criminal record.  The Crown also alleges
    several errors by the trial judge in her instructions to the jury.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would dismiss the appeal.  The trial judge’s ruling as to the scope of the
    Crown’s cross-examination of the respondent on his criminal record reveals
    no error in law.  While I agree with the Crown’s submission that the trial
    judge erred in her instructions concerning what I will refer to as the “one
    transaction” issue, I am satisfied that the error could not have had any
    effect on the verdict.  </p>

  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(a)  The
      Homicide</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent and Mr. Shelton did not know each other before the night of Mr.
    Shelton’s death.  By chance, the respondent and two female friends who had
    been out on the town arrived at the Golden Embassy restaurant in Toronto
    at the same time (about 2:30 a.m.) as Mr. Shelton and his friends, Mr. Trevor
    Mitchell and Mr. Darryl Sharpe.  Mr. Shelton and his friends had also been
    out on the town that evening.  Everyone had been drinking.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent was thirty years old and is a well built man.  Mr. Shelton and
    his two friends were in their early twenties (between twenty and twenty-three).  They
    were all big men, especially Mr. Shelton, who stood six feet three inches
    and weighed 228 pounds.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the respondent and his two female friends entered the restaurant, Mr. Shelton
    made a relatively innocuous remark to one of the women.  According to Mr.
    Mitchell and Mr. Sharpe, the respondent and Mr. Shelton exchanged words.  They
    testified that this exchange did not seem particularly threatening.  The
    respondent testified that he was aware of an exchange between his two friends
    and a group of men as they entered the restaurant, but that he paid little
    attention to it.  The respondent said that he did not speak to Mr. Shelton. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    two groups were seated separately in the restaurant.  Everyone was having
    something to eat and there was no interaction between the two groups.  There
    was conflicting evidence as to whether the respondent seemed agitated while
    in the restaurant.  Shortly after 3:00 a.m., the respondent left the restaurant
    to go to a bank machine.  He returned to the restaurant, but left again shortly
    afterwards.  While he was outside the second time, Mr. Shelton and his friends
    finished their meal and left the restaurant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was common ground that an altercation ensued during which the respondent
    struck Mr. Shelton in the face with a single punch.  Mr. Shelton fell straight
    backwards and his head struck the pavement with a loud thud.  It was also
    common ground that about thirty seconds to one minute after the respondent
    punched Mr. Shelton, the respondent kicked him while he was lying on the
    ground.  There was considerable dispute as to the force of the kick.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    there was agreement that the respondent punched and kicked Mr. Shelton and
    that his actions caused Mr. Shelton’s death, there were two very different
    versions of the relevant circumstances placed before the jury.  According
    to Mr. Mitchell, he and Mr. Shelton were accosted by the respondent outside
    of the restaurant.  It was the theory of the Crown that the respondent was
    upset because of the exchange between Mr. Shelton and the respondent’s friends
    when they entered the restaurant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Mitchell testified that the respondent immediately became verbally abusive
    and that Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Shelton did their best to calm him down.  Mr.
    Mitchell testified that “out of the blue”, the respondent “blindsided” Mr.
    Shelton with a vicious upper-cut punch, knocking him to the ground.  Mr.
    Shelton appeared to be unconscious before he hit the ground as he did nothing
    to break his fall.  His head struck the pavement violently.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    Mr. Shelton fell to the ground, the respondent remained belligerent and challenged
    Mr. Mitchell to a fight.  According to Mr. Mitchell, about thirty seconds
    after the punch, the respondent walked over to Mr. Shelton’s body and stomped
    on his head with his foot.  Mr. Mitchell testified that the respondent raised
    his knee to belt level and brought his foot down with terrific force on Mr.
    Shelton’s face.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Sharpe, Mr. Shelton’s other friend, was not present during the initial altercation
    involving Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Shelton and the respondent.  He did, however,
    see the respondent “sucker punch” Mr. Shelton.  According to Mr. Sharpe,
    Mr. Shelton was not ready for the punch and did nothing to defend himself.  Mr.
    Shelton fell straight backwards with his arms at his sides.  His head banged
    loudly on the pavement.  Mr. Shelton did not move once he hit the ground. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Sharpe testified that the respondent offered to continue the fight.  Less
    than a minute after he had punched Mr. Shelton, he returned to where Mr.
    Shelton was lying and kicked or stomped on his head.  Mr. Sharpe did not
    see the respondent after this.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent testified that he was outside getting some fresh air and walked
    by Mr. Shelton and Mr. Sharpe.  All of a sudden, Mr. Mitchell appeared out
    of nowhere and began to speak to him in a verbally abusive manner.  The respondent
    said he replied in an abusive manner and stepped back away from Mr. Mitchell.  Mr.
    Mitchell came towards him.  Mr. Shelton and Mr. Sharpe were standing shoulder-to-shoulder
    with Mr. Mitchell so that the three were standing in front of the respondent
    in what he took to be a threatening posture.  The respondent believed that
    if he tried to walk away at this point, he would be jumped by the three men,
    so he stood his ground and continued to exchange profanities with Mr. Mitchell.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to the respondent, Mr. Mitchell said to him,
    “We’ll kick your fucking ass”.  The respondent replied, “Oh really”.  He
    then hit Mr. Shelton.  The respondent testified that he punched Mr. Shelton
    to make the three men back away from him.  Mr. Shelton was standing closest
    to him.  He described the punch as a forceful, straight left hand aimed in
    the direction of Mr. Shelton.  The respondent could not recall who said what
    in the moments before he struck the blow, although he regarded Mr. Mitchell
    as the main protagonist.  The respondent knew he hit Mr. Shelton, although
    he could not say where he hit him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the respondent struck Mr. Shelton, he and Mr. Mitchell continued to argue.  The
    respondent said the events happened very quickly.  On his version, Mr. Mitchell
    and Mr. Sharpe moved towards him and he backed up.  The respondent backed
    away from Mr. Mitchell.  As he did so, he “side stepped” and kicked Mr. Shelton
    who was lying on the ground.  According to the respondent, the kick was not
    premeditated.  He denied that he stomped on Mr. Shelton’s head or kicked
    him with the force that one would use to kick a soccer ball.  He described
    the kick as an unthinking reaction done in the heat of the moment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    independent witness, Aminne Gafour, witnessed part of the altercation.  He
    had not been drinking that evening and was regarded by the Crown and defence
    as a credible witness.  He testified that he pulled up in his car outside
    of the restaurant and saw four or five men arguing loudly.  Three men were
    standing shoulder-to-shoulder facing another man.  He saw Mr. Shelton fall
    straight backwards, arms at his sides, like a tree.  His head slammed onto
    the pavement.  It sounded like a piece of wood hitting the ground.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Shelton was motionless and Mr. Gafour thought he was seriously hurt.  He
    went over to try to help Mr. Shelton and the respondent told him to stay
    out of it.  The respondent spoke to him in a normal tone of voice.  The argument
    among the men continued.  The respondent seemed fired up and anxious to continue
    the fight.  About forty-five seconds to one minute after Mr. Shelton fell
    to the ground, the respondent walked over to where Mr. Shelton was lying
    and delivered a forceful kick to the head.  Mr. Shelton’s head bounced off
    the ground.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Gafour checked Mr. Shelton for a pulse and realized that he was seriously
    hurt.  He decided to call 911, although Mr. Shelton’s friends told him that
    he should not do so.  The respondent became very quiet.  The respondent left
    before the police arrived.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Shelton was rushed to the hospital at 3:47 a.m.  He died at 5:00 p.m. that
    day without regaining consciousness.  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the cause of death figures in the issues raised on the appeal, I will review
    the evidence of Dr. Chiasson, a pathologist, in some detail.  Dr. Chiasson
    performed the post-mortem.  He observed three facial injuries:</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>a
    nine centimetre by three centimetre patterned abrasion running over the area
    around the right eye and up onto the forehead above the eye.  There was some
    bleeding under the skin in this area;</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>a
    small two centimetre bruise on the chin; and</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>a
    four centimetre by three centimetre superficial cut on the lower lip.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Chiasson agreed that the facial injuries were
    “medically minor”.  None of the facial bones, which are relatively fragile,
    were damaged.  The bruise on the chin and the cut lip were consistent with
    having been caused by a single punch to Mr. Shelton’s face.  The patterned
    abrasion around the eye and on the forehead above the eye was consistent
    with Mr. Shelton having been kicked or stepped on by a person wearing a shoe
    with a print that corresponded to the pattern of the abrasion on Mr. Shelton’s
    face.  Dr. Chiasson opined that the kick was administered with “not insignificant
    force”.  In cross-examination, defence counsel put the description of the
    kick given by Mr. Mitchell to Dr. Chiasson.  In his opinion, that description
    suggested a much more forceful kick than did the physical evidence of the
    injuries to Mr. Shelton’s face.</p>

line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.

    Chiasson testified that it was likely that that Mr. Shelton was rendered
    unconscious when his head struck the ground when he fell after being punched
    by the respondent.  Dr. Chiasson offered the opinion that all of the injuries
    to the skull, dura and brain itself were consistent with being caused by
    the single blow to the back of the head that occurred when Mr. Shelton fell
    to the ground and hit his head.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It is my view
    that the pattern of injuries here, including the external injuries, the injuries
    to the scalp, the injuries to the skull, subdural hemorrhage, the injuries

    of injuries that I have seen many times in the past a result of, striking

    his examination-in-chief:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    in my opinion, the <u>cause of death was complications of blunt force head
    injuries.</u></p>

left;'>Q.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
    can you explain, when you say “complications,” what are you referring to?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>Yes.  Well,
      the blunt force head injuries, I’m referring to the impact to the back
      of the head as being the major blunt force – major site of blunt force
      injury,</u> and it’s – the complication, there’s been a period of survival
      here that’s allowed the brain to swell, that’s allowed the brain to herniate,
      and ultimately as part of that, you also have these hemorrhages in the
      brain stem.  So the brain stem hemorrhages are probably the most significant
      final complication or final pathway of the injuries.  But there’s been
      a period of time that’s passed by.  <u>So, by complications, I’m referring
      to the swelling, the herniation effects, the brain getting pushed down
      into areas that it normally doesn’t.  This compresses vessels and nerves.  And
      these hemorrhages, which is also as a result of this herniation effect.  Those

      a direct bearing on the credibility of the accused as a witness.  She also

      relevant to the assessment of probative value versus prejudicial effect,
      the trial judge considered each of those factors as they arose in this
      case.  She concluded that the risk of prejudice was high.  The outcome
      of this trial turned on whether the Crown could prove that the respondent
      instigated the confrontation outside of the restaurant that resulted in
      Mr. Shelton’s death.  If the respondent was the aggressor, he was guilty
      of at least manslaughter.  The respondent claimed that Mr. Shelton and
      his friends were the instigators and that he acted in self defence.  The
      trial judge was concerned that if the jury heard that the respondent had
      eight prior convictions for assault related offences over several years,
      that it would conclude, despite instructions to the contrary, that he had
      a propensity to act violently and infer from that propensity that he had
      instigated this confrontation.  That line of reasoning, while perhaps logically
      compelling, is impermissible under the rules of evidence governing criminal
      proceedings.  A verdict that flows from such reasoning is a miscarriage

      see no error in the trial judge’s identification of potential prejudice.  Nor
      do I regard her frank acknowledgement of that potential prejudice as inconsistent
      with a recognition of the ability of juries to follow instructions.  Acknowledging
      the risk of prejudice is not tantamount to suggesting that juries will
      ignore what they are told by trial judges.  Rather, acknowledging the prejudice
      recognizes that despite proper instructions and the best of intentions
      by juries, faulty propensity based reasoning can infect a jury’s deliberations.  This

      his credibility would not be materially reduced if she edited the record
      to exclude reference to the crimes of violence.  The jury would still be
      told that the respondent was a recidivist who had committed crimes on a
      regular basis for many years.  The jury would no doubt see the very direct
      connection between many of the crimes the respondent had committed and
      his trustworthiness.  It is difficult to think that the jury’s assessment
      of the respondent’s credibility based on his criminal record would have
      been different had they known that he had committed not only some nineteen
      crimes, many of which involved dishonesty, but had also committed six additional

      defence was the only defence advanced at trial.  This defence always creates
      some complexity in the jury instruction.  In addition to the self defence
      claim, there was a factual aspect of this case that added some further
      complexity.  The respondent struck Mr. Shelton with his fist, knocking
      him to the ground.  When Mr. Shelton fell, the back of his head hit the
      ground with considerable force.  About thirty seconds to one minute later,
      the respondent kicked Mr. Shelton in the head as he was lying on the ground.  The

      Mr. Shelton by punching and kicking him.  The Crown submitted that if the
      respondent had the requisite intent for murder at any point during the
      assault, and particularly when he kicked Mr. Shelton, he was guilty of
      murder regardless of whether the kick was a cause of death.  Assuming the

      judges are quite properly reluctant to interfere with a jury’s fact finding
      function.  This is particularly so where, as in this case, counsel for
      the Crown and the accused agree that there is a genuine factual issue for
      the jury.  It is, however, well recognized that juries should not be invited
      to make factual findings, whether they relate to a Crown theory of liability
      or a defence that are not reasonably available on the evidence:  see <i>R.
      v. Fontaine</i>, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 702 at paras. 64-70;  <i>R. v. Cinous</i>,

    issue was a live one, the trial judge erred in telling the jury that it had
    to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondent’s acts constituted
    a single transaction or alternatively, that it had to be satisfied beyond
    a reasonable doubt that the respondent’s actions constituted two separate
    transactions.  The Crown took the position that the punch and the kick were
    part of a single ongoing assault.  It was incumbent on the Crown to prove
    beyond a reasonable doubt that the two acts constituted a single ongoing
    transaction.  If the Crown did not meet that burden, the jury would then
    have to determine whether the respondent was guilty of murder or manslaughter
    based either on the punch or on the kick considered as separate acts.</span></p>

      the trial judge initially proposed to leave only s. 34(2) with the jury.  Counsel

      I read Crown counsel’s submissions, he eventually accepted that it was

      and well organized.  Despite the inherent complexity in the subject matter,
      the trial judge’s instructions reduced self defence to a series of relatively
      straightforward questions for the jury’s consideration.  The trial judge

      counsel submitted that the word “willingly” should not be included in the
      instruction.  The trial judge modified her proposed instructions to accord
      with the defence position.  For example, when explaining the first component

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span

      contends that the phrase “in concert”, initially suggested by the Crown
      at trial, was inadequate and that the trial judge should have told the
      jury that Mr. Shelton had to be a party within the meaning of s. 21(1)
      of the <i>Criminal Code</i> to the alleged threat made against the respondent

    only if the respondent reasonably perceived that Mr. Shelton and his friends,
    acting together, were threatening to attack him.  Detailed instructions on
    the intricacies of s. 21, which are intended to describe the limits of accessorial
    liability, were unnecessary in the context of an instruction on the essential
    elements of self defence.  The words used by the trial judge made it clear
    to the jury that the respondent could rely on self defence only if he reasonably
    perceived that Mr. Shelton was a party to the apprehended attack on him.  The
    trial judge made this clear without introducing the complexities of an aiding
    and abetting instruction into the middle of what was already, of necessity,

      counsel went to the jury on the basis that the kick may have played a part
      in Mr. Shelton’s death.  Crown counsel made it clear to the jury, however,
      that it was the Crown’s position that the punch and the kick were part
      of the same transaction.  As it was beyond dispute that the respondent
      had caused Mr. Shelton’s death in the course of the altercation, the Crown
      took the position that it did not matter whether the kick was causative
      of the death or not.  The defence argued that the punch caused the death
      and that it was delivered in self defence.  </span></p>

      counsel for both the Crown and the defence accepted that there was a basis
      upon which the jury could find that the kick was a cause of Mr. Shelton’s
      death either alone or in combination with the punch.  The trial judge instructed
      the jury accordingly.  </span></p>

      trial judge’s instruction on causation was given in the course of her explanation
      of the respondent’s potential liability for murder or manslaughter.  The
      trial judge introduced this part of her instruction by saying: “[Y]ou do
      not consider this distinction at all unless you have first rejected the

      logic of the jury instruction suggests that the jury having found that
      the respondent acted in self defence never reached the causation question.  The
      jury’s questions quoted above (para. 68) also indicate that the jury concluded
      that the punch was the sole cause of death.  It is probable that the instruction
      on causation as it related to the kick was of no consequence to the verdict

      would, however, go further than holding that the instruction was of no
      consequence.  I do not think there was any evidentiary basis for a finding
      that the kick was a contributing cause of Mr. Shelton’s death.  Causation
      in the criminal law has a factual and legal component.  The former is concerned
      with the physical or medical cause of death.  A “but for” inquiry answers
      the factual causation question in most, but not all situations.  If the
      victim would not have died when he or she died but for the act of the accused,
      that act is a factual cause of death:  see Isabel Grant, Dorothy Chunn

      are not asked to determine factual and legal causation separately.  Instead,
      the two inquiries are joined and the jury is asked to decide whether the

      v. Nette</i>, <i>supra</i>, at paras. 46-73.  A contributing cause can
      be a cause that exacerbates an existing fatal condition, thereby accelerating
      death:  see <i>R. v. Munro and Munro</i> (1983), 8 C.C.C. (3d) 260 at 290-91

      the Crown sought to rely on the kick as a contributing cause of death,
      it was incumbent on the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
      kick was a contributing cause within the meaning of <i>R. v. </i><i>Nette</i>, <i>supra</i>.  The
      evidence adduced by the Crown went no further than to suggest there was
      some unquantifiable possibility that was less than a likelihood that the
      kick exacerbated the internal head injuries.  I agree with counsel for
      the respondent’s submission that this evidence could provide a basis for
      a finding of a causal link between the kick and Mr. Shelton’s death only
      if the jury was prepared to engage in the kind of speculation that Dr.
      Chiasson declined to engage in during his evidence.  Evidence that an act
      was possibly a cause of death cannot provide the evidentiary basis for
      a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the act significantly contributed
      to the death.  </span></p>

      also do not think that the jury could find a causal link between the kick
      and Mr. Shelton’s death on the basis of the non-medical evidence.  While
      it is true that Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Sharpe and, to a lesser extent, Mr. Gafour
      described a very forceful kick (a description which was at odds with the
      physical evidence observed by Dr. Chiasson), I think the jury would still
      have to look to the medical evidence for any insight as to the effect of
      the kick.  For the reasons already given, that medical evidence was incapable
      of forging a causal link between the kick and Mr. Shelton’s death.</span></p>

      to this point in my analysis, I have determined that the jury’s finding
      that the respondent acted in self defence when he punched Mr. Shelton must
      be accepted for purposes of the appeal.  I have also concluded that in
      all likelihood, the jury found that death was caused exclusively by the
      punch and that in any event, there was no evidentiary basis for a finding
      that the kick was a cause of death.  These two conclusions taken together
      mean that Mr. Shelton’s death was not the result of an unlawful act.  Without
      an unlawful act, the respondent cannot be said to have committed a culpable
      homicide.  By definition, Mr. Shelton’s death was a non-culpable homicide.  Homicide
      that is non-culpable is not an offence:  see <i>Criminal Code</i>, s. 222.</span></p>

      Crown submits, however, that the jury instructions on the respondent’s
      potential criminal liability based on the kick were inadequate.  The Crown
      takes particular exception to the trial judge’s instruction (<i>supra</i>,
      para. 69) in response to the jury’s questions to the effect that if the
      jury was satisfied that the punch caused Mr. Shelton’s death and was justified
      in self defence, the jury must acquit even if they concluded that the kick
      was an unlawful assault.</span></p>

      Crown refers to authorities to support its submission that an accused may
      initially act in self defence, but then go beyond the limits of that defence

      criminally liable for his subsequent conduct even if his initial reaction
      was justified in self defence:  see e.g. <i>R. v. Assiniboine</i>, [2005]

      can be no quarrel with these authorities.  Nor could anyone take exception
      with the Crown’s assertion that a person who is initially justified in
      acting in self defence is not “cloaked in legal immunity” should that person
      proceed to attack his defenseless assailant.  However, if the act that
      causes death is justified in self defence, the homicide cannot be made
      culpable by a subsequent unlawful assault no matter how morally reprehensible
      that assault may be.  </span></p>

      an act of self defence was given in response to a question which accepted
      that the
    “act of self defence” had caused death and was followed by an unlawful assault.  In
    that specific context, I think the trial judge’s answer to the jury’s question
    was correct.  It is significant that the trial judge vetted her proposed
    answer with counsel and no objection was taken by either counsel to her proposed

      leaves the Crown’s final submission.  Counsel argues that even if the kick
      was not a cause of death and the homicide was not culpable because the
      respondent acted in self defence, the kick may still provide the basis
      for the imposition of criminal liability.  The Crown submits that if the
      kick was an unlawful assault, the respondent is guilty of attempted murder
      or assault causing bodily harm depending on his state of mind at the time
      he administered the kick.  The Crown describes these as included offences
      in the charge of second degree murder.  Crown counsel referred the court
      to the <i>Criminal Code</i> provisions pertaining to included offences
      in a murder charge and, in the best tradition of the bar, to certain authorities
      that went against his argument: see <i>Criminal Code</i>, ss. 660, 662; <i>R.
      v. Chichak</i> (1978), 38 C.C.C. (2d) 489 (Alta. C.A.).</span></p>

      need not consider what offences may be properly regarded as included offences
      on a charge of second degree murder.  As the Crown acknowledges in arguing
      for criminal culpability for something less than murder based exclusively
      on the kick, this submission assumes that the kick and the punch are two
      discrete transactions.  Counts in an indictment should generally refer
      to a single transaction: see <i>Criminal Code,</i> s. 581.  Offences which
      arise out of a separate transaction cannot, in my view, be regarded as
      included offences in a charge relating to a different transaction.  They
      should be the subject of a separate count in the indictment.  </span></p>

      the Crown wanted to allege that the kick was criminal even if the homicide
      was not, the Crown should have laid a separate charge to reflect that allegation.  Fairness
      and proper notice to the respondent of the nature of his criminal jeopardy
      require nothing less.  It is much too late to raise for the first time
      on appeal a theory of culpability far removed from that advanced by the
      Crown at trial.  In so holding, I do not suggest that the respondent was
      entitled to attack Mr. Shelton with impunity after striking him in self
      defence.  Rather, I hold that the Crown is not entitled to a new trial
      on a theory of culpability that is not reflected in the indictment preferred
      by the Crown and bears no resemblance to the case advanced against the
      respondent at trial.  </span></p>
