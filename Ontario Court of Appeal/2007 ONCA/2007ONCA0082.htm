    care and, arguably, a reverse onus, both of which are expressed in a succinct
    passage in Hudson&nbsp;J.’s judgment in the leading common carrier tort case, <i>Day
    v. Toronto Transportation Commission</i>, [1940] S.C.R. 433 at 441:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

      accident occurs and the passenger is injured, there is a heavy burden on
      the defendant carrier to establish that he had used all due, proper and
      reasonable care and skill to avoid or prevent injury to the passenger.  The
      care required is of a very high degree. [Citations omitted.]</span></p>

      to the lap, with the horizontal portion lying across the thighs of the
      passenger.  The restraint locked into a down position by a ratcheting system

      judge considered the appellants’ submission that the law governing common

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>RULING:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The plaintiff seeks a pre-charge
      ruling that the instant amusement ride is governed by the law of common
      carriers.  This would produce two effects.  First it would impose a duty
      of extraordinary care upon the defendant.  Second, it would reverse the
      onus of proof, see Planidin vs. Dykes, [1984] BCJ number 907, Supreme Court.  There’s
      no direct authority in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    on this issue.  The American jurisprudence has addressed the issue directly
    but is sharply divided, there are good arguments for both positions.  The
    only case from
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario that is of any indirect assistance is the judgment of our Court of
    Appeal in Balne vs. Sunnyside Amusements, [1931] OR 549.  Although divided
    on the outcome, that panel unanimously approached the duty on the owner/operator
    of a similar amusement ride to the one before this jury on the basis of principles
    of occupier’s liability.  There’s no hint of any application of the law of
    common carriers.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>For these reasons I am unable
      to accept the submissions of the Plaintiff.  Accordingly the jury will
      be charged on principles of ordinary negligence and they will be told that
      the onus on liability lies with the plaintiff.</span></p>

      a result, the trial judge did not charge the jury that the respondent was
      a common carrier and on the related legal principles.  Rather, the trial
      judge charged the jury only on the standard law of negligence and the <i>Occupiers’ Liability
      Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;O.2:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I’ve earlier described to you
      the onus of proof.  In respect of this issue, the onus is on the plaintiffs
      to prove on a reasonable probability that Ms.</span>&nbsp;Mallais was improperly
      secured in the seat and that this situation was a direct and contributing
      cause of her injuries.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A statute of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, called the <span lang=EN-US>Occupier’s Liability Act, imposes upon
    the defendant in this case the following duty, specifically section 3 subsection
    1: </span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span lang=EN-US>“…
    An occupier of premises owes a duty to take such care as in all the circumstances
        of the case is reasonable to see that persons entering on the premises
        are reasonably safe while on the premises …”</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Subsection 2 states:</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>“… The duty of care provided for in subsection&nbsp;1
    applies whether the danger is caused by the condition of the premises or
    by an activity carried on, on the premises …”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>So it relates to the state of the premises and
    any activities on the premises.  Under the section I’ve just read to you,
    the duty of the defendant here was to take such care as was reasonably necessary
    in all the circumstances to see that persons like the plaintiff would be
    safe from injury when they came onto the premises.  To put it another way,
    the duty cast upon the defendant was to make the premises reasonably safe
    for the plaintiff.  I stress the words “reasonably safe.”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The defendant is not required to protect the plaintiff
    against risks or dangers in which they could not reasonably have been aware;
    nor is there any obligation on the defendant to guard against any unusual
    or unreasonable use of the premises by the plaintiff.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jury was asked seven questions.  The first question and the jury’s answer
    were:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.         Was the plaintiff’s injury caused by
    the failure of the defendant to take such care as in all the circumstances
    of the case was reasonable to see that the plaintiff was reasonably safe
    while on the defendant’s premises?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Answer:          No</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    is common in civil negligence actions, the jury assessed damages even though
    it had found no liability on the part of the respondent.  In response to
    questions 6 and 7, the jury assessed damages as follows:</p>

      is clear from these general and legal definitions of “common carrier” that
      it would be a long stretch to bring most amusement rides, including the
      stationary Sky Master, within a fair reading of the definitions.  The use
      of the words “transport” and “on regular routes” in the definition of “common
      carrier” and the words “from one place to another” and “by means of a vehicle,
      aircraft, or ship” in the definition of “transport” strongly suggests movement
      from one geographic location to another.  The Sky Master does not involve

      has explicitly considered whether amusement ride operators are common carriers.  However,
      they rely on four cases to suggest such a linkage: <i>Balne v. Sunnyside
      Amusements Co. Ltd.</i>, [1931] O.R. 549 (C.A.); <i>Falk (Guardian ad litem)

      not assist the appellants.  It is an amusement ride case.  However, it
      is clear that it proceeded as a standard negligence and occupiers’ liability
      case.  One judge, Middleton&nbsp;J.A., did cite a common carrier authority,
      but he did so in the midst of his discussion of the doctrine of latent
      defect.</span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The only case in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario that is of any indirect assistance is the judgment of our Court of
    Appeal in Balne vs. Sunnyside Amusements, [1931] OR 549.  Although divided
    on the outcome, that panel unanimously approached the duty on the owner/operator
    of a similar amusement ride to the one before this jury on the basis of principles
    of occupier’s liability.  There’s no hint of any application of the law of
    common carriers.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants contend that the last sentence in this passage is in error because
    Middleton&nbsp;J.A. referred to one common carrier case in his reasons (four
    judges wrote separate reasons).  In my view, even if a single reference on
    a different issue to a common carrier case could be said to rebut the “no
    hint”
    language in the trial judge’s ruling, the appellants’ contention amounts
    to a mere quibble.  The overall thrust of <i>Balne</i> was accurately captured
    in the trial judge’s ruling; <i>Balne</i> is an ordinary negligence and occupiers’ liability
    case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    same is true of the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    British Columbia case, <i>Falk</i>.  Although, it was a case dealing with
    an amusement ride, it proceeded, entirely, on the basis of ordinary negligence
    and occupiers’ liability principles.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    does <i>Kauffman</i> assist the appellants.  In <i>Kauffman</i>, three of
    the five judges held that an accident on an escalator should be assessed
    under the common carrier standard of care.  The appellants contend that the
    rationale for extending the notion of common carrier applies with equal force
    to an amusement ride.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree.  The escalator in <i>Kauffman</i> was not just any escalator, such
    as one commonly seen in a mall or a department store.  Rather, it was an
    escalator owned and operated by, and on the premises of, the Toronto Transit
    Commission.  As expressed by Kerwin&nbsp;C.J., at pp. 252 and 254, the appellant “alighted
    from a north&#8209;bound subway train at the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    St. Clair Avenue station, all of which was part of the transportation system
    operated by the respondent, Toronto Transit Commission, in the City of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto.
    … I take it that the respondent was a carrier of the appellant for hire”.  In
    the present case, there is no link of any kind between the respondent’s amusement
    ride and a transportation enterprise.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    final case relied on by the appellants is the decision of Tucker&nbsp;J.
    of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen’s Bench in <i>Rizos</i>.  In that case,
    the plaintiffs (a mother and her two year old son) were injured when they
    were thrown out of a small train that transported passengers to various venues
    at a zoo and amusement park near
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Saskatoon.  In his reasons, the trial judge mixed the legal principles relating
    to ordinary negligence cases and common carrier cases.  On the whole, however,
    the trial judge treated the train more as a mode of transportation than an
    amusement ride.  Accordingly, <i>Rizos</i>, at least in part, does support
    the appellants’ position in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary, the decisions of this court in <i>Balne</i> and the British Columbia
    Court of Appeal in <i>Falk</i> are opposed to the appellants’ position.  The
    decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Kauffman</i> does not assist
    the appellants.  Only the decision of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen’s Bench
    in <i>Rizos</i> provides a measure of support for the appellants’ argument.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    there is no Canadian case directly on point, both parties referred to the
    extensive American jurisprudence.  Interestingly, there is a sharp division
    in the jurisprudence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    some jurisdictions, courts have adopted the purpose test and held that amusement
    rides serve a different purpose than common carriers and, therefore, the
    standard of care is the ordinary negligence standard: see, for example, <i>Harlan
    v. Six Flags Over Georgia Inc.</i>, 297 S.E. 2d 468 (Ga. 1982).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    other jurisdictions, the courts have articulated the control test and held
    that since amusement rides, like common carriers, are controlled by their
    operators, they should be subject to the higher standard of care that applies
    to common carriers: see, for example, <i>Gomez v. Superior Court</i>, 113
    P. 3d 41 (
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Cal. 2005).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    American case law was put before the trial judge who noted the sharp division
    and observed “there are good arguments for both positions.”  I agree.  However,
    in the end I do not think that tests such as the purpose and control tests
    should be central to the interpretation of a longstanding, well&#8209;known
    and, ultimately, simple term like “common carrier”.  With respect to such
    a term, the primary focus should be on its natural and ordinary meaning.  In
    my view, this meaning is clear, as reflected in the general and legal definitions
    set out at the start of my analysis.  Returning to the first of those definitions,
    the <i>New Oxford Dictionary of English</i> defines “common carrier” as “a
    person or company undertaking to transport any goods or passengers on regular
    routes at agreed rates.”  Ms.&nbsp;Mallais’ ride on the respondent’s Sky
    Master does not fit within this definition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    I am not persuaded that the underlying policy rationale for the imposition
    of the higher duty of care owed by common carriers applies to the situation
    before us.  Passengers place themselves in the care and control of a common
    carrier in the expectation that they will be conveyed safely to their destination.  Safety
    is paramount and the common carrier assumes complete control to ensure safety.  The
    patron of an amusement ride, like the Sky Master, expects a thrill from the
    extremely unusual movement produced by the device.  A safe thrill, no doubt,
    but a safe thrill is inherently more risky than a safe ride.  The amusement
    ride patron is certainly as entitled to expect that the operator will “take
    such care as in all the circumstances of the case is reasonable” to ensure
    his or her safety.  However, to go beyond that and impose on the operator
    the higher duty owed by a common carrier would be inappropriate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the trial judge’s charge to the jury in terms of ordinary negligence and
    occupiers’ liability principles was correct.  In reaching this conclusion,
    I observe, parenthetically, that the trial judge’s charge on these principles
    necessarily placed a high standard of care on the respondent amusement ride
    owner/operator.</p>
