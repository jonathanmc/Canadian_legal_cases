    December 5, 2002, when the appellant granted a mortgage on his residence
    to secure a loan of approximately $94,000, he had collected but failed to
    remit to the Canadian Revenue Agency (“CRA”) approximately $51,000 GST and
    employee tax deductions in connection with his restaurant business that he
    operated in premises different than his residence.  </p>

    December 17, 2003, the CRA obtained a writ of execution in respect to amounts
    of GST he had failed to remit against the appellant’s entire real property.  On
    June 1,&nbsp;2004 the CRA registered a Notice of Lien against the appellant’s
    residence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    March 23, 2005, after the appellant had defaulted in his mortgage payments,
    the respondent commenced a typical mortgage action based on this default.  It
    was only after the respondent launched power of sale proceedings on April
    7, 2005 that it learned the appellant had failed to remit monies to the CRA
    and the registration of the writ of execution.  Shortly thereafter, the respondent
    communicated with the CRA and was advised that CRA’s lien on the appellant’s
    property had priority over the respondent’s mortgage.</p>

    May, 2005, pursuant to s.&nbsp;23 of the <i>Mortgages Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. M.&nbsp;40, the appellant tendered to the respondent the outstanding amount
    of principal and interest required to put his residential mortgage in good
    standing.  However, the respondent rejected the tender, claiming that before
    the mortgage could be
    “reinstated” the appellant also had to furnish proof that the amounts outstanding
    to the CRA had been paid in full and “have satisfied CRA’s claim”.  Had the
    respondent accepted the amount outstanding on the mortgage, the mortgage
    would have been put into good standing and its action against the appellant
    and its power of sale proceedings would have been terminated under s.&nbsp;23.

'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsequently,
    the respondent moved for summary judgment under Rule&nbsp;20 of <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i>.  As the ground for its motion, the respondent relied
    on an alleged default under the mortgage different than the default pleaded
    in its statement of claim.  Rather than relying on the appellant’s default
    in his mortgage payments, the respondent alleged that the mortgage was in
    default because of the appellant’s failure to remit monies to the CRA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    support of its motion for summary judgment, the respondent relied on the
    provisions of several pieces of federal tax legislation that, in essence,
    purportedly established CRA’s priority claim against all of the appellant’s
    real property to the extent of the amount owing to it on December&nbsp;5,&nbsp;2002
    when the appellant mortgaged his residence.  This was referred to before
    both the motion judge and this court as the CRA’s “super priority”.  Consequently,
    the respondent contended that it did not obtain a first charge on the appellant’s
    property upon registration of its mortgage because of the appellant’s prior
    failure to remit monies to the CRA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying
    on certain provisions of the standard charge terms of the mortgage, the respondent
    contended that its mortgage was in default at the moment it was registered.  In
    particular, the respondent relied on s.&nbsp;7(a)(1)(11) and s.&nbsp;9(a)(1).  Under
    s.&nbsp;7(a)(1), a borrower promises at all times to have good title to the
    land “free of all encumbrance and claims”.  Under s&nbsp;7(a)(11), a borrower
    promises the lender “to pay any money which, if not paid, <i>would result
    in a default under any charge or encumbrance having priority over this mortgage</i> which
    might result in the sale of the land if not paid” (emphasis added).  Section&nbsp;9(a)(1)
    provides that a default occurs under the mortgage if the borrower breaks
    any of its promises.  It was the respondent’s position that CRA’s writ of
    execution and Notice of Lien were charges or encumbrances within the meaning
    of s.&nbsp;7(a)(11) and that by allowing them to be registered on title,
    the appellant had broken a promise under s.&nbsp;9(a)(1).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    his interpretation of the tax legislation and ss.&nbsp;7 and 9 of the standard
    charge terms, the motion judge held that the appellant’s debt to the CRA
    in respect to his business resulted in a default of his obligations under
    his residential mortgage.  The default arose because the appellant was in
    breach of the promises found in s.&nbsp;7(a)(1) and (11) of the standard
    charge terms, with the result that the mortgage was in default under s.&nbsp;9(a)(1)
    of the standard charge terms.  He held that the money collected but not remitted
    by the appellant to the CRA in respect to his business was an
    “encumbrance” within the meaning to the standard charge terms contained in
    his residential mortgage.  In addition, the motion judge found that the appellant
    was in default at the inception of the mortgage.  He also found that the
    Notice of Lien registered on title was a “charge” or “encumbrance” as contemplated
    by the standard charge terms.  Consequently, the motion judge concluded that
    there was no genuine issue for trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that there was a genuine issue for trial as to whether
    the amounts he failed to remit to the CRA in operating his business constituted
    a default under his residential mortgage.  He contends that the standard
    charge terms are unclear in this regard.  He further contends that it cannot
    be said with reasonable certainty that the mortgage contract between the
    parties contemplated that a federal tax lien arising from the mortgagor’s
    business activity and totally unrelated to the mortgaged property was a “charge” or “encumbrance” within
    the meaning of the standard charge terms, particularly when the term “taxes”,
    as defined in the standard charge terms, relates to the usual realty taxes
    on the mortgaged property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view there is merit in the appellant’s submission that the interpretation
    of the standard charge terms constitutes a genuine issue for trial.  We were
    told that the issue of whether a mortgagor’s failure to remit GST payments
    and employee income tax deductions to the CRA in respect to his business
    operations results in a default of his residential mortgage is one of first
    instance.  In my view, it is an important issue for both borrowers and lenders.  A
    lender can find its security substantially diminished by the “super priority” status
    accorded to federal tax liens.  Should GST arrears
     or the Notice of Lien be considered as a
    “charge” or “encumbrance” within the meaning of the standard charge terms
    contained in a residential mortgage, a borrower will be in default under
    the mortgage when GST connected with  his business is unremitted with the
    result, under the acceleration clause in the mortgage, that the entire amount
    of principal and interest will become due and payable.  Given the importance
    and novelty of these issues, and in keeping with a long line of authority
    from this court, the issue should not have been determined at the pleading
    stage.  Rather, it should have been sent to trial to be decided on the basis
    of a complete record.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Spasic Estate v. Imperial Tobacco
    Ltd.</i> (2000), 188 D.L.R. (4th) 577 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ); leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused 196 D.L.R. (4th) vii.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge also rejected the appellant’s submission that there was a genuine
    issue for trial in respect to whether he had put the mortgage into good standing
    pursuant to s.&nbsp;23 of the <i>Mortgages Act</i> by tendering the amount
    due for principal and interest under the mortgage.  He held that to put the
    mortgage into good standing the appellant also had to pay the amount owing
    to the CRA.  The appellant points out that under s.&nbsp;23 default resulting
    in the service of notice of power of sale can be remedied at any time up
    to the sale of the property.  Given the clear language of s.&nbsp;23, the
    appellant submits that it was incorrectly interpreted and applied by the
    motion judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would also give effect to this ground of appeal.  At its highest, the appellant’s
    position is that the respondent was precluded from moving for summary judgment
    because it rejected his tender of the amount due under the mortgage.  The
    default pleaded in the respondent’s statement of claim &#9472; arrears in
    the monthly payments under the mortgage
    &#9472; was rectified by the appellant’s tender.  In the alternative, the
    appellant argued that the interpretation and application of s.&nbsp;23 of
    the <i>Mortgages Act</i> in the circumstances of this case raised a genuine
    issue for trial.  If the trial judge agrees with the appellant’s core argument,
    the respondent’s action would have terminated when the appellant tendered
    the amount due under the mortgage, with the result that there remained no
    claim before the court on which the respondent could seek summary judgment.  In
    my view, there was genuine issue for trial respecting the application and
    effect of s.&nbsp;23 of the Act in the circumstances of this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is a further issue that troubles me.  The appellant sought, and obtained,
    summary judgment on an issue that was not pleaded.  As I have stated, the
    respondent’s statement of claim is based on the appellant’s failure to make
    the payments due under the mortgage.  The motion judge was alert to this.  He
    indicated that while the respondent’s counsel did not know of the appellant’s
    outstanding tax payments when the statement of claim was prepared, counsel
    did not explain why the statement of claim was not amended.  After noting
    that the statement of claim should have been amended, the motion judge held:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, the appropriate disposition on this
    issue to grant leave to amend the statement of claim, <i>nunc pro tunc</i>,
    pursuant to Rule&nbsp;26.01, to avoid delay and further expense to the parties …”</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>Although he did not refer to the
    test under s. 26.01, presumably the motion judge was satisfied that the amendment
    did not prejudice the appellant.  In any event, before the case proceeds
    further, I would give the respondent leave to amend its pleadings.  The appellant
    may deliver an amended statement of defence, if so advised.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was some discussion before both the motion judge and this court in respect
    to whether the federal legislation creating the CRA’s
    “super priority” infringed on the province’s exclusive jurisdiction over
    property and civil rights.  In my view, it is open to the parties to now
    raise this issue upon notice of a constitutional question being given.  As
    well, serious consideration should be given to adding the CRA as a necessary
    party.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the foregoing reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of
    the motion judge and order that the action proceed to trial.  However, rather
    than proceeding to trial, if the parties agree, the issues in respect to
    which there is a genuine issue for trial may be resolved under the Rule&nbsp;22.01
    by way of a special case.  I would award the appellant his costs of the motion
    on a partial indemnity basis fixed at $7,500, inclusive of GST.  I would
    fix the costs of the appeal at $6,000, inclusive of GST, and order that they
    be awarded to the party that is successful at the trial or on the Rule&nbsp;22.01
    motion.</p>
