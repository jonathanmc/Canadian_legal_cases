      29(1)(a) requires some evidence of the existence of each element of the
      Canadian offence that parallels the offence on which extradition is sought.  That
      evidence must be such as would permit a reasonable jury, properly instructed,
      to convict on the parallel Canadian offence:  see <i>U.S.A. v. Ferras</i>, <i>supra</i>,
      at para. 38.  Prior to <i>U.S.A. v. </i><i>Ferras</i>, if that evidentiary
      threshold was crossed, the evidence proffered by the requesting state justified
      committal.  A qualitative assessment of the evidence relied on by the requesting
      state was beyond the scope of the s. 29(1)(a) inquiry.  The extradition
      judge could not weigh the evidence either by testing the credibility of
      the sources of that evidence or by examining the reliability of the evidence
      put forward by the requesting state:  see <i>United States of America v.
      Sheppard</i> (1976), 30 C.C.C. (2d) 424 (S.C.C.); <i>United States of America
      v. Shulman</i> (2001), 152 C.C.C. (3d) 294 at para. 59 (S.C.C.).  Consequently,
      evidence that could potentially affect the quality of the evidence proffered
      by the requesting state was irrelevant at the extradition hearing.  For
      example, on the law as it stood prior to <i>U.S.A. v. Ferras</i>, evidence
      that Lennox had a motive to falsely inculpate
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">

      39-40, that the principles of fundamental justice enshrined in s. 7 of

      required a judicial assessment of the evidence beyond a simple consideration
      of whether there was some evidence, regardless of its quality, to support
      the existence of each element of the parallel criminal offence.  Chief
      Justice McLachlin explained that since extradition proceedings could result
      in the removal of the person sought for extradition from
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place

      Canada</st1:country-region>

      example, at para. 54, McLachlin C.J.C. observes:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Challenging
    the justification for committal may involve adducing evidence or making arguments
    on whether the evidence could be believed by a reasonable jury.  Where such <u>evidence

    in a limited weighing of evidence to determine whether there is a plausible
    case.</u>  The ultimate assessment of reliability is still left for the trial
    where guilt and innocence are at issue.  However, the extradition judge looks
    at the whole of the evidence presented at the extradition hearing and determines
    whether it discloses a case on which a jury could convict.  If the evidence
    is so defective <u>or appears so unreliable that the judge concludes it would
    be dangerous or unsafe to convict, then the case should not go to a jury

    without requiring counsel for

    of the proposed evidence, before being allowed to call
    <st1:place w:st="on">

      any litigation where the admissibility of evidence is challenged, the presiding
      judge may require counsel to outline the nature of the anticipated evidence
      and demonstrate its admissibility based on that outline:  see e.g. <i>R.
      v. Truscott</i> (2006), 213 C.C.C. (3d) 183 at para. 19 (Ont.

    ).  Where the admissibility of the proffered evidence turns on its relevance,
    the presiding judge may determine relevance based on counsel’s outline of
    the anticipated evidence or the judge may hear the evidence and then rule
    on its relevance.  Policy considerations will determine which of those two
    courses should be followed.  </span></p>

      considerations shape the procedure to be followed where the admissibility
      of evidence is challenged.  In <i>R. v. Pires</i>; <i>R. v. Lising</i>,
      the accused challenged the admissibility of “wiretap” evidence.  In support
      of that challenge, they wanted to cross-examine the person who swore the
      affidavit in support of the “wiretap”
    authorization.  The accused argued that they should be entitled to cross-examine
    the affiant as of right.  The Crown argued, relying on <i>R. v. Garofoli</i> (1990),
    60 C.C.C. (3d) 161 (S.C.C.), that the accused could not cross-examine the
    affiant without first demonstrating that the proposed cross-examination would
    elicit testimony that was relevant to at least one of the preconditions to
    admissibility of the
    “wiretap” evidence.  </span></p>

      of cross-examination in the context of a criminal trial where an accused
      has the right to make full answer and defence.  She then said, at para.
      24:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>However, the
    accused’s right to an evidentiary hearing must be considered in context.  It

      J. stressed that in the context of an admissibility contest, evidence could
      be received only if that evidence could impact on the determination of
      the admissibility of the impugned evidence.  In other words, proffered
      evidence had to be relevant to the issue under consideration.  She said,
      at para. 31:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>There is no

      J. considered and rejected the argument that limits on cross-examination
      could adequately protect against irrelevant questioning.  She noted that “countervailing
      interests”, particularly the needs of preventing prolixity in criminal
      proceedings and protecting informants, could not be served by simply controlling
      cross-examination.  In respect of the first of these concerns, the prolixity
      of criminal proceedings, she opined, at para. 35:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The concern
    over the constructive use of judicial resources is as equally, if not more,
    applicable today as it was 15 years ago when <i>Garofoli</i> was decided.  For
    our justice system to operate, trial judges must have some ability to control
    the course of proceedings before them.  <u>One such mechanism is the power
    to decline to embark upon an evidentiary hearing at the request of one of
    the parties when that party is unable to show a reasonable likelihood that
    the hearing can assist in determining the issues before the court.</u>  [Emphasis

      think much of what was said in <i>R. v. Pires</i>; <i>R. v. Lising</i>, <i>supra</i>,
      has application to the present issue.  Extradition proceedings are intended

    ’s international obligations:  see <i>United States of America v. Dynar</i>,
    [1997] 2 S.C.R. 462 at para. 122.  The extradition hearing is neither a trial,
    nor even a precursor to a Canadian trial.  The guilt or innocence of the
    person whose extradition is sought is irrelevant in the extradition proceeding.  That
    proceeding has but one purpose – to ensure that the person is not extradited
    from
    <st1:place w:st="on">

      the requesting state and the need to maintain the essential nature and

      give evidence that could significantly undermine the reliability or credibility
      of the evidence relied on by the requesting state could be compelled to
      testify at the extradition hearing, I do not see how the extradition judge

        to call evidence at an extradition hearing that counsel claimed would
        demonstrate the unreliability of portions of the evidence relied on by
        the requesting state.  Trafford J. required counsel to outline the anticipated
        evidence before proceeding to hear that evidence.  He explained at para.
        14:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><u>In my view,
      the extradition judge may require the respondent in a hearing under s.
      29 of the Act to summarize the evidence to be called and its legal significance
      to the application before granting him an evidentiary hearing.</u>  The
      nature of the evidentiary hearing, if granted, is within the discretion
      of the hearing judge, subject to s. 32(1)c of the Act, as interpreted in <i>U.S.A.
      v. Ferras</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 53.  This will ensure the orderliness
      and fairness of the hearing, and prevent it from assuming the shape of
      a criminal trial.  Where the proffered evidence is admissible and is relevant
      to an issue to be determined by the extradition judge, such as the reliability
      of the evidence in the Record of the Case or its sufficiency, permission
      will be given to call the evidence.  However, where it is either inadmissible
      or irrelevant, such permission will not be given by the Court.  The respondent
      is not entitled to call evidence that is inadmissible.  Nor is he entitled
      to call evidence that is irrelevant to an issue in the hearing.  The essential
      fairness of the hearing is not diminished by such a ruling by the extradition
      judge.  It is also compatible with the narrow jurisdiction of the Court,
      as described in <i>U.S.A. v. Ferras</i>, <i>supra</i>. …  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The notion of
    manifest unreliability articulated by the Court in <i>U.S.A. v. Ferras</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    in para. 40 requires a body of evidence that directly undermines the reliability
    of the evidence in the record of the case presented by the requesting state.  The
    calling of the defence, as it would be at trial, is not what is contemplated
    under <i>U.S.A. v. Ferras</i>, <i>supra</i>.  In this case, the proffered
    evidence is not relevant to the reliability of the evidence contained in
    the record of the case, or its sufficiency.  Rather, it merely amounts to
    another interpretation of the conversation to which he admits he was a party,
    denies being a party to the other incriminating conversations and leaves,
    unchallenged, the evidence of the monitors and interpreters.  Accordingly,
    the request for permission to call it was denied.</p>

      the expanded inquiry on committal dictated by <i>U.S.A. v. </i><i>Ferras</i>, <i>supra</i>, and
