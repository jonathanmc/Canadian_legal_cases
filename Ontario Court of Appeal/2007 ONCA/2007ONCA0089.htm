  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Beau
    McDonald-Wright was born on December 25, 2000, with a rare congenital abnormality
    known as “frontal encephalocele,” a neural tube defect.  Audrey&nbsp;McDonald
    is Beau’s mother.  She was referred to the respondent, Med-Scan Ultrasound
    Services Ltd., by her family doctor for a second trimester fetal ultrasound
    on September&nbsp;18,&nbsp;2000.  Menotti Mazzuca is an ultrasound technician
    and the owner of Med-Scan.  He performed the ultrasound on Ms.&nbsp;McDonald.  He
    took a series of still images that he provided to the respondent, Dr.&nbsp;Patrick
    O’Herlihy, along with a completed worksheet on which he had recorded his
    observations.  Dr.&nbsp;O’Herlihy is a radiologist with over twenty years’ experience.  He
    had worked with Mr.&nbsp;Mazzuca, who had been a medical doctor in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Italy</st1:country-region>
    , for more than thirteen years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    primary liability issue at trial was whether the performance of the fetal
    ultrasound study by Mr.&nbsp;Mazzuca, and its interpretation by Dr.&nbsp;O’Herlihy,
    fell below the standard of care applicable to each of them at the relevant
    time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to a “wrongful birth” claim by the mother, the appellants brought
    a “wrongful life” claim on behalf of the fetus.  The
    “wrongful birth” claim was not controversial.  However, at the opening of
    trial, the respondents brought a Rule 21 motion to strike the “wrongful life” claim.  The
    trial judge dismissed the motion and allowed the claim to proceed to trial
    so that it could be decided on the basis of a full factual record. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jury was never instructed on the two claims because the trial judge conducted
    the trial on the understanding that the underlying legal differences between
    the claims were relevant only to damages.  In the end, because of the jury
    verdict of no negligence on the part of either Dr.&nbsp;O’Herlihy or Mr.&nbsp;Mazzuca,
    the trial judge held that the legal questions surrounding a “wrongful life” claim
    were moot and did not warrant determination as they would have no practical
    effect.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly
    after the trial commenced, Mr. Mazzuca brought a motion to discharge the
    jury on the ground of complexity.  The appellants supported the motion; Dr.&nbsp;O’Herlihy
    opposed it.  The trial judge reserved on the motion on the basis of prematurity.  The
    trial proceeded to completion and, following the jury’s verdict, the trial
    judge released reasons in which she dismissed the motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    factual issue arose during the trial.  Mr.&nbsp;Mazzuca testified that he
    left the examination room during the course of performing the fetal ultrasound
    in order to consult with Dr.&nbsp;O’Herlihy about his suspicion of an abnormality
    of the fetal face.  He said that Dr.&nbsp;O’Herlihy instructed him simply
    to complete the examination.  Dr.&nbsp;O’Herlihy testified that no such conversation
    occurred.  The appellants’
    counsel cross-examined Dr.&nbsp;O’Herlihy on his OHIP billing in relation
    to the ultrasound, putting it to Dr.&nbsp;O’Herlihy that he had in fact billed
    for an appointment during which he had “participated” in the appellant mother’s
    examination.  Dr.&nbsp;O’Herlihy’s trial counsel objected, at the end of
    his examination, on the ground that the records had not been produced and,
    as they were not privileged, could not be used as of right to impeach credibility.  The
    trial judge instructed the jury to disregard this evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants argue that the trial amounted to a miscarriage of justice because
    the trial judge failed to render reasons in a timely manner with respect
    to the motion to strike the jury and failed to ensure that the wrongful life
    claim was adjudicated.  They also argue that the trial judge erred in excluding
    evidence of the OHIP billing.  Consequently, they say that the jury verdict
    must be set aside and a finding of negligence against some or all of the
    respondents substituted or a new trial ordered.  </p>

        the Jury</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion to strike the jury was argued on the first morning of trial.  On considering
    the motion, the trial judge was of the view that, in accordance with authority,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> the appropriate way to proceed was to reserve
    on the motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the jury rendered its verdict, the trial judge issued reasons that addressed
    a number of matters, including the motion.  She explained that she initially
    reserved because, when the motion was brought at the commencement of trial,
    she did not know whether the assessment of damages would be factually complex
    as well as legally complex.   Nor did she know whether the medical evidence
    would be too difficult for the jury.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her reasons for refusing to discharge the jury, the trial judge began by
    reviewing the applicable legal principles.  She noted that this court has
    made it clear that a trial judge must have substantial reasons to displace
    a litigant’s <i>prima facie </i>right to trial by jury.  Further, although
    a trial judge has a wide discretion on a motion to strike a jury notice,
    the moving party has a substantial onus because trial by jury is a fundamental
    right.  See <i>Hunt (Litigation guardian of) v. Sutton Group Incentive Realty
    Inc. </i>(2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 665 ) (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge explained her assessment of the medical and other evidence and
    stated that as the evidence unfolded, it did not appear to be very different
    from the kind of evidence commonly dealt with by civil juries in medical
    and personal injury cases.  She was “confident” that the jury, properly instructed,
    was in as good a position as she to decide the factual issues and that none
    of the evidence was beyond the jury’s comprehension.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also considered the character of the jury and concluded that
    the jurors were dedicated, took their responsibilities seriously and had
    the benefit of experienced counsel who knew their cases thoroughly and were
    exceptionally skilled at presenting evidence before a jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    see no error in the approach followed by the trial judge.  On the contrary,
    this approach conforms with the guidance of this court in <i>Migos</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    and served the interests of justice.  Nor do I see any error in the legal
    principles articulated by the trial judge or their application.  Her reasons
    are a model of clarity and demonstrate that she fully and fairly considered
    the applicable legal principles and competing considerations in respect of
    all of the parties.     </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>             </span><span lang=EN-US>The “wrongful

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Similarly,
      I see no error in the way in which the trial judge dealt with the issues
      surrounding the “wrongful life” claim.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge concluded that liability questions could be put to the jury
      and fairly determined by them without instruction on “wrongful life”.  Even
      if the appellants’ trial counsel misunderstood how the trial judge intended
      to proceed, as was alleged before this court, there was no error or miscarriage
      of justice.  The respondents owed the same duty of care and were held to
      the same standard of care in respect of the appellant mother and the fetus.  The
      jury’s task was to resolve the factual elements common to both causes of
      action.  Its determinations were conclusive of liability, causation and
      the assessment of damages in both causes of action.  In light of the manner
      in which the appellants’ case was put to the jury, there can be no question
      but that the jury was fully aware of the existence of the infant appellant’s
      claim.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      the circumstances, I see no error in the trial judge permitting the jury
      to determine the allegations of negligence without instruction on the legal
      differences between a “wrongful life” and a “wrongful death” claim.  Nor
      do I see any basis for interfering with the trial judge’s determination
      that, given the jury verdicts, the legal issues were rendered moot.  </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Exclusion of the OHIP Billing</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      see no error in the trial judge’s ruling on this matter.  Dr.&nbsp;O’Herlihy
      did not prepare or submit the OHIP billing.  As the evidence on the record
      is that the clinic performed those functions, I see no basis on which to
      view the billing as a prior statement by Dr.&nbsp;O’Herlihy.  Thus, it
      is difficult to see how the apparently erroneous billing could be used
      to impeach Dr. O’Herlihy.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further,
      Dr. O’Herlihy testified that he could not recall whether he was in the
      clinic on the day in question.  Even assuming that Dr. O’Herlihy was aware
      of the specific OHIP code that had been billed, the OHIP bill does not
      contradict his evidence concerning whether he was at the clinic on the
      day on which the ultrasound was performed.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally,
      neither Mr.&nbsp;Mazzuca nor Dr.&nbsp;O’Herlihy testified that Dr.&nbsp;O’Herlihy
      performed some of the procedure or reviewed any of the images before the
      appellant mother left.  The OHIP billing code in question covers the situation
      where the radiologist is present in the clinic during the examination and
      does one of these activities, that is, either performs some of the procedure
      or reviews the images before the patient leaves the clinic.  As the evidence
      of the OHIP billing supports neither Mr.&nbsp;Mazzuca’s nor Dr.&nbsp;O’Herlihy’s
      version of events, it is irrelevant to the credibility dispute between
      them.  </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>It
      is not completely clear whether the appellants argue also that the jury
      verdict was perverse.  To the extent that they argue that, in light of
      Mr.&nbsp;Mazzuca’s evidence, the verdict is unreasonable because it found
      none of the respondents liable, I disagree.  It was clearly open to the
      jury to reject Mr.&nbsp;Mazzuca’s evidence that he identified a suspected
      abnormality in the fetal face.  Moreover, there is ample evidence on the
      record to support the jury verdict.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly,
      the appeal is dismissed with costs, if demanded, to Dr.&nbsp;O’Herlihy
      fixed at $20,000 and to Med-Scan and Mr.&nbsp;Mazzuca fixed at $1,200,
