  <h4><span lang=EN-US>PARDU J. (<i>Ad hoc</i>):</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeals against convictions were abandoned.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants seek leave to appeal their sentences of 7 years, 6 months for
    aggravated assault, assault with a weapon, and failure to comply with a recognizance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They
    argue that the trial judge did not give sufficient weight to their status
    as youthful offenders.  After credit for 24½ months of pre-sentence custody
    on a two for one basis, the sentence amounted to 41 months.  The appellants
    argue that 10 to 23 additional months, perhaps accompanied by probation for
    the maximum of 3 years, would have been sufficient.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants and one other attacked the victim with machetes, for no apparent
    reason.  The victim who appears to have been selected at random was standing
    with friends near his high school.  He tried to flee into the school but
    the doors were locked.  He was knocked to the ground and while prone and
    helpless, was slashed some twenty-one times with the machetes, leaving him
    with serious, life-altering physical and psychological injuries.  The jury
    acquitted the appellants of attempted murder, but convicted them of aggravated
    assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentence imposed was close to the upper range of sentences imposed for this
    kind of offence.  The appellants argue that sentences in the highest range
    have been imposed where the victim has been left in a vegetative state or
    wholly dependant on others and that this is not that kind of case.  That
    the victim in this case did not suffer even more catastrophic injuries is
    not attributable to any restraint or care on the part of the offenders and
    does not materially reduce the culpability of their actions</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants were both 20 years old at the time of the offence and 22 years
    old at the date of sentencing.  They had good employment records and had
    the support of family and friends.  They argue that the sentencing judge
    did not pay sufficient heed to the long-standing principle that youthful
    offenders should not be sentenced to imprisonment if some other sentence
    could be imposed, and that if jail is required, it should be as short as
    possible.  The weight given to this factor is attenuated in serious violent
    crimes.  It is reasonable to infer that an offender who violently attacks
    another, for no apparent reason, and commits that offence in concert with
    two other persons, all armed with machetes constitutes a danger to the community.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    reasons of the trial judge were thorough and do not reflect any failure to
    consider a relevant principle.  He noted, at paragraphs 63 to 65:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[63] The circumstances of this case make rehabilitation
    of youthful first-time (leaving aside the relatively minor previous theft
    conviction of Mr. Kanthasamy) offenders, together with denunciation of the
    offenders’ unlawful conduct, specific deterrence and general deterrence,
    primary objectives of the sentence to be imposed.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[64] The mitigating factor is the young age of
    the offenders. They are reasonably well educated, have work histories and
    can be productive members of society.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[65] The objectives of denunciation of unlawful
    conduct, and specific and general deterrence must be balanced with the objective
    of rehabilitation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted in <i>R. v. Shropshire</i> (1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at paragraph
    46:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>An appellate court should not be given free reign
    to modify a sentencing order simply because it feels that a different order
    ought to have been made.  The formulation of a sentencing order is a profoundly
    subjective process; the trial judge had the advantage of having seen and
    heard all of the witnesses whereas the appellate court can only base itself
    upon a written record.  A variation in the sentence should only be made if
    the Court of Appeal is convinced it is not fit.  That is to say, that it
    has found the sentence to be clearly unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>At paragraph 50:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Unreasonableness in the sentencing process involves
    the sentencing order falling outside the “acceptable range” of orders; …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly
    in <i>R. v. M.(
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    )</i> (1996), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 327 (S.C.C.) at paragraphs 90 and 91:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[90] Put simply, absent an error in principle,
    failure to consider a relevant factor, or an overemphasis of the appropriate
    factors, a court of appeal should only intervene to vary a sentence imposed
    at trial if the sentence is demonstrably unfit.  Parliament explicitly vested
    sentencing judges with a <u>discretion</u> to determine the appropriate degree
    and kind of punishment under the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  As s. 717(1) reads:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><b>717.</b> (1) Where an enactment prescribes
    different degrees or kinds of punishment in respect of an offence, the punishment
    to be imposed is, subject to the limitations prescribed in the enactment,
    in the <u>discretion</u> of the court that convicts the person who commits
    the offence.&nbsp; [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[91] This deferential standard of review has profound
    functional justifications.  As Iacobucci J. explained in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Shropshire</i>, at para. 46, where the sentencing judge has had the benefit
    of presiding over the trial of the offender, he or she will have had the
    comparative advantage of having seen and heard the witnesses to the crime.  But
    in the absence of a full trial, where the offender has pleaded guilty to
    an offence and the sentencing judge has only enjoyed the benefit of oral
    and written sentencing submissions (as was the case in both <i>Shropshire</i> and
    this instance), the argument in favour of deference remains compelling.  A
    sentencing judge still enjoys a position of advantage over an appellate judge
    in being able to directly assess the sentencing submissions of both the Crown
    and the offender.  A sentencing judge also possesses the unique qualifications
    of experience and judgment from having served on the front lines of our criminal
    justice system.  Perhaps most importantly, the sentencing judge will normally
    preside near or within the community which has suffered the consequences
    of the offender's crime.  As such, the sentencing judge will have a strong
    sense of the particular blend of sentencing goals that will be “just and
    appropriate” for the protection of that community.  The determination of
    a just and appropriate sentence is a delicate art which attempts to balance
    carefully the societal goals of sentencing against the moral blameworthiness
    of the offender and the circumstances of the offence, while at all times
    taking into account the needs and current conditions of and in the community.  The
    discretion of a sentencing judge should thus not be interfered with lightly</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, we are not satisfied that the sentence imposed was “demonstrably
    unfit” nor that the sentence imposed was a
    “substantial and marked departure from the sentences customarily imposed
    for similar offenders committing similar crimes”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the trial judge could have imposed a sentence which would have kept the appellants
    in the provincial correctional system and allowed for a lengthy period of
    probation after their release, we are not persuaded that he erred in the
    blend of sentencing goals he viewed as just and appropriate for the protection
    of the community.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is also argued that the trial judge erred in failing to give a three for
    one credit for two periods of pre-trial custody totalling 5 months during
    which the institution suffered overcrowding, several lockdowns and reduced
    programs.  The trial judge did not err in refusing enhanced credit for this
    time.  While there was evidence about the general conditions in the institution
    during the time the appellants were there, there was no evidence about the
    particular situation of the appellants.  The trial judge reviewed the relevant
    authorities and refused to exercise his discretion in favour of a greater
    credit.  He did not err in assessing the pre-trial custody on a global basis,
    and determining that a two for one credit on the entire period of pre-trial
    custody was adequate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    leave to appeal sentence is granted but the appeals are dismissed.</p>
