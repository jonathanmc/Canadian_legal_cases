    moved for the determination of whether Ryan&nbsp;P. was insured under his
    mother’s home insurance policy with CU and/or under his aunt and uncle’s
    home insurance policy with Wawanesa.  The motion judge found that Ryan&nbsp;P.
    was insured under the Wawanesa insurance policy, but not under the CU policy.  She
    further held that an exclusion clause in the Wawanesa policy did not apply.  Wawanesa
    appeals on the ground that the motion judge erred in finding that Ryan&nbsp;P.
    was insured by his aunt and uncle’s homeowner policy, and that she further
    erred in failing to apply the exclusion clause.  Wawanesa seeks leave to
    appeal that part of the motion judge’s costs order requiring that it pay
    the costs of its co&#8209;defendant CU, fixed in the amount of approximately
    $32,000 (the “Sanderson order”).  Ryan&nbsp;E. appeals from the motion judge’s
    finding that Ryan&nbsp;P. was not insured under his mother’s CU policy.  For
    the reasons that follow, I would allow Wawanesa’s appeal and dismiss Ryan&nbsp;E.’s
    appeal.</p>

    a narrow one, whether criminal negligence causing bodily harm is a “criminal
    act”
    within the meaning of the exclusion clause.  The motion judge found that
    it was not, and held that the exclusion clause did not preclude Ryan&nbsp;E.

    parents were divorced.  He was three years old when his parents separated
    in 1986.  He lived with his mother, who had custody of him, from 1986 until
    December 1997 when, as a result of conflicts with his step&#8209;father,
    he decided to live with his father.  Since moving in with his father, Ryan&nbsp;P.
    did not live with his mother.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior
    to the shooting incident that occurred on June&nbsp;12,&nbsp;1998, Ryan&nbsp;P.
    was living in his father’s home.  He was fifteen years old, and he had behavioural
    problems.  For example, he was frequently absent from school, grew marijuana
    plants in his room and played with his father’s guns and ammunition.  Around
    the beginning of June, Ryan&nbsp;P.’s father was compelled to enter a residential
    facility for treatment for substance abuse.  As Ryan&nbsp;P. did not want
    to live with his mother during his father’s absence, arrangements were made
    for him to live in the home of his aunt and uncle, John and Catherine Prystay.  It
    was believed that he would live with his relatives for three weeks while
    his father underwent treatment.  He had been living with them for ten days
    before the shooting.  When he moved into the residential facility, Ryan&nbsp;P.’s
    father locked his house and instructed his son that he was not to go there.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the shooting incident, contrary to his father’s instructions that he
    was not to enter the house, Ryan&nbsp;P. broke into it with Ryan&nbsp;E.
    and another friend.  In para.&nbsp;25 of her reasons for judgment, the motion
    judge gave the following account of what occurred:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Initially, the plaintiff [Ryan&nbsp;E.] pointed
    a rifle at Ryan P., then put it down.  Ryan P. picked up a shotgun, showed
    the other boys that it was loaded, and pointed it at the plaintiff.  He backed
    up against the wall, and the gun accidentally discharged at short range,
    striking the plaintiff in the abdomen with bird shot.  The plaintiff received
    permanent and serious injuries.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>After the shooting, Ryan&nbsp;P.
    went to live in his mother’s home.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'>IV</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge first determined whether Ryan&nbsp;P. was insured under his
    aunt and uncle’s policy with Wawanesa or his mother’s policy with CU.  His
    father was uninsured.  This determination required a finding that at the
    relevant time Ryan&nbsp;P. was “living in the same household” as the named
    insured, that he was a relative of the named insured or that he was under
    the age of twenty&#8209;one and in the care of the named insured.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    a lengthy review of authorities, the motion judge resolved the coverage issue
    by finding that Ryan&nbsp;P. was insured under his aunt and uncle’s Wawanesa
    policy, and not under his mother’s CU policy.  The motion judge’s finding
    in respect to coverage under the Wawanesa policy is found in paras.&nbsp;46&#8209;49:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I find that Ryan P. was a member of the household
    of his aunt and uncle, Catherine Prystay and John Prystay, albeit on a temporary
    basis.  He falls within the definition of a member of the household of the
    insured.  He is also a person under the age of 21 in the care of the insured.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>When he was with his aunt and uncle, he was not
    a part of any other functioning household.  His aunt and uncle took him in
    because he was their nephew.  He was connected to them by familial bonds.  They
    felt an affinity with him by virtue of that bond.  He was not merely a boarder.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Ryan&nbsp;P.’s aunt and uncle recognized that Ryan&nbsp;P.
    would not merely occupy space in their home, as a boarder, but that he would
    require care.  He was a young person who required guidance, encouragement
    and supervision, which the Prystays provided.  They insisted he go to school
    and even drove him.  They did not let him smoke in the house.  They imposed
    a curfew.  They gave him direction and attempted to impose discipline.  They
    tried to prevent him from going alone to his father’s vacant home.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Ryan&nbsp;P.’s aunt and uncle took responsibility
    for him.  “Responsibility” is the term Catherine Prystay used when she expressed
    her reluctance to care for Ryan&nbsp;P., given her other family obligations.  It
    was clear to her that Ryan&nbsp;P. would not be a mere boarder.  The Prystays
    cared about Ryan&nbsp;P. and tried to do what was best for him.  Their assumption
    of responsibility was recognized by both the trial judge and the Court of
    Appeal who found that the aunt and uncle did all they could for Ryan&nbsp;P…  They
    were accordingly absolved from liability for the plaintiff’s injuries.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge found that Ryan&nbsp;P. was not insured under his mother’s CU
    policy because he was not a member of his mother’s household at the time
    of Ryan&nbsp;E.’s injuries.  Her primary reasons for this finding are found
    in paras.&nbsp;52-53:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>With respect, I do not accept this submission.  The
    trial court and the Court of Appeal found that the mother delegated Ryan&nbsp;P.’s
    care to others.  The evidence was that the boy was estranged from his mother
    at the time he elected to stay with his father, and that they had little
    contact.  He cut ties with her 6 months prior to the shooting.  He kept secrets
    from her, knowing she would intervene if she knew he was playing with guns.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>When Ryan&nbsp;P.’s father undertook alcohol treatment,
    Ryan&nbsp;P. did not return to his mother’s home.  While it is true that
    Ryan&nbsp;P. returned to her residence after the shooting, there is no evidence
    he intended to return before this event, despite her wish that he do so.  While
    at his father’s home, and even when at the home of his aunt and uncle, a
    few doors away from his mother, Ryan&nbsp;P. did not visit his mother; he
    did not return for weekends.  There is not even evidence of telephone contact.  At
    no time in the 6 months prior to the shooting was he physically present in
    his mother’s home.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'>V</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    found that Ryan&nbsp;P. was covered by his aunt and uncle’s insurance policy,
    the motion judge turned to whether coverage was excluded because Ryan&nbsp;E.’s
    bodily injury was “caused by any intentional or criminal act” on the part
    of Ryan&nbsp;P.  She noted that the identical exclusion clause is found in
    both the Wawanesa and CU policies.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    noting that Ryan&nbsp;P. had pleaded guilty to, and was convicted of, criminal
    negligence causing bodily harm as a result of the shooting, the motion judge
    stated that s.&nbsp;118 of the <i>Insurance Act</i> limits the scope of an
    exclusion where an insured has engaged in criminal behaviour.  Section&nbsp;118
    reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Unless the contract otherwise provides, a contravention
      of any criminal or other law in force in Ontario or elsewhere</i> does
      not, by that fact alone, render unenforceable a claim for indemnity under
      a contract of insurance <i>except where the contravention is committed
      by the insured</i> or by another person with the consent of the insured, <i>with
      intent to bring about loss or damage</i>, but in the case of a contract
      of life insurance this section applies only to disability insurance undertaken
      as part of the contract. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    paras.&nbsp;70&#8209;84 the motion judge engaged in a lengthy discussion
    of two Supreme Court of Canada decisions, <i>Non&#8209;Marine Underwriters,
    Lloyds of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    London v. Scalera</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 551 and <i>Co&#8209;operative Fire &amp;
    Casualty Co. v. Saindon</i>, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 735, together with a number
    of related cases.  In <i>Scalera</i>, as in this case, the insurance policy
    excluded “bodily injury … caused by any intentional or criminal act”.  In <i>Saindon</i>,
    the exclusion applied to “bodily injury caused intentionally by … an insured”.  In
    neither case did the Supreme Court consider whether the act of the insured
    that caused the bodily injury was excluded from coverage because it was a
    criminal act.  In each case, the Supreme Court only considered the intentional
    act exclusion.  In<i> Scalera</i>, the court held that for the intentional
    act exclusion to apply it is required that the insured possess the intent
    not only to do the act, but also, in doing the act, the intent to injure.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    a consideration of the application of the criminal act exclusion, the motion
    judge returned to the intentional act exclusion in para.&nbsp;102 where she
    reached the conclusion that it had no application in the circumstances of
    this case:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Applying the test in <i>Scalera, </i>the insurers
    must demonstrate an intentional act plus an intent to injure in order to
    trigger the exclusion clause.  On the facts of the case at bar, they cannot
    do so.  Pointing the firearm at the plaintiff was intentional, but the discharge
    of the gun was accidental.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is to be noted that Wawanesa’s principal argument before the motion judge
    and this court was not that the intentional act exclusion applied.  Rather,
    it was, on the facts of this case, that the criminal act exclusion clearly
    applied because Ryan&nbsp;P. had been convicted of criminal negligence causing
    bodily harm arising from his shooting of Ryan&nbsp;E.  In para.&nbsp;85,
    the motion judge rejected this submission:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Ryan&nbsp;P.’s conviction for criminal negligence
    is not a criminal act that is caught by the exclusion clause.  Criminal negligence
    is a subset of negligence.  It is included in the <a
name=reflex-statute-7757093><i>Criminal Code</i></a> because Parliament has enlarged
    criminal responsibility beyond intentional conduct.  The <i>mens rea</i> for
    criminal negligence is recklessness as defined in section 219 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  This is qualitatively different than the <i>mens rea</i> for intention: <i>Devlin
    v. Co-operative Fire and Casualty Co., </i><a
name=reflex-caselaw-17812397></a>[1978] A.J. No. 682 (Alta S.C. A.D.).&nbsp; Ryan&nbsp;P.’s
    criminal negligence is the very type of conduct that is contemplated by s.
    118 of the <i>Insurance Act</i>.</p>

    s. 118 of the <i>Insurance Act</i> has already codified the policy of the

    contends that the motion judge erred in finding that Ryan&nbsp;P. was insured
    by its contract of insurance with his aunt and uncle and that coverage for
    Ryan&nbsp;P.’s wounding of Ryan&nbsp;E. was not excluded by the criminal
    act exclusion.  I would not give effect to Wawanesa’s first ground of appeal
    as in my view it was open to the motion judge on the evidence to find that
    Ryan&nbsp;P. was covered by his aunt and uncle’s insurance policy.  Ryan&nbsp;P.
    was more than a transient house guest.  The motion judge concluded that he
    was “living in the same household” with his aunt and uncle.  I see no reason
    to interfere with this finding.  As well, I would not give effect to Ryan&nbsp;E.’s
    appeal that the motion judge erred in finding that Ryan&nbsp;P. was not covered
    by his mother’s insurance policy with CU.  On the evidence it was open to
    the motion judge to come to this finding.  However, I would give effect to
    Wawanesa’s second ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge held that Ryan&nbsp;P.’s conviction for criminal negligence
    did not constitute a criminal act that was “caught by the exclusion clause”.  I
    am unable to agree with her conclusion.  As I understand her reasons, I am
    also unable to agree with the motion judge’s conclusion, on the basis of
    s.&nbsp;118 of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, that Ryan&nbsp;E. was not precluded
    from recovering under Wawanesa’s policy because Ryan&nbsp;P.’s contravention
    of the criminal law was not intended to cause loss or damage.  In other words,
    the trial judge was incorrect in interpreting s.&nbsp;118 as a limitation
    on the criminal act exclusion in Wawanesa’s policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Wawanesa policy provided the insured with broad coverage for damages arising
    from any bodily injury or property damage arising out of his personal activities
    anywhere in the world, except where such damages are caused by an intentional
    act or by a criminal act.  In <i>Scott v. Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Co.</i>,
    [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1445 at 1465, on behalf of the majority of the court, L’Heureux&#8209;Dubé&nbsp;J.
    characterized a similar exclusion as “perfectly clear and unambiguous”.  Indeed,
    Canadian courts have not discerned any ambiguity in the “criminal act” exclusion
    in this policy, or in similar exclusions.  In this case, the policy of insurance
    excludes liability of the insurer for damages caused by intentional or criminal
    acts of the insured.  I do not see how the insurer could have worded its
    policy to exclude the risk of damage caused by a criminal act other than
    by the precise terms used in its policy.  It is undisputed that Ryan&nbsp;E.’s
    injury was caused by Ryan&nbsp;P.’s criminal act.  He acknowledged committing
    the criminal act by pleading guilty to, and being convicted of, criminal
    negligence causing bodily harm.  I appreciate that the result of this appeal
    may appear to be harsh.  However, where the language of a contract is unambiguous,
    as in my view it is in this case, courts should not give it a meaning different
    from that expressed in clear language, unless the contract is unreasonable
    or is contrary to the intention of the parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    language of the exclusion is disjunctive.  An act of an insured that causes
    injury is excluded when it is either an intentional act, or a criminal act.  In <i>Buttar
    v. Safeco Insurance Co. of America</i> (1986), 30 D.L.R. (4th) 762 (B.C.S.C.),
    the insured, who had been convicted of arson, contended that the criminal
    act exclusion did not apply because, although he intended to set fire to
    clothing and blankets, he had no intention of causing a fire to his house.  In
    rejecting this submission, MacKinnon J. stated at p.&nbsp;765:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In any event there is no authority for the proposition
    that the exclusionary clause in the policy is to be read as if
    “criminal act” applies only to criminal offences carried out with the intent
    of causing the loss.  The exclusionary clause is not so worded.  It does
    exclude <i>criminal</i> acts <i>causing</i> the loss.  There is no ambiguity
    or uncertainty in the language used.  Criminal acts causing the loss are
    excluded.  In addition wilful acts causing the loss are excluded.  [Emphasis
    in original.]</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>I would adopt the comments of MacKinnon&nbsp;J.
    and apply them to the circumstances of this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge’s interpretation of “criminal act” as applying only to criminal
    acts intended to cause injury renders the phrase
    “criminal act” superfluous.  An insurer intending to exclude only criminal
    acts where the insured intends to cause injury could achieve the same result
    by merely excluding intentionally caused injuries.  It is a well established
    principle that insurance contracts should not be interpreted to render their
    terms meaningless.  Moreover, contrary to the view of the motion judge, the
    criminal act exclusion does not exempt certain categories of crime, or specific
    crimes.  In my view, in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    the phrase “criminal act”
    means any breach of the <i>Criminal Code</i> because s.&nbsp;9 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> abolishes all common law crimes, with the exception of the common
    law power of judges to punish for contempt of court.  Since the Wawanesa
    policy covers the activities of those insured by it anywhere in the world,
    the insurer could not have reasonably restricted the definition of “criminal
    act” to breaches of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, I do not agree with the motion judge that the language of s.&nbsp;118
    of the <i>Insurance Act</i> affects that interpretation of insurance policies.  As
    explained in <i>Oldfield v. Transamerica Life Insurance Co. of Canada</i>,
    [2002] 1 S.C.R. 742 at paras.&nbsp;32&#8209;38, the predecessor to s.&nbsp;118
    was enacted in 1948 to modify the common law rule that indemnification for
    loss for damage caused by the contravention of the criminal law or other
    statute is contrary to public policy, even if the insurance contract provides
    for indemnification in such circumstances.  Although the motion judge was
    correct in stating that Ryan&nbsp;P.’s criminal negligence was the type of
    conduct contemplated by s.&nbsp;118, she failed to consider the opening phrase
    of that section: “Unless the contract otherwise provides”.  This language
    permits liability insurers, as Wawanesa has done in this case, to exclude
    indemnification for loss or damages caused by contravention of the criminal
    law, or other statute, regardless of the intent, or lack of intent, to cause
    loss or damage by the commission of an illegal act.  In other words, s.&nbsp;118
    does not apply to Wawanesa’s insurance contract because it “otherwise provides” that
    damages caused by a criminal act of the insured are excluded from coverage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, Southey&nbsp;J. correctly explained the meaning of predecessor to
    s.&nbsp;118 in <i>Kolta v. State Farm Fire &amp;
    Casualty Co.</i> (1981), 32 O.R. (2d) 515 (H.C.J.).  In this case, the defendant’s
    liability policy contained a criminal act exclusion.  Damage caused to the
    insured’s house was caused by his criminal act.  In seeking to obtain indemnity
    for the damage that he caused to his house, the insured relied on s.&nbsp;92
    of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1970, c.&nbsp;224, which contains language
    substantially the same as s.&nbsp;118 of the present Act, to obtain indemnification.  In
    rejecting this argument, at p.&nbsp;520 Southey&nbsp;J. stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>That section has no application to the present
    case, in my view, because of the introductory words: “Unless the contract
    otherwise provides”.  In this case the contract of insurance in exclusion
    (g) expressly provides that coverage will be excluded where loss or damage
    is caused by a criminal or wilful act of the insured.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the law on the criminal act exclusion is correctly stated in the
    following passages in C. Brown, <i>Insurance Law in Canada</i>, looseleaf,
    4th ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 2002), at 18&#8209;181 to 18&#8209;182:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Some policies exclude claims arising from injury
    or damage “caused by any intentional <i>or criminal act</i> or failure by
    any person insured by this policy”.  It is a necessary requirement under
    such policy wording that the criminal act caused the loss.  If it did not,
    the exclusion will not apply.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The exclusion applies even without proof of intention
    to cause the injury or damage, so long as the act or omission that causes
    the harm is criminal in nature.  This is especially important in certain
    criminal offences where <i>mens rea</i> or criminal intent is not an element
    of the offence, <i>such as criminal negligence</i>, and of certain criminal
    failures to act, such as failure to provide the necessaries of life and neglect
    to obtain assistance in child&#8209;birth.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A criminal conviction is not required by the exclusion.  If
    there is a conviction, it is <i>prima facie</i> proof of the fact.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . . .
    .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The exclusion applies to injury “caused by any
    intentional <i>or</i> criminal act”.  A number of courts have held that this
    exclusion is clear and unambiguous.  Intention is not a required element
    of the criminal act for at least two reasons.  First, the word “or” is disjunctive:
    the word “intentional” does not modify “criminal”.  The second reason is
    even more compelling.  If the criminal act has to be intentional, there would
    be no need to include the “criminal act” wording.  The intentional act portion
    of the exclusion would apply, and the “criminal act wording would be rendered
    superfluous.  An insurance contract is not to be interpreted so as to render
    terms meaningless.                                          [Emphasis added.]</p>

    would grant Wawanesa leave to appeal from the Sanderson order that required
    it to pay the costs of its co&#8209;defendant, CU.  In my view, where an

    the successful defendant, a Sanderson order is unfair and constitutes an
    error in principle.  See <i>Rooney (Litigation Guardian of) v. Graham</i> (2001),
