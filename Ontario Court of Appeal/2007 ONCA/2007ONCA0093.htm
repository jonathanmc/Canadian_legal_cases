  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Saliba raises two issues on his appeal: first, the trial judge erred in her
    interpretation of paragraph 6 of the divorce judgment; second, that she erred
    in awarding interest at the rate provided in the divorce judgment (10%) instead
    of the rate under the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>.</p>
  <h3>1.       The Interpretation of Paragraph 6 of the Divorce Judgment</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge was correct in concluding that the appellant’s interest in the
    Air Canada Pension Plan was a property interest.  Under paragraph 6 of the
    divorce judgment, the parties agreed that the respondent was effectively
    entitled to what became a 35.17% share in that property interest, that is,
    in Mr. Saliba’s pension benefits “on the same terms and conditions he receives
    them when he receives them.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Saliba contends that he did not receive his pension benefits until he began
    receiving monthly payments under the annuity into which he eventually transferred
    the lump sum amount of his pension.  We disagree with that contention.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Likely
    the parties did contemplate that receipt of the pension benefits would begin
    when monthly payments began.  Mr. Saliba, however, retired early, and elected
    to transfer his pension money initially into a locked-in RRSP.  At that point
    the trial judge concluded he was in receipt of his pension benefits.  We
    agree with her conclusion.  She took a common sense and practical view of
    the meaning of the word “receives”
    under the divorce judgement.  Mr. Saliba effectively received his benefits
    when he chose to direct them into the RRSP.  He received them because he
    had control over them.  Thus at that time, in July 1992, Ms. Reid was equally
    entitled to a lump sum transfer of her interest into an RRSP.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Saliba argues that the trial judge failed to give effect to the distinction
    in the legislation between “pension benefit” and
    “pension benefit credit.”  Bearing in mind that the divorce judgement was
    drafted nearly 20 years ago when lawyers were not as sophisticated as they
    now are about the intricacies of pension claims, we think that the trial
    judge correctly interpreted paragraph 6 by looking at the common sense and
    ordinary meaning of the word “receives.”  We, therefore, decline to give
    effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h3>2.       Interest Rate</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Reid’s claim was a claim under the divorce judgment.  That judgment provided
    for interest on unpaid claims at 10% per annum.  Therefore, the trial judge
    correctly used this rate in calculating the amount of the award.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these brief reasons, the appeal is dismissed, with costs fixed in the amount
    of $3,500, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
