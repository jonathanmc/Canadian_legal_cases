  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was convicted of committing an aggravated assault on Daniel Graham,
    contrary to s. 268(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S. 1985, c. C-46 and
    of using a firearm while committing that indictable offence, contrary to
    s. 85(1)(a) of the <i>Code</i>. He was sentenced to 11 months in jail (after
    receiving a credit of 16 months for pre-trial custody) for the first conviction,
    and the mandatory minimum of 12 months in jail consecutive for the second
    conviction, to be followed by three years probation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    appeals both conviction and sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the conviction appeal, the only issue raised is whether the trial judge erred
    in his analysis of the mental element required to convict the appellant of
    the s. 85(1)(a) offence. The appellant does not contest his conviction for
    aggravated assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the facts were in a large measure uncontested. On December 31, 2005,
    a number of young men in their late teens decided to celebrate at the home
    of one of them by drinking to excess. Some time after 1:00 a.m., the victim
    Daniel Graham, who had fallen asleep on the couch, was awakened by a commotion.
    He saw the appellant, who was one of his friends, standing about three feet
    from him with a pellet gun in his hand. The next thing Mr. Graham knew, the
    gun discharged and a pellet struck him in the left eye, ultimately costing
    him the sight in that eye.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant admitted discharging the gun but said that the shooting was an
    accident. The trial judge rejected the appellant’s evidence of accident,
    finding that it did not raise a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    he also found that the Crown had failed to establish that the appellant intended
    to shoot a pellet at Mr. Graham.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then went on to consider recklessness. He concluded that the
    Crown had established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had a
    gun in his hand and knew it to be a danger, that he pointed it at Mr. Graham,
    and that he pulled the trigger. While the trial judge was not satisfied that
    the appellant had the necessary intention to shoot Mr. Graham, he found that
    the appellant, knowing the risk that the gun if fired could seriously hurt
    someone, was reckless in his use of the gun. He concluded that the appellant
    therefore had the necessary <i>mens rea</i> for aggravated assault and convicted
    him of that charge.  While I have considerable doubt about whether recklessness
    is the proper basis on which to find the mental element in the circumstances
    of this case, there can be no doubt that the facts support the necessary <i>mens
    rea </i> and that the conviction was proper. Moreover, since neither this
    conviction nor the accompanying <i>mens rea</i> finding are contested here,
    I accept both for the purpose of this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then heard further argument on the mental element necessary for
    the s. 85(1)(a) offence. He decided that, because the s. 85(1)(a) offence
    is one of general intent, the recklessness he had found regarding the use
    of the gun satisfied the <i>mens rea</i> required for that offence as well
    and, as a result, convicted the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant attacks his conviction on the basis that the offence created by
    s. 85(1)(a) of the <i>Code </i>is one of specific intent not general intent,
    and therefore the Crown must prove more than recklessness to establish the
    necessary <i>mens rea</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    85(1)(a) of the <i>Code</i> reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>85. (1) Every person commits an offence who uses
    a firearm</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            (a)       while committing an indictable
    offence, other than an offence under section 220 (criminal negligence causing
    death), 236 (manslaughter), 239 (attempted murder), 244 (causing bodily harm
    with intent – firearm), 272 (sexual assault with a weapon) or 273 (aggravated
    sexual assault), subsection 279(1) (kidnapping) or section 279.1 (hostage-taking),
    344 (robbery) or 346 (extortion),</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>whether or not the person causes or means to cause
    bodily harm to any person as a result of using the firearm.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R.
      v. Pringle</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1645, the Supreme Court of Canada made
      clear that a conviction and sentence for the underlying offence is a necessary
      prerequisite for a conviction under s. 85(1)(a). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the trial judge properly followed this approach by first convicting
    the appellant of aggravated assault. As I have said, in doing so, the trial
    judge was not satisfied that the appellant intended to shoot a pellet at
    Mr. Graham, but found the <i>mens rea</i> necessary for this offence in the
    fact that the appellant was reckless about whether that could happen when
    he fired the gun.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the trial judge turned to the s. 85(1)(a) offence, he addressed as his primary
    task the question of whether this offence is one of general or specific intent.
    Finding it to be one of general intent, he held that the mental element required
    was satisfied by the finding of recklessness he had made in convicting the
    appellant of aggravated assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    distinction between offences of general or specific intent has been of most
    importance in addressing the question of whether drunkenness can negate the
    mental element required for conviction. See, for example, <i>R. v. Daviault</i>,<i> </i>[1994]
    3 S.C.R. 63.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    distinction between the two was described in <i>Daviault</i> by Sopinka J.
    dissenting, but not on this point, at pp. 123-24:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The principles that emerge from the cases which
    serve as guidelines in classifying offences as specific or general intent
    offences are as follows. General intent offences as a rule are those which
    require the minimal intent to do the act which constitutes the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i>. Proof of intent is usually inferred from the commission of the
    act on the basis of the principle that a person intends the natural consequences
    of his or her act. …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Specific intent offences are as a rule those that
    require a mental element beyond that of general intent offences and include “those
    generally more serious offences where the <i>mens rea</i> must involve not
    only the intentional performance of the <i>actus reus</i> but, as well, the
    formation of further ulterior motives and purposes” (<i>per </i>McIntyre
    J. in <i>R. v. Bernard, supra</i>, at p. 880). These are often referred to
    as “ulterior intent” offences. See <i>Majewski</i>, <i>supra</i>. Professor
    Colvin, in “A Theory of the Intoxication Defence”
    (1981), 59 <i>Can. Bar Rev.</i> 750, correctly points out that it is the
    further intent in addition to the basic intent that is the hallmark of ulterior
    intent offences. …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying
    the definitions of general and specific intent offences articulated by Sopinka
    J., I agree with the trial judge that s. 85(1)(a) is a crime of general intent.
    The requisite <i>mens rea</i> relates only to the conduct which constitutes
    the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i> (the use of the weapon) and not to an ulterior motive or purpose.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    categorization of the offence created by s. 85(1)(a) as a crime of general
    intent does not fully describe the fault element, or <i>mens rea</i>, of
    the offence or address the issue of whether the necessary <i>mens rea</i> exists
    in a given case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    85(1)(a) creates the crime. The language of the section must inform the <i>mens
    rea</i> analysis. The section prohibits the use of a firearm while committing
    most indictable offences. There is nothing in the language of the section
    that suggests any culpable state of mind other than the intention to do the
    prohibited act, that is, to use the firearm while committing the underlying
    offence. Pointing and firing a gun clearly constitutes the use of a firearm.
    In the circumstances of this case, the <i>mens rea </i>of the offence required
    that the appellant intend to point and fire the gun. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    mental element is not coincident with the mental element for the underlying
    aggravated assault. The appellant’s intention to fire the gun while committing
    the underlying offence is distinct from his intent concerning where the pellet
    would go when he did so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    the trial judge erred in law in concluding that the recklessness he found
    to constitute the <i>mens rea</i> for the aggravated assault could also serve
    as the <i>mens rea</i> required for the appellant’s s. 85(1)(a) conviction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the trial judge clearly found as a fact that the appellant intended to fire
    the gun while committing the aggravated assault. He found that the appellant
    pointed the gun at Mr. Graham and pulled the trigger. That is enough to establish
    the <i>mens rea</i> needed to convict the appellant of the s. 85(1)(a) offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    finding makes this an appropriate case in which to apply s. 686(1)(b)(iii)
    of the <i>Code</i>. No substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred
    because, if the trial judge had correctly addressed the issue of the <i>mens
    rea</i> necessary for the s. 85(1)(a) offence, he would necessarily have
    found that it was properly established, given his findings of fact.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, because it does not arise on the facts of this case, I do not
    think it necessary to decide whether the <i>mens rea</i> required for a s.
    85(1)(a) conviction can be satisfied by recklessness in the use of the gun
    while committing the underlying offence. Nor should I be taken as agreeing
    with the trial judge that it can be.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would therefore dismiss the conviction appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was sentenced to a global sentence of 39 months, which was reduced
    to 23 months because of credit for pre-trial custody. The 23 months was made
    up of 11 months for the aggravated assault and the 12 month minimum required
    by the <i>Code</i> for the s. 85(1)(a) conviction. In my view, the trial
    judge did not err in principle in sentencing the appellant. In addition,
    the sentence is not disproportionate to the offences given the serious injury
    suffered by the victim. The sentence appeal must also be dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was self-represented but was ably assisted by duty counsel, Mr.
    Snell. We were much assisted by his helpful submissions and equally by those
    of Ms. Crosbie for the Crown.</p>
