  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the decision of
    Justice Albert J. Roy of the Superior Court of Justice dated January 25, 2006,
    dismissing a summary conviction appeal from the decision of Justice Ryan of the
    Ontario Court of Justice dated April 15, 2005.</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Rice seeks to set aside his conviction for having failed
    to provide a breath sample pursuant to s. 254(5) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  He was
    convicted by Justice Ryan of the Ontario Court of Justice on April 15,
    2005.  His summary conviction appeal was
    dismissed by Roy J. on January 25, 2006.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On March 25, 2004, Mr. Rice was stopped by police officers
    because he was driving a vehicle with a burnt out headlight.  Although the officers detected an odour of
    alcohol on his breath and Mr. Rice had bloodshot eyes, he told the police
    officers that he had not consumed any alcohol that day, although he
    subsequently acknowledged that he had consumed “a couple of drinks” at 6:30
    p.m.  He was stopped at approximately
    10:46&nbsp;p.m.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Over a nine-minute period between 11:10 p.m. and 11:19 p.m.,
    the appellant provided thirteen unsuitable breath samples.  He was instructed by the police officers
    twice on how the screening device worked and how he should give his sample by
    providing one strong and steady breath for a duration of approximately eight to
    ten seconds.  On each occasion, however,
    the appellant provided short, quick, puffing breaths, which were unsuitable for
    the device.  Mr. Rice indicated to the
    police officers that he was “really tired” and that he wanted to go home to
    bed.  After the twelfth attempt, the
    police officer warned the appellant that there could be criminal consequences
    for continued failure to provide a suitable sample.  At 11:21 p.m., after the thirteenth failed attempt, the appellant
    was arrested for failing to comply with a demand.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge summarized the evidence and concluded there
    was no doubt in his mind that the appellant intentionally refused to provide
    the breath sample properly into the device.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the appeal, the appellant raises two grounds, namely,
    whether the summary conviction appeal court judge erred:</p>
  <p>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>by finding that the trial judge provided adequate and
    meaningful reasons and, </p>
  <p>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>by finding that the trial judge properly considered the
    appellant’s evidence in accordance with the requirements of the Supreme Court
    of Canada in <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his capable oral argument, Mr. Foord did not pursue the
    separate <i>W.(D.)</i> ground.  Rather, he wrapped it up in the <i>Sheppard</i> argument concerning the
    inadequacy of the reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would not give effect to these grounds of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is ample evidence in the record to support the trial
    judge’s factual finding that the appellant intentionally refused to adhere to
    the request of the police officers to blow properly into the machine and,
    accordingly, that he failed or refused to provide a breath sample as
    required.  There was and is no basis for
    interfering with that finding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the trial judge made no specific reference to the
    appellant’s explanation that he was really tired and wanted to go home to bed,
    or to the police officer’s comment in cross-examination that “it looked as if
    [the appellant] was trying to comply with what [he] was asking him to do,” it
    is apparent from the reasons read as a whole that the trial judge weighed all
    of the evidence and was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not think the summary conviction appeal court judge
    erred in the circumstances of this case in observing that this was not a
    classic <i>W.(D.)</i> type of
    situation.  Nor do we accept that the
    trial judge’s reasons failed to meet the <i>Sheppard</i> test.  They are brief but they
    demonstrate that he reviewed and considered all of the evidence as it related
    to the pertinent issues and applied the proper principles, as the summary
    conviction appeal judge noted.  The
    trial judge made the essential connection between the police officers’
    explanation of the need for a long hard blow and the appellant’s continued
    pattern of providing short, quick breaths over a period of thirteen
    opportunities and found on the facts that “there was clearly an attempt … to
    thwart the proper test being performed.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our opinion, the appellant is able to understand on reading
    these reasons –  including the reasons
    for sentence that follow immediately after the conviction – why he was
    convicted, and the summary conviction appeal court and this court are able to
    give them meaningful appellate review.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, leave to appeal is granted but the appeal is
    dismissed.</p>
