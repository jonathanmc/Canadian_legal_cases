  <h2>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants argue that the contract between the respondents and the company
    prevented them ever recovering what was owed to them once the bankruptcy
    occurred. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree. The trial judge did not find that the employees agreed that on
    bankruptcy these debts would never be payable. Rather, he found that they
    agreed that the debts owed to them would not be payable until the company
    was in funds but, in effect, only so long as that remained a possibility.
    The bankruptcy made this impossible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is considerable evidence to support this view of the contract, including
    that the employees were persuaded to put off payment of their wages because
    of the prospect that funds would become available. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    consequence is that once the bankruptcy brought to an end the contractual
    condition suspending the respondents’ right to be paid, those debts were
    owing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    determination of the terms of the postponement contract is also fatal to
    the appellants’ estoppel argument. The respondents’
    position concerning their legal rights against the company, and therefore
    against the appellants, is captured by the terms of the contract. Once the
    bankruptcy took place, their debts were owing and it would be inequitable
    to prevent them from enforcing those debts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Likewise,
    the contract is the answer to the appellants’
    argument concerning the dates of termination of employment of the respondents
    as the trigger for the limitation period. The contract has the result of
    making those debts payable only on bankruptcy. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    last argument raised by the appellants is that they say Mr. Sarajlic did
    not provide evidence that he had proven his claim in bankruptcy. In our view,
    there was ample evidence from which the trial judge could reach the conclusion
    he did namely, that the claim had been proven properly in the bankruptcy.
    We say that particularly in view of the fact that this trial was conducted
    under the simplified rules.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue of costs awarded at trial was raised in argument but only as to quantum.
    The quantum in our view was a matter that was in the trial judge’s discretion
    and we see no basis for interfering with it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    in the appeal brought by Mr. Marshall and Ms. Gonze we are in general agreement
    with the conclusions reached by the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning
    to Mr. Baldry’s appeal, in our view, the appeal must succeed. The six-month
    limitation period provided by the governing legislation, the <i>Ontario Business
    Corporations Act</i>, commenced as of May 14, 2001, when the trial judge
    determined as a finding of fact that Mr. Baldry’s resignation took place.
    That finding of fact in our view cannot be disturbed in this court. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent argues however that the constraint on suing provided by the <i>Bankruptcy
    and Insolvency Act</i> changes that limitation period.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the appellant that the action was out of time when commenced,
    because it was more than six months after May 14, and because for the purposes
    of the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i>, Mr. Baldry is a former director
    not one to whom the constraint applies. Moreover any constraint could be
    relieved against under s. 69.4 of the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus
    we find that Mr. Baldry’s appeal as against Mr. Sarajlic must be successful.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, the appeals of Mr. Marshall and Ms. Gonze must be dismissed.
    The appeal of Mr. Baldry must be allowed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs
    in the former appeal to counsel for Dragutesco and Al Kas in the amount of
    $10,000.00 and in the amount of $5,000.00 to the respondent Sarajlic, both
    inclusive of G.S.T. and disbursements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the second appeal the trial judgment is set aside and the action against
    Mr. Baldry is dismissed. The order for costs at trial is amended to provide
    that Mr. Sarajlic pay $5,000.00 to Mr. Baldry as his costs of the trial.  The
    costs of the appeal will be paid by Mr. Sarajlic to Mr. Baldry in the amount
    of $5,000.00. Both figures are inclusive of G.S.T. and disbursements.</p>
