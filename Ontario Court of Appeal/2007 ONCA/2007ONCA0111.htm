    November 25, 2000, a bailiff, Robert Langton, seized the appellants’ boat at
    the Barrie Yacht Club marina and brought it to the respondent’s premises for
    storage.  The boat was removed from its
    mooring at the club because the club took the position that the appellants had
    failed to pay their membership and mooring fees and because the boat was at
    risk of being damaged by the water freezing around it.</span></p>

    December 19, 2000, Langton delivered to the appellants a Notice of Lien, which
    is the subject of this appeal.  Among
    other things, the notice indicated that there would be storage charges of $20
    per day for storing the boat at the respondent’s compound.  I will discuss the contents of this notice
    in more detail below.  The appellants
    did not pay the storage charges nor did they attempt to redeem the boat from
    the respondent.  </span></p>

    2001 and 2002, the appellants sued the Barrie Yacht Club and Langton, claiming
    damages for, among other things, wrongful seizure and unlawful impounding of
    the boat.  The Small Claims Court deputy
    judge dismissed their action.  The
    Divisional Court upheld the dismissal (see <i>Schaer
    v. Barrie Yacht Club</i> (2003), 180 O.A.C. 90) and this court refused leave to
    appeal.  </span></p>

    16, 2002, the respondent gave the appellants a notice of his intention to sell
    the boat for unpaid storage charges pursuant to s. 15 of the Act.  However, he did not proceed with the
    sale.  On April 5, 2004, the respondent
    gave the appellants a second notice of intention to sell the boat.  The appellants objected to the sale of the
    boat.  </span></p>

    October 29, 2004, the respondent brought the application that gives rise to
    this appeal under s. 23(1) of the Act, seeking a declaration that he had a
    possessory lien over the boat, a determination of the amount of the lien, a
    declaration that he is entitled to sell the boat and judgment against the
    appellants in the amount of the lien.</span></p>

    March 24, 2005, the application judge held that the respondent was entitled to
    all of the relief requested.  He issued
    a declaration that the amount of the lien was $29,920, as of January 25, 2005,
    with an additional $20 per day accumulating until the boat is sold or the
    appellants pay the storage fees.  He
    granted a judgment against the appellants in that amount.  He also made a declaration that the respondent
    is entitled to sell the boat and ordered the appellants to pay the respondent’s
    costs of the application.</span></p>

    storer, did not give the notice; Langton did.  There is no evidence that Langton was acting as the agent of the

    mandatory only with respect to identifying those persons to whom notice should
    be given.  It is directory as to who
    must give the notice.  The respondent
    argues that because the appellant received all of the information required by
    s. 4(5) of the Act, any error in the procedure by which the notice was given
    should not render it a nullity.  </span></p>

    it may be successfully argued in some circumstances that the giving of notice

    problem with the notice in this case, is that it gives notice of a lien claim
    for amounts in addition to the respondent’s storage charges.  It indicates that the amount that the
    appellants must pay to satisfy the lien includes $628.00 for boat removal and
    transportation, $535.00 for legal and administration costs, and $50.00 owing to
    the Barrie Yacht Club.  None of these
    amounts was either owed to the respondent, or properly the subject of its
    storer’s lien.    </span></p>

    is nothing in the Act to suggest that a storer, such as the respondent, may use
    its storer’s lien to claim others’ unrelated debts.  Indeed, s. 4(1) of the Act is specific.  The storer’s lien against an article is limited to either the amount
    agreed upon (not this case), or the fair value of the storage, including related
    expenses incurred.  There is no evidence
    to suggest that the additional amounts claimed in the Langton notice were
    incurred in relation to the respondent’s storage of the boat.  </span></p>

    when the respondent eventually asserted his own claim against the appellants in
    the notices of intention to sell delivered in May 2002 and April 2004, he
    claimed only his charges for storage at the rate of $20 per day.  He did not then, nor on any other occasion,
    assert that the other amounts claimed in the Langton notice were included in
    his storer’s lien.  </span></p>

    4(5)(d) of the Act requires that a notice of lien include a statement of how a
    stored article may be redeemed.  The
    scheme of the Act is that an article subject to a storer’s lien may be redeemed
    by the owner upon payment of the storer’s charges calculated in accordance with
    s. 4(1) of the Act.  The obvious intent
    of s. 4(5)(d) is that the notice should include an accurate statement about how
    the owner may redeem an article.  Clearly, the notice should not overstate the amount that must be
    paid.  </span></p>

line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Potentially,
    the Langton notice created a significant disincentive to the appellants to
    redeem the boat.  The record discloses
    that at the time the appellants received the Langton notice they were in the midst
    of ongoing disputes with the Barrie Yacht Club and Langton.  They were very upset that the boat had been
    moved to the respondent’s premises without their consent.  Whatever the merits of those disagreements
    might have been, a valid notice of the respondent’s storer’s lien should not
    have required payment of other amounts over which the respondent did not have a
    lien claim in order to redeem the boat.  </span></p>

    result, I conclude that that the Langton notice did not comply with the
    requirements of s. 4 of the Act.  As
    mentioned above, the consequence of this finding is that, under s. 4(6) of the
    Act, the respondent’s lien is limited to $1,200.00.</span></p>

    my conclusion that the amount of the respondent’s lien is limited to $1,200,
    judgment in favour of the respondent in the amount of the total of the
    respondent’s storage charges cannot stand.  On the record in this case, it is clear that the amount of the judgment
    was directly linked to the amount of the storer’s lien as found by the application
    judge.</span></p>

    application judge issued the judgment against the appellants under s. 23(1)(e),
    the purpose of which is to give effect to rights arising from the application
    of the Act.  The relevant part of that
    section reads as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>23.(1)  Any person may apply to a court for a determination of the rights

    other matter arising out of the application of the Act,</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span

    Act, as its title suggests, is directed at creating liens and providing for
    remedies for the enforcement of liens.  It is not concerned with other claims, in law or in equity, that may
    arise between an owner, on the one hand, and a storer or repairer, on the
    other.  The respondent’s application
    linked his request for judgment directly to the amount of his lien.  He did not seek judgment for amounts owing
    on the basis of a claim for unjust enrichment or on any other basis unrelated
    to his claim for a storer’s lien.  </span></p>

    in this court and on the application below, the parties approached the issues

    I would set aside the judgment in favour of the respondent.  The parties did not make submissions as to
    whether or not, if this court were to reduce the respondent’s lien claim to
    $1,200 as I would do, there should also be judgment in that amount in favour of
    the respondent.  We were told that the
    value of the boat is sufficient to satisfy the respondent’s lien.  In these circumstances, I do not find it
    necessary to decide whether, under s. 23(1) of the Act, a court that makes a
    declaration that a party has a lien also has the authority to order a separate
    judgment for the amount of that lien.</span></p>

    lien instead be $1,200.  I would amend
    para. 4 of the judgment to provide that any amount received by the respondent
    on the sale of the boat over $1,200 be payable to the appellants.  Paragraphs  1 and 3 of the judgment, granting the respondent a possessory lien in
    respect of the appellants’ sailboat and allowing him to sell the boat in
    satisfaction of the lien, continue in effect.</span></p>
