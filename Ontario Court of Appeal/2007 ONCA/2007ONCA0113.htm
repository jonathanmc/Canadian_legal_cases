  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is an appeal from an order dismissing an appeal from an
    order for Crown wardship with no access.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The child was born on August 17, 2004.  The mother was 16 years old.  When it became apparent that the mother was
    unable to care for the child, on November 17, 2004, the Children’s
    Aid Society of the Regional Municipality of Waterloo</a>, on the basis of a
    voluntary agreement, obtained an order for five months wardship, with access to
    the parents, as the child was found to be in need of protection.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the status review of that order, the Crown brought a motion
    for summary judgment seeking an order to have the child made a ward of the
    Crown without access in order to place the child for adoption.  By that time, the concerns about the mother
    being able to care for the child had escalated into issues involving domestic
    violence, emotional instability, financial instability, housing issues, family
    instability, lack of support and, most dramatically, the mother’s addiction to
    crack cocaine.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 28, 2005, the status review judge noted that the
    mother was transient, had at times exercised access to the child only
    sporadically, had incurred criminal charges, had developed a serious and
    significant addiction to cocaine, and had never shown or demonstrated a
    consistent commitment to counselling.  In addition, there was no real plan of care in existence for the child
    put forward by the mother or any family members.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The status review judge concluded that the Society had shown a <i>prima</i> <i>facie</i> case for Crown wardship without access and the mother had not
    led evidence sufficient to demonstrate that there was a genuine issue to be
    tried.  As the mother had no chance of
    success in having the child returned to her and he granted the motion for
    summary judgment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The mother appealed.  Her access was terminated by the summary judgment but no attempt to stay
    the judgment was ever sought.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the hearing of the appeal, on August 11, 2006, the mother
    filed fresh affidavit evidence.  She
    claimed that her life was now stable, that she had addressed her drug addiction
    and that family members put forward plans to care for the child.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In detailed reasons, the appeal judge made a complete review
    of the facts of the case including the relevant facts dealing with the mother,
    the Society, the reasons of the status review judge and the fresh
    evidence.  He also reviewed the
    applicable law and jurisprudence.  He
    concluded that the status review judge had made no errors.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the fresh evidence, the appeal judge stated
    that he had considerable difficulty in accepting why the family members did not
    come forward to support the mother when she was having such a terrible struggle
    from September 2004 to September 2005.  He found their explanations unimpressive.  He admitted the fresh evidence but declined to give effect to it
    as it would not be in the best interest of the child to send the matter to
    trial on the basis of that evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal judge also noted that the evidence before the
    status review judge was that the bond between the mother and child was weak as
    a result of the mother’s failure to take the necessary steps to put herself in
    the position where she could care for the child without supervision.  On the other hand, the child was adoptable
    and had been with a family who wished to adopt her since August 2005 (this
    should be October 2005).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal judge dismissed the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the appeal judge did not make any error.  His inferences and conclusions are supported
    by the evidence and he applied the law correctly.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The mother submitted additional fresh evidence on this
    appeal.  She has turned her life around
    in commendable fashion.  However, at
    this stage, such evidence cannot change the result reached by both lower
    courts.  The last supervised access by
    the mother was on September 22, 2005.  Her father, M.L., had only attended one visit with the child prior to
    the granting of the summary judgment.  Her mother, K.L., and her current partner, G.E., have never met the
    child.  The child has been with an
    adoptive family since October 2005.  She
    is 2½ years old.  It would not be in her
    best interest to be removed from her adoptive family and placed with the
    appellant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, it must be
    assumed that the Society is properly exercising its statutory duty and acting
    in the best interest of the child.  Time
    is an important consideration in the <i>Child
    and Family Services Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.11 and a child is not to be kept
    in limbo while a parent having difficulties attempts to straighten out her
    life.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed without costs.</p>
