    police officers stopped the respondent in his car on the basis of a tip from
    a confidential informer.  They found a loaded gun in the back seat and charged
    the respondent with a number of weapons offences.  The respondent served
    notice of a challenge to the legality of his detention and the search of
    his car under ss. 8 and 9 of the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>. In
    support of the <i>Charter</i> application, anticipating from the evidence
    given at the preliminary inquiry that the police would rely on the reliability
    of the informer, the respondent sought disclosure of the contents of the
    Confidential Informant File and any other documents relating to contacts
    between the informer and the Toronto Police Service (“TPS”).  The Crown resisted
    production on the basis that the material sought was irrelevant and protected
    by informer privilege.  The respondent conceded that the “innocence at stake” exception
    to informer privilege did not apply and agreed that he had no right to the
    disclosure of anything that would reveal the identity of the informer.  An
    edited version of the file kept by the police to record contacts with the
    informer was disclosed to the respondent, but the Crown and the police resisted
    production of any other material.  After a lengthy process of argument, production
    and editing that extended over five weeks, the trial judge ordered the disclosure
    of three files of heavily-edited documents and dismissed a Crown application
    to protect the documents from disclosure under to s. 37 of the <i>Evidence
    Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c.C-5. </p>

    Crown appeals the dismissal of the s. 37 application, arguing that (1) much
    of this material is irrelevant to the issues raised on the <i>Charter</i> application,
    and (2) in any event, there is a significant risk that the edited version
    of the documents would reveal the identity of the informer. </p>

    following evidence was given at the preliminary hearing as well as at trial
    on a <i>voir dire</i> on the appellant’s <i>Stinchcombe</i> disclosure application.  Officer
    Mike Allen of the Toronto Police Service received a tip from a “carded” confidential
    informer (i.e. a known informer having an established relationship with the
    police) with whom he had dealt ten to twenty times in the past and who had
    proved to be reliable.  The informer had a criminal record.  The informer
    told Officer Allen that a man would be in a specific neighbourhood with a
    gun located behind the armrest in the backseat of his car.  The informer
    provided a detailed description of the person, his clothing, and his car,
    including a licence plate number. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Acting
    on this information, the police found a man and a car matching the informer’s
    description.  Officer Allen and Officer Male followed the car until it turned
    around and came face-to-face with the police car and stopped.  The two officers
    got out of their car and approached the other car.  They identified themselves
    as police officers.  Officer Male, at the passenger side of the respondent’s
    car, noticed that the back seat armrest was down.  He testified: “I could
    see the handgun with the barrel pointed down behind the -- the car seat”.  He
    yelled “gun” and Officer Allen opened the driver’s side door, placed the
    respondent under arrest and removed him from the vehicle.  The respondent
    was searched, the gun was seized from his car, and the respondent was eventually
    charged with several weapons offences and with possession of the proceeds
    of crime.  Allen paid the informer $125 for the information leading to these
    charges.</p>

line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent served a timely notice of a <i>Charter</i> application to challenge, <i>inter
    alia</i>, the legality of his detention under s. 9 and of the search of his
    person and his car under s. 8. The respondent also served a Notice of Application
    for Disclosure  of:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>the contents
    of the Confidential Informant file as maintained by the Superintendent of
    Detective Services, and any other documents in the custody of the Toronto
    Police Service that relate to prior dealings with the Confidential Informant

  <p align=left style='text-align:left'>The Crown did not respond to either notice
    prior to trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial began on May 8, 2006 with the respondent’s disclosure application.  The
    Crown resisted disclosure, arguing that the documents sought were not relevant
    to any issue before the court and even if they were, they were subject to
    informer privilege.  The trial Crown took the position that when the police
    stopped the respondent, they were conducting a valid investigative detention
    which did not depend upon the informer’s reliability.  Similarly, as the
    gun was in plain view of the police, the Crown took the position that the
    warrantless search and seizure could be supported without the need to establish
    the informer’s reliability. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
    than once, the respondent’s trial counsel clearly and unequivocally stated
    that if the Crown did not intend to rely upon the reliability of the informer
    to support the validity of the detention and the search and seizure, he would
    abandon the disclosure application.  The trial judge put this squarely to
    the trial Crown.  The trial Crown failed to provide the trial judge with
    a direct response but continued to assert the material sought by way of disclosure
    was irrelevant.  The Crown’s response, or lack thereof, can only be taken
    as a refusal to make the concession that seemed to flow logically from the
    submissions the Crown was making.  This concession could have eliminated
    the need to spend five weeks of court time on the issue of disclosure and
    informer privilege, a peripheral matter in the context of this trial.  As
    I will explain below, the respondent and the Crown took similar positions
    on this issue before this court.  The respondent conceded that the “innocence
    at stake” exception did not apply and that anything produced could be edited
    to avoid disclosure of the informer’s identity, but as the Crown refused
    to concede that the reliability of the informer would not be used in support
    of the detention and search, insisted that he was entitled to the requested
    disclosure. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    hearing evidence by way of <i>voir dire</i> and listening to extensive argument,
    the trial judge ruled on May 10 that “the records that the defence seeks
    to have produced are relevant to the question of the confidential informant’s
    reliability” and ordered their production, subject to editing to avoid revealing
    the informer’s identity.
     The TPS, as custodian of the records sought, requested and was granted intervenor
    status with respect to the issue of informer privilege and editing. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Confidential Informant File was edited and produced to the respondent on
    May 12.  I observe that before this court, the Crown took the position that
    this file should not have been disclosed to the respondent.  However, the
    Crown concedes that as the file has been produced, nothing can be done at
    this stage.  Accordingly, I intend to say nothing in these reasons about
    the propriety of the disclosure of this file. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    disclosure issue was revisited when the respondent asked for disclosure of
    the informer’s criminal record and it was brought to the trial judge’s attention
    that the Crown and TPS had interpreted the trial judge’s initial order narrowly to
    include only the Confidential Informant File.  After further extensive submissions,
    and over the strong objections of the trial Crown counsel, the trial judge
    ruled on May 15 “for absolute clarity”, that the informer’s criminal record
    and all other documents in the possession of the TPS, that “deal with ...
    contact with the confidential informant” be produced to the court to be considered
    for relevance to the question of “the police’s decision to act upon the information
    of the informant”, and if relevant, to be edited and produced. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Matters
    were delayed for several days when the respondent was arrested on other charges
    and could not be brought before the trial court.  The TPS engaged in an extensive
    search for all records in its possession relating to the informer. Some documents
    were produced to the court on May 23.  The trial judge heard further submissions
    and, with the respondent’s agreement, ruled that the Crown need not produce
    documents relating to incidents where the informer was a victim or a witness
    occurring after the date of the offence.  The Crown attempted to highlight
    the documents to indicate information that might identify the informer.  Before
    that exercise had been completed, the trial judge directed the Crown to provide
    her with the documents so that she could consider what was relevant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    May 26, the trial judge presented the Crown with five sealed packages of
    documents.  Two packages contained documents that the trial judge ruled were
    irrelevant.  Three packages contained documents the trial judged ruled to
    be relevant.  These included documents relating to investigations involving
    the informer that
    “didn’t lead to a charge or perhaps charges that were either withdrawn or
    dismissed”.  Those documents had been edited to remove information the trial
    judge thought would tend to identify the informer.  She ordered that those
    three packages be produced to the defence, but ruled that if Crown counsel
    took issue with her editing, he could address the issue in open court before
    producing the documents to the defence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    May 30, the Crown took issue with the trial judge’s editing and submitted
    that if the material were disclosed, it would “clearly reveal the identity
    of the informer”.  The Crown, supported by counsel for the TPS, expressed
    its concern for the “actual physical safety of the confidential informant” and “the
    grave and permanent import given the nature of the concern of the confidential
    informant” and asked for the opportunity either to make <i>ex parte </i>submissions
    or to file a sealed affidavit for the trial judge’s eyes only explaining
    the Crown’s concerns.  The trial judge denied this request.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    June 2, the Crown attempted to lead the evidence of Detective Gerry Heaney
    as an expert on confidential informants to explain the type of information
    that would tend to disclose the identity of the informer.  The trial judge
    ruled that Detective Heaney’s proposed evidence failed to meet the <i>R.
    v. Mohan</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9 test for admissibility of expert evidence.  The
    Crown and counsel for the TPS provided the trial judge with their suggested
    further edits, arguing that as the court could not know what “the accused
    and others who have criminal intent know” or “what their suspicions are” or “who
    they suspect as being the confidential informer, or how narrow the pool of
    suspects has become”, disclosure of anything was like “stepping through a
    mine field….one wrong foot out of place can have disastrous results”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several
    days later, on June 6, the trial judge provided her final edits to the Crown
    and ordered production.  At this point, the Crown invoked s.37 of the <i>Canada
    Evidence Act, </i>which provides that a Minister of the Crown or other official
    may certify “orally or in writing to the court…that the information should
    not be disclosed on the grounds of a specified public interest.”  Pursuant
    to the relaxed standard for admissibility under s.&nbsp;37(6.1), which allows
    the court to receive evidence that is “reliable and appropriate, even if
    it would not otherwise be admissible under Canadian law”, the Crown renewed
    its request to call Detective Heaney.  The trial judge permitted the officer’s
    evidence to be called.  The trial judge initially ruled Detective Heaney
    to be an expert regarding police dealings with confidential informants and
    information that would tend to identify an informer.  She later ruled that
    Detective Heaney’s evidence dealt with issues of “common sense” and was not
    necessary under the <i>Mohan </i>criteria because nothing in the officer’s
    evidence required “special knowledge outside of the experience of the trier
    of fact”.  Accordingly, it was not expert evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Detective
    Heaney testified as to fifteen categories of information that would serve
    to identify an informer: (1) age; (2) gender; (3) occupation; (4) socio-economic
    status; (5) health-related issues; (6)  lifestyle choices; (7) associates;
    (8) connection with the arrest of other persons; (9) dates, times, locations,
    and the fact of contact with the police as an accused, victim, or witness;
    (10) criminal convictions, discharges, acquittals, and withdrawals; (11)
    any indication that the informer is or has been bound by a recognizance,
    undertaking, probation order, or prohibition order or is or has been on parole;
    (12) geographical areas frequented; (13) length of time in the community;
    (14) length of time as an informer; and (15) motivation for providing information.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Detective
    Heany testified that the Confidential Informant File should not have been
    produced.  He further testified that he had reviewed the documents edited
    by the trial judge and expressed the view that the portions of the documents
    highlighted by the Crown but left in by the trial judge fell within the fifteen
    categories and could serve to identify the informer.  Detective Heaney also
    testified that even the form of the documents with all information blacked
    out would indicate the nature of the contact between the informer and the
    police and that this alone could serve to identify the informer.  For the
    first time, the Crown took the position that none of the documents should
    be disclosed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    June 15, some six weeks after the respondent’s disclosure application was
    launched, the trial judge dismissed the Crown’s s. 37 application and ordered
    production of the documents as she had edited them.  Her amended reasons
    of June 20 explain her rationale for doing so:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The information
    that I ordered to be produced is relevant to the informant’s credibility,
    trustworthiness and reliability.  That information ought to be produced to
    the defence unless it identifies the informant or tends to do so.  Nothing
    in the evidence or material that I reviewed satisfies me that this is the
    case.</p>

line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
    found that the information that merely “narrows the pool of people who have
    the same characteristics or ‘identifiers’” could be disclosed as otherwise,
    the “mere mention of the involvement of a confidential informer would end
    any disclosure application” and “[t]here would be no need for a judicial
    editing in situations where a confidential informer has been involved.”</p>

    make some observations on the issue of trial management. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown argued strenuously on this appeal that this was a routine case that
    got badly out of hand and that some five weeks of court time were essentially
    wasted navigating the editing and production of documents requested by the
    defence which were completely irrelevant to the issues before the court. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    clear implication of the Crown’s submission is that the respondent and the
    trial judge are responsible for several weeks of lost court time: the respondent
    for making a far-fetched disclosure request, essentially intended to force
    the Crown to stay the prosecution rather than reveal the identity of an informer;
    and the trial judge for failing to rule that the material sought was irrelevant
    and, even if it was relevant, for failing to rule that any disclosure of
    the material requested would violate the informer privilege.  While I agree
    with the Crown’s overall assessment that what occurred here fell well short
    of the ideal of efficient trial management, the Crown shares substantial
    responsibility for the unfortunate manner in which this case unfolded in
    refusing to concede that it was not seeking to rely on the reliability of
    its informer and in failing to take a clear position on disclosure.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dealing
    first with the question of relevance, as I read this record, relevance depended
    essentially on the position taken by the Crown.
     As the respondent’s trial counsel put it very clearly at least twice during
    argument before the trial judge, the disclosure he sought was only relevant
    if the Crown intended to use the confidential informer’s reliability to support
    the validity of the detention and the search: if the Crown agreed that the
    informer’s reliability did not matter, the disclosure application would be
    withdrawn.  The trial Crown continued to argue relevance but refused to concede
    the point upon which his relevance argument turned. It is difficult to see
    why the Crown refused to make that concession. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was clear from the evidence of the two police officers and the submissions
    of the trial Crown that the Crown’s position was that the validity of the
    search rested on the assertion that there had been a proper investigative
    detention and that the gun was in plain view.  If the police officers were
    not believed that the gun was in plain view, as a practical matter, it is
    difficult to see how the Crown could then shift its ground and succeed by
    justifying a warrantless search on the basis of information provided by a
    reliable informer.  Indeed, the officers themselves testified that had the
    gun not been in plain view, they believed that a search warrant would have
    been required.  The entire issue of informer’s privilege, plainly a matter
    of monumental concern to the Crown and the TPS, could have been avoided without
    any significant impairment to the Crown’s case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning
    to the issue of informer privilege, here as well, had the Crown taken a clearer
    position at trial, the matter might well have unfolded more expeditiously.  It
    was only after several weeks, when the Crown brought the s.37 application,
    that the Crown advanced the position now asserted on appeal: that as the
    defence could not demonstrate innocence at stake, <i>none</i> of the documents
    could be disclosed because no editing could provide sufficient protection
    for the informer.  Prior to the s. 37 application, the Crown resisted disclosure
    essentially on the basis of relevance.  Once the trial judge rejected that
    position and focused on editing, the Crown engaged in a prolonged debate
    with the trial judge about how to edit the documents.  Moreover, as I have
    noted, the Crown had already disclosed an edited version of the Confidential
    Informant File, a position that surely undercut the position it later took
    on the s. 37 application that not even documents with all but the form blanked
    out could safely be disclosed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    said, the position taken by the defence at trial should also be considered.  The
    defence pressed the disclosure issue relentlessly, yet having already obtained
    the Confidential Informant File, it is difficult to understand what more
    the defence could realistically expect the files of the TPS to reveal that
    could have any bearing on the validity of the conduct of the two police officers
    who found the gun and arrested the respondent.  It would not be unduly cynical
    to infer that the defence tactic had less to do with a genuine request for
    relevant material and more to do with a strategy designed to force the Crown
    to stay the prosecution to avoid revealing the identity of the informer.  On
    the other hand, in fairness to the respondent, as I have already pointed
    out, throughout the entire proceeding, he has been crystal clear that the
    disclosure request would be withdrawn if the Crown conceded that it would
    not rely on the reliability of its informant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge certainly could and should have taken a firmer hand in moving
    this issue along.  She entertained lengthy and repetitive submissions that
    became an ongoing dialogue instead of insisting on focused submissions.  Her
    task was certainly made much more difficult by the failure of Crown counsel
    to develop a clear strategy and a focused approach that would deal clearly
    with the legal and factual issues raised by this case.  The trial judge was
    not required to proceed with the disclosure motion on the basis of an abstract
    theory of relevance that had no foundation in the evidence or anticipated
    evidence and the positions of the parties, or based on a legal argument that
    was doomed inevitably to failure.  The trial judge could have insisted that
    the trial Crown clearly state its position before proceeding with the disclosure
    motion.  If the Crown did not rely on the informer’s reliability, the trial
    judge was entitled to rule that the disclosure was irrelevant to the issues
    on the <i>Charter</i> application and dismiss the disclosure motion on that
    basis.  If the Crown refused to concede that it would not rely in the informer’s
    reliability, and the Crown was unable to articulate a tenable position on
    relevance, the trial judge was entitled to postpone ruling on the disclosure
    motion until it was possible to determine relevance on the basis of the record
    on the <i>Charter</i> motion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    proceedings are not designed on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis, but
    there surely must be an element of proportionality that informs the manner
    in which trials are conducted.  In this case, there has been a significant
    expenditure of resources with no benefit that I have been able to discern.  The
    judicial system, like all other public institutions, has limited resources
    at its disposal, as do the litigants and legal aid.  The purpose of this
    appeal, of course, is not to attribute blame for how an unfortunate situation
    developed which resulted in several weeks court time being swallowed up on
    a peripheral issue. Suffice it to say that every effort must be made to keep
    trials focused on the essential issues.  If not, there is a serious risk
    that our adversary trial system will simply collapse under its own weight
    and we will all be the poorer.  It is in the interest of all constituencies –
    those accused of crimes, the police, Crown counsel, defence counsel, and
    judges both at trial and on appeal – to make the most of the limited resources
    at our disposal. </p>

    I have already stated, it is my view that the Crown’s relevancy argument
    fails because the Crown refused to concede that it would not use the reliability

    this was a case about an investigative detention and the seizure of a weapon
    in plain view, the informer’s reliability did not matter and the disclosure
    application would have been withdrawn.  As the Crown refused to make this
    concession at trial, it is not open to the Crown on appeal to take the position
    that information relating to the confidential informer’s reliability is irrelevant.</p>

line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I

    privilege belongs to the informer, not to the police, and neither the police
    nor the courts have the power to deny an informer protection.  Informer privilege
    is not qualified by the <i>Stinchcombe </i>disclosure obligation imposed
    upon the Crown by the <i>Charter</i>: <i>Leipert</i>, <i>supra</i>,<i> </i>at
    paras. 23-25.  It is not a legal right that can be balanced against other
    competing rights or interests:  <i>Leipert</i>, at paras. 12, 14.  As stated
    in <i>Bisaillon</i>, <i>supra</i>,<i> </i>at 412, the application of confidential
    informer privilege “does not depend on the judge's discretion, as it is a
    legal rule of public order by which the judge is bound.”  <i>Leipert</i>,
    at para 17 holds that “[s]ubject only to the ‘innocence at stake’ exception,
    the Crown and the court are bound not to reveal the undisclosed informant's
    identity.”  Informer privilege protects not only the name of the informant
    but also “any information which implicitly might reveal his or her identity.”:  <i>Leipert</i>,
    at para. 18. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have already stated, it is agreed that the
    “innocence at stake” exception is not engaged in this case and the issue
    is whether the privilege will be defeated by the disclosure of the documents
    as edited by the trial judge.  As in<i> Leipert</i>, <i>supra</i>, the trial
    judge was faced with two competing rules.  On the one hand, as an accused
    person, the respondent was entitled to disclosure of all information that
    was not clearly irrelevant or privileged.  On the other hand, the informer
    was entitled to the protection of informer privilege.  The trial judge attempted
    to satisfy both rules by editing the documents in the TPS files relating
    to the informer and ordering production of the edited version.  As in <i>Leipert</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at para. 8, I conclude that the trial judge “gave insufficient weight to
    both the importance of maintaining informer privilege and the danger of ordering
    disclosure of [documents] which, despite editing, may enable an accused person
    to identify the informant.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, in the circumstance of this case, the trial judge erred by concluding
    that her edited version of the documents would not tend to identify the informer.  The
    informer had provided the police with very detailed information about where
    the respondent would be found, what he would be wearing, the very car he
    would be driving, and the precise location in the car where a gun would be
    found.  The pool of people who would be privy to that precise and detailed
    information must necessarily be very small. The individuals in that pool
    are likely known to the respondent.  Even the slightest piece of information
    about the informer gleaned from the police files could serve to eliminate
    some members of the pool or identify the informer.  This point was made in
    Detective Heaney’s testimony and has been recognized in the case law on informer’s
    privilege. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Leipert</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed the decision of McEachern C.J.B.C. ((1996),
    106 C.C.C. (3d) 375 (B.C.C.A.)) who stated at para 35: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

      about ordering the production of even a carefully edited tip sheet or report
      for which informant privilege is claimed. Judges should recognize that
      any confidence they may have about their ability to edit out information
      that might disclose the identity of an informant is probably misplaced,
      and possibly dangerously so. The court cannot step into the shoes of the
      accused and decide, on the basis of his knowledge, that an informant will
      not be identified. I need only mention that the accused may know that only
      some very small circle of persons, perhaps only one, may know an apparently
      innocuous fact that is mentioned in the document. The privilege is a hallowed
      one, and it should be respected scrupulously.</span></p>

    courts have recognized that even the smallest details may provide an accused
    person with all he or she needs to identify the informer:  see <i>R. v. Garofoli</i> (1990),
    60 C.C.C. (3d) 161 at 194 (S.C.C.); <i>R. v. Parmar </i>(1987), 34 C.C.C.

    J. quoted a portion of the passage from McEachern C.J.B.C.’s reasons quoted
    above and observed at para 16 that “[a]<span style='color:black'> detail
    as innocuous as the time of the telephone call may be sufficient to permit
    identification. In such circumstances, courts must exercise great care not
    to unwittingly deprive informers of the privilege which the law accords to

    do not agree with the suggestion that because<i> Leipert </i>dealt with anonymous
    informers it has limited application to the facts of this case.  An anonymous
    informer could be anyone.  Given the precise details given to the police
    by the informer in the present case, the pool of potential informers is very
    limited. In my view, this called for heightened caution when it came to editing. <i>Leipert</i> does
    not eliminate the possibility of editing, but holds, at para. 32, that where </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>it is impossible
    to determine which details of the information provided by an informer will
    or will not result in that person's identity being revealed, then none of

    my view, the trial judge erred in concluding that
    “the phrase ‘tends to identify the confidential informant’ means something
    more than ‘narrows the pool of people who have the same characteristics or
    “identifiers””.  There are very few people who could be capable of giving
    the highly precise and specific tip this informer provided.  There is a significant
    risk on the facts of this case that revealing slightest detail about the
    informer could serve to permit the respondent to identify who the informer
    is.  In my view, the trial judge’s order requiring disclosure of the edited
    documents risked violating informer privilege in a manner that was contrary
    to the established jurisprudence on informer privilege.</p>
