      the Society had received. She made an order under s. 13 of the </span><i>OSPCAA</i> for

    four orders. She authorized a full herd assessment of the sheep by a veterinarian,
    including examination for internal and external parasites, and recommendations
    by the veterinarian relating to shelter (shade), methods of confinement,
    and feeding. She also authorized a full health examination by a veterinarian
    of one Shetland horse.  Mr. Bevan decided to appeal these orders.</p>

      Agent Bluhm went to the house, then knocked on the door and there wasn’t

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>THE WITNESS:  They’re not meant

      shed their wool and were extremely hungry. They were attempting to graze
      even though the grass was very, very short. I described it as golf course
      length grass.</span></p>

      didn’t see adequate food for them; water was an issue. There was just,
      I believe we just found one bucket or one pail of water. The length of
      the hair coats or the wool coat of the majority of the animals. They were
      tatted, manure had gathered around the backs of some of the sheep. The
      premises was very cluttered with debris, machinery, implements, et cetera.
      The majority of these sheep had horns. My concern was that they could in
      fact become entrapped or caught in machinery with these horns and suffer
      injury to themselves. I just, I felt in general that they weren’t being
      properly cared for and I didn’t feel that this was a healthy environment

      Bevan appealed both the July 2, 2003 compliance order and the July 25,
      2003 removal order. The appeal was heard by the Animal Care Review Board
      over the course of fourteen days in late 2003. In a decision released on
      December 24, 2003, the board upheld, with minor variations, the compliance
      order. The board also affirmed the removal order:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Agent Bluhm had a legitimate basis
      for issuing the Notice of Removal under paragraph (c) of 14(1), that is,
      non-compliance with her July 2, 2003 Order. According to Agent Bluhm’s
      and Dr. Fisk’s observation on July 25, 2003, the debris had not been removed,
      there was no evidence of adequate water, adequate shelter had not been
      provided for all of the sheep, and the appellant had not provided her with
      the requested veterinarian’s written report. In short, there had been no
      substantial, if any, compliance with the Section 13(1) Order of July 2,
      2003. The Board takes compliance with Section 13(1) Orders very seriously,
      as it is the basis for achieving the purpose of the <i>Act</i>, which is
      to relieve an animal of its distress.</span></p>

    Owen Sound, Langdon J. dismissed Mr. Bevan’s appeal. He affirmed both the

    the appeal judge rejected Mr. Bevan’s contention that the Certificate of
    a Veterinarian signed by Dr. Fisk was a false document because Dr. Fisk examined
    only one of the sixteen animals. The appeal judge concluded that Dr. Fisk’s
    examination was “a sufficient examination” and, accordingly, his certificate
    was not “in any way a false document.”</p>

      only one tethered sheep. He had not examined the other fifteen sheep, the

      do not accept that, in the context of a statute whose stated object, per
      s. 3, is “to facilitate and provide for the prevention of cruelty to animals
      and their protection and relief therefrom”, the concept of examination
      should be defined in as narrow or pinched a fashion as that proposed by
      the appellant.</span></p>

      Langdon responded to the appellant’s proposed definition of the statutory
      words
    “to examine” in this way:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The requirement for the veterinarian “to
      examine” the animal does not invariably require a physical, hands-on examination
      of every single animal. What constitutes an examination will vary according
      to the circumstances of the case. For instance, a veterinarian might not
      need to examine even one animal
    “hands-on”, if he saw a herd trapped in an enclosure that was subject to
    be flooded such that the animals might drown. In determining what examination
    occurred, I will not refer to Dr.&nbsp;Fisk’s observations of the animals
    later on the same day. Clearly the statute speaks to an examination <i>before</i> removal.
    The examination is sufficient if the veterinarian has personally made observations
    that lead him reasonably to conclude that the health and well-being of the
    animal necessitates its removal. In making this decision, it is not unreasonable
    for the veterinarian to take into account reliable information that he or
    she has already received, for instance, from the Society’s inspector. Nevertheless,
    the fundamental aspect of the examination is that it must include the personal
    observation of the veterinarian. [Emphasis in original.]</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      endorse this analysis, which, in my view, is grounded in a proper respect
      for the object of the statute, fairness to the interests of animals and
      their owners, and common sense. Bearing in mind that a veterinarian may
      have to deal with large herds of animals or flocks of fowl in distress,
      or with difficult or dangerous animals, it is unreasonable to require a ‘hands-on’ examination
      or visual inspection of each animal about which the Society has a concern.</span></p>

      also agree with the appeal judge’s assessment of the evidence in this case.
      The appeal judge took into account a number of factors, including Dr. Fisk’s
      close examination of one sheep, his visual observation of the condition
      and behaviour of the remaining sheep, the conditions in which he could
      see the animals being kept, the reliable information he had concerning
      the animals on the farm, previous orders that had not been complied with,
      and Mr. Bevan’s interference with the examination. This led Dr. Fisk to
      the conclusion that the environment in which <i>all</i> the animals were
      kept was unhealthy, the animals were not properly cared for, and, therefore,
      their removal was necessary. The appeal judge determined that Dr. Fisk’s
      conclusion was reasonable. I agree.</span></p>
