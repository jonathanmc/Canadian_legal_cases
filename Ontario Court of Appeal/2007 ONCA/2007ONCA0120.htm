    deceased, Zahid Iqbal, was beaten to death by two men wielding baseball bats
    as he walked to his car in the parking garage of his
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Brampton apartment building on November 20, 2002. At trial, both appellants
    conceded that they are guilty of manslaughter. Further, there was no dispute
    that Muhammad planned to assault Iqbal. The contested issues were whether
    the appellants intended to kill Iqbal and, if they did, whether the killing
    was planned and deliberate, and if it was, whether Naveed was in on the plan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants relied, in part, on the testimony of a Crown witness, Suhail Qaiser,
    who accompanied them to the scene but remained in the car during the beating.
    According to Qaiser, prior to the incident Muhammad told Qaiser that he was
    going to beat someone up and break someone’s legs and immediately after the
    incident Muhammad said he kicked his ass, he broke his leg. Qaiser also testified
    that on the night of the beating after he told Muhammad the victim had died,
    Muhammad said, “I don’t mean to kill him. I just went there, you know, and
    break his leg. Somehow, you know, hit him on the head; he die.”</p>

    also relied on Qaiser’s testimony that Muhammad was the clear leader and
    that neither he nor Naveed knew of Muhammad’s plans prior to the attack.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Muhammad
    raised one issue on appeal. He submitted that since none of the evidence
    at trial pointed to a planned and deliberate murder as opposed to an assault,
    even when considered cumulatively, the Crown’s evidence against him of planning
    and deliberation was insufficient to support a verdict of first degree murder.
    We disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was ample evidence at trial to support the conclusion that Muhammad planned
    to attack Iqbal. For example, the evidence indicated that Muhammad contacted
    or attempted to contact Iqbal by telephone repeatedly between August and
    November 2002; that he had directions to Iqbal’s apartment in his bedroom;
    that he was involved in purchasing both baseball bats used in the attack
    shortly before the incident; that he rented a second car on November 20,
    2002 and had Qaiser drive his (Muhammad’s) car to Brampton; that he, Naveed
    and Qaiser, went to Brampton in the morning on November 20, 2002 and drove
    by Iqbal’s apartment several times prior to the attack; and that he was familiar
    with the layout of the parking garage and instructed Naveed and Qaiser to
    place the bats in garbage bins immediately prior to the incident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to this evidence, there was evidence demonstrating that the beating
    involved a minimum of four blows to the head and was over in seconds. Further,
    an eyewitness to the attack described seeing two men with bats walking casually
    and then starting to run. The eyewitness saw one of the men hold his bat
    over his head and then strike down at the person lying on the ground and
    hit him in the face. As a result of the attack, Iqbal’s face was crushed
    and his brain was pulpified. Moreover, all of his injuries were located between
    the root of his nose and the top of his head.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    there was some evidence at trial indicating that Muhammad understood Iqbal
    was or had been his sister’s boyfriend but that Iqbal planned to marry a
    woman in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    New Jersey. Finally, the Crown tendered evidence of various telephone intercepts
    and electronic probes. In one of the intercepts, Muhammad told his older
    brother, “the crime was committed very brutally” and
    “we tried to kill him fairly”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
    Qaiser’s evidence of Muhammad’s statements indicating he planned only to
    assault Iqbal, in our view, it was open to the jury to infer that Muhammad
    planned and deliberated Iqbal’s murder. In particular, the combined effect
    of the evidence that Muhammad stalked the deceased, the suddenness and brutality
    of the attack, the fact that Iqbal suffered no injuries to any part of his
    body other than his head, the evidence of a possible motive and Muhammad’s
    statement to his older brother, “we tried to kill him fairly” was sufficient
    to support a verdict of first degree murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Muhammad’s
    appeal is accordingly dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Naveed Malik’s Appeal</b> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Naveed
    raised five issues on appeal. We did not call on the Crown to respond to
    Naveed’s claims that the trial judge erred in admitting evidence of Iqbal’s
    statements to a co-worker that he planned to marry a woman named Malik; in
    failing to instruct the jury in accordance with the principles set out in <i>R.
    v. W.(D.)</i> (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.) and to relate that instruction
    to potentially exculpatory evidence; and in leaving the offence of first
    degree murder with the jury vis-à-vis Naveed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the trial judge made no error in relying on the innocuous character
    of Iqbal’s statements and the circumstances in which they were made to find
    that there was a sufficient circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness to
    justify their admission. Moreover, there was other evidence introduced at
    the trial tending to support the reliability of these statements. In the
    light of <i>R. v. Khelawon</i>, 2006 SCC 57, the existence of that evidence
    supports the trial judge’s ruling.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither
    appellant testified at trial. However, given that aspects of Qaiser’s evidence
    and a videotaped statement were capable of supporting Naveed’s position that
    he was guilty only of manslaughter, in our view, it would have been preferable
    had the trial judge given the jury a modified <i>W.(D.)</i> instruction.
    Nevertheless, the trial judge provided a proper reasonable doubt instruction
    and also instructed the jury that conflicting evidence is capable of creating
    a reasonable doubt. In these circumstances, a <i>W.(D.)</i> instruction was
    not mandatory. Moreover, we see no air of reality to Naveed’s claim that
    the jury would not have understood that they were obliged to convict him
    of a lesser offence if they accepted the evidence exculpating him of first
    degree murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for Naveed’s claim that the trial judge erred in leaving first degree murder
    with the jury and that the verdict of first degree murder is unreasonable
    vis-à-vis him, in our view, there was sufficient evidence to support the
    verdict.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    particular, there was evidence indicating Naveed was present when the baseball
    bats were purchased, when his brother rented a second car and when the three
    men travelled to Brampton on November 20, 2002, passed by Iqbal’s apartment
    several times and finally attended at the parking area to carry out the attack.
    On Muhammad’s instructions, he and Qaiser hid the baseball bats in a garbage
    bin immediately prior to the attack. According to Qaiser, soon after hiding
    the baseball bats Naveed called to Muhammad, “come, come, he’s here”. Naveed
    and Muhammad then retrieved the bats, walked casually at first and then began
    to run towards Iqbal. When the evidence of these facts is combined with the
    swiftness and brutality of the beating, the lack of injuries to any part
    of Iqbal’s body other than his head, and evidence indicating that Naveed
    knew his sister had a relationship with Iqbal, in our view, there was sufficient
    evidence to support a verdict of first degree murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    fourth issue raised by Naveed is that the trial judge erred in failing to
    grant his severance motion. Moreover, having refused that motion, the trial
    judge further erred in failing to provide the jury with a sufficient caution
    against using statements made by Muhammad against Naveed and, in particular,
    in failing to properly explain the limited circumstances in which a statement
    referred to by Crown counsel in his closing address could be used against
    Naveed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    reject Naveed’s claim that this was an appropriate case to depart from the
    presumption that co-accused should be tried together. He relies primarily
    on what he says was the extreme prejudice arising from certain intercept
    evidence that was admissible only against Muhammad. However, although the
    intercept evidence was not admissible against Naveed, it was admissible to
    demonstrate that Muhammad committed a planned and deliberate murder. Since
    it was the Crown’s theory that Naveed joined in Muhammad’s plan, proving
    that Muhammad had a plan would be an important element of the Crown’s case
    against Naveed even if a severance were granted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, in our view, this was a case in which any potential prejudice
    arising from the risk that the jury would misuse the intercept evidence could
    be cured by proper jury instructions. Further, based on the evidence we have
    pointed to in relation to Naveed’s claim that the verdict against him was
    unreasonable, we do not accept his submission that the Crown’s case against
    him was marginal or that there was such an imbalance in the evidence that
    a severance was required.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for Naveed’s submission that the trial Crown invited the jury to misuse the
    evidence of Muhammad’s intercepted statements against Naveed and that the
    trial judge failed to caution the jury adequately against such misuse, we
    note that the trial judge instructed the jury repeatedly, both in general
    and by reference to specific statements, that out-of-court utterances made
    by one of the appellants were not admissible against the other.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    we accept the Crown’s submission on appeal that further clarification of
    the circumstances in which the jury could use a statement referred to by
    Crown counsel in his closing address against Naveed would not have inured
    to Naveed’s benefit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial Crown’s comments were to the effect that Muhammad said he was going
    to buy a bat for Naveed at a point when Muhammad, Qaiser and Naveed were
    together in the car. Shortly thereafter, the trial Crown asked rhetorically, “Why
    would Muhammad Malik be buying a bat for Naveed Malik on November 16<sup>th</sup>?
    Because Naveed Malik was in on it.” The trial Crown also questioned whether
    Qaiser’s evidence that neither he nor Naveed knew about the plan to kill
    Iqbal made sense in the light of Muhammad’s statement and the purchase of
    the bats. Naveed says the trial judge erred by failing to instruct the jury
    that they could only use this statement against him if they were satisfied
    that it was said in his presence and that he heard it and in some way adopted
    it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    Qaiser’s testimony on the issue, in our view, the likely inference was that
    Naveed was in the car when the statement was made. Moreover, given the evidence
    that Naveed went on two subsequent shopping excursions to purchase bats,
    participated in hiding the bats at the parking garage, and used one of the
    bats to strike Iqbal in the head in a swift and brutal attack, in our view,
    there was a compelling inference that Naveed was aware of Muhammad’s plan
    to kill Iqbal even without the statement. Repeating these facts so that the
    jury could determine whether Naveed acted on the statement would not have
    inured to his benefit. Moreover, we note that the statement itself suggested
    nothing about whether there was a plan to kill Iqbal as opposed to simply
    assault him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    fifth issue raised by Naveed is that the trial judge erred in his instructions
    to the jury on aiding a first degree murder. Naveed says that, on the facts
    of this case, it would not be unreasonable to infer that he did not realize
    Muhammad was planning to kill Iqbal until he saw Muhammad strike the first
    blow and that it was only at that point that he decided, on impulse, to participate
    in the killing. While he acknowledges that the instructions given by the
    trial judge on aiding were legally correct, he submits that, in the circumstances
    of this case, the trial judge was obliged to go further and instruct the
    jury explicitly that to find him guilty of first degree murder as an aider,
    the jury had to be satisfied that he knew of the existence of and the contents
    of the plan in advance of the murder. Further, Naveed submits that two questions
    the jury asked suggest they were struggling with this very issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not accept these submissions. The Crown’s theory was that Naveed was in
    on a plan to murder Iqbal from the time the baseball bats were purchased.
    As we have noted, the evidence at trial indicated that the entire attack
    was over in seconds. In these circumstances, in our view, the jury instructions
    on aiding and abetting were entirely adequate. There is no air of reality
    to the suggestion that the jury found Naveed guilty of first degree murder
    by concluding that Naveed only realized Muhammad was planning to kill Iqbal
    after Muhammad struck the first blow. We do not accept the submission that
    the jury’s requests to have repeated the trial judge’s explanations of “planned
    and deliberate” and of “aiders with respect to planned and deliberate” suggest
    that they were considering this hypothetical possibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we would not give effect to this ground of appeal. Naveed’s appeal is therefore
    dismissed.</p>
