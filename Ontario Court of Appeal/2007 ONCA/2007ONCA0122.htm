  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment
      of Justice James M. Farley of the Superior Court of Justice dated March
      16, 2006</span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>.</span></h4>
  <h2>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>     The application
    judge dismissed the appellant’s claim for a declaration that the respondent
    has a duty to defend the appellant in relation to an action commenced by
    Bruno Appliance and Furniture, Inc. The respondent’s policy of insurance
    provides coverage with respect to: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>all sums which the INSURED shall become legally
    obligated to pay as DAMAGES arising out of a CLAIM, provided the liability
    of the INSURED is the result of an error, omission or negligent act in the
    performance of or the failure to perform PROFESSIONAL SERVICES for others.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under
    the terms of the policy, Professional Services
    “means the practice of the Law of Canada … and specifically, those services
    performed, or which ought to have been performed, by or on behalf of an INSURED
    in such INSURED’S capacity as a lawyer and as a member of the Law Society
    of Upper Canada … and …
    include … those services for which the INSURED is responsible as a lawyer
    arising out of such INSURED’S activity as a trustee …”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the policy also provides an exclusion with respect to “any CLAIM in any way
    arising out of an insured providing investment advice and/or services, including
    without limitation, investment advice and/or services relating to or arising
    out of a business, commercial or real property investment unless as a direct
    consequence of the performance of PROFESSIONAL SERVICES.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    dismissing the appellant’s claim the application judge noted that the Bruno
    statement of claim does not include any explicit allegation of a retainer
    for legal services. Further, although he recognized that the mere possibility
    that a claim within the policy may succeed is sufficient to impose a duty
    to defend, in terms of any advice Bruno received from the appellant, the
    application judge concluded that the only reasonable interpretation of Bruno’s
    claim is that Bruno “wanted to determine the soundness and safety (in the
    sense of return of capital and income thereon) of this investment scheme.” Finally,
    the application judge concluded that it would not be a reasonable interpretation
    of the statement of claim to find that the appellant was providing any legal
    services to Bruno in connection with holding the funds to be invested in
    its trust account.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is implicit in the application judge’s reasons that he concluded that the
    allegations relied on by Bruno in its statement of claim fall within the
    exclusion in the policy relating to providing investment advice and/or services. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s primary argument on appeal is that the application judge erred
    in failing to recognize that on a plain reading of the exclusion clause the
    exception contained within it is not restricted to circumstances in which
    investment advice or services were provided by the insured as a direct consequence
    of the performance of legal services for the plaintiff in the underlying
    action. In particular, the appellant contends that Bruno’s claim against
    it is founded, at least in part, on the fact that the appellant provided
    legal advice and services to the parties with whom Bruno invested by preparing
    joint venture documents and by using its trust account as a vehicle for receipt
    and distribution of the funds to be invested. The appellant accordingly submits
    that the portions of Bruno’s claim alleging that the appellant failed to
    properly monitor its trust account and to follow Bruno’s instructions concerning
    the release of funds from its trust account fall squarely within the exception
    to the exclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree. While use of a trust account can constitute professional services,
    based on the claim as pleaded, we see no basis for concluding that the use
    of the trust account in this case was anything other than an investment service.
    As noted, the trust account was merely a vehicle for receipt and distribution
    of the funds to be invested. In our view, the fact that a law firm’s trust
    account is used as an investment vehicle does not of itself amount to the
    performance of Professional Services; nor does it make misuse of the investment
    vehicle a “direct consequence of the performance of Professional Services”.
    Accordingly, based on the claim as pleaded use of the trust account fell
    within the investment services exclusion in the policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    even if the exception to the exclusion clause can extend to professional
    services performed for someone other than the plaintiff in the underlying
    action, on the facts of this case, Bruno’s claim cannot be characterized
    as being a direct consequence of the performance of professional services
    by the appellant. As noted by the application judge, at its core, Bruno’s
    claim amounts to an assertion that it approached the appellant because it
    wanted what was essentially business advice concerning the safety and security
    of the investment. Having satisfied itself on that score, it proceeded with
    the investment. In these circumstances, its claim for losses cannot be said
    to be a “direct consequence” of any prior professional services the appellant
    may have provided to the promoters of the investment in setting up the structure
    of the investment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs
    on a partial indemnity scale fixed at $12,500.00 inclusive of G.S.T. and
    applicable disbursements.</p>
