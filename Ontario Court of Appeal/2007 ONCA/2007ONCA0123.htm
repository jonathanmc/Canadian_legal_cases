    Ottawa dance club.  The appellant raised the defences of self-defence (s.
    34 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>), preventing the commission of an offence
    (s. 27), preventing an assault (s. 37) and provocation (s. 232), and argued

    murder. </p>

    appellant appeals that ruling and raises two other grounds of appeal: (1)
    that the trial judge erred in his instructions and recharge on post-offence
    conduct; and (2) that the trial judge erred in his instructions regarding
    provocation.  All other grounds of appeal were abandoned by counsel in her

    we give effect to any of the alleged errors, the respondent submits that

    number of witnesses present at the scene testified at the trial and gave
    varying versions of the events leading to the death of the victim.  For the

    the necessary background.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant took a concealed knife with him into a crowded teen dance club.
    The appellant’s cousin, Zacherie Belance, was at the club that evening.  The
    appellant lived in the same house as his cousin and they had a brother-like
    relationship.
     Zacherie had told the appellant about the event, although the two did not
    go to the club together.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Zacherie
    was seventeen years old at the time.  He is small in stature: at the time
    of the incident he stood 5’ 6” tall and weighed 121 pounds.  Zacherie accidentally
    bumped into a friend of the victim on the dance floor.  A scuffle ensued
    in which Zacherie appears to have been the aggressor.  The victim, Oladapo
    Agoro, who was there with three friends, all of who were larger than Zacherie,
    intervened.  There was some evidence that Agoro and Zacherie pushed each
    other and that Agoro punched Zacherie. </p>

    appellant approached Agoro and shouted “[w]hat the fuck are you doing?  That’s
    my cousin!”, at which point Agoro turned from Zacherie to the appellant.  Some
    pushing between the victim and the appellant ensued.  The appellant testified
    that Agoro prevented the appellant from going to his cousin.  The appellant
    took out his knife and stabbed the victim four times in the lower abdomen,
    inflicting wounds from which the victim soon died.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    appellant testified that the three men with Agoro “looked like enforcers” and
    that they looked “mad and angry”.  There was evidence relating to the significant
    size differential between Zacherie and Agoro: the latter was over 6’ tall
    and weighed approximately 163 pounds. Agoro’s three friends were all larger
    than Zacherie; two of them were approximately the same size as Agoro. </p>

    defence will possess an air of reality if a properly instructed jury, acting
    reasonably, could base an acquittal on it: <i>R. v. Cinous</i> (2002), 162
    C.C.C. (3d) 129 at para. 83 (S.C.C.).  The test was defined by Cory J. in <i>R.
    v. Osolin</i> (1993), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at 531(S.C.C.): “The term ‘air of
    reality’ simply means that the trial judge must determine if the evidence
    put forward is such that, if believed, a reasonable jury properly charged
    could have acquitted.” In <i>R. v. Kong </i>(2006), 211 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.)
    the Supreme Court of Canada adopted the dissenting judgment of Wittman J.A.
    in the Alberta Court of Appeal (2005), 200 C.C.C. (3d) 19, holding that a
    trial judge erred in removing a defence from the jury on the ground that
    the evidence failed to establish an air of reality.  At para. 175, Wittman
    J.A. stated: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Applying the
    air of reality test requires a trial judge to consider the totality of the
    evidence, and assumes the evidence relied upon by the accused to be true.  The
    evidential foundation can be found or inferred from the testimony of the
    accused or any witnesses, the factual circumstances of the case, or any other
    evidence on the record.  <i>The trial judge is not to make findings of fact,
    weigh evidence, determine credibility, draw determinate inferences, or even
    assess the likelihood of success.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    a like vein, in <i>Cinous</i>, <i>supra</i>, McLachlin C.J.C. and Bastarache
    J. stated at para. 87: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>The trial judge must review the evidence and determine whether,
    if believed, it could permit a properly instructed jury acting reasonably
    to acquit.  It follows that the trial judge cannot consider issues of credibility.  <i>Further,
    the trial judge must not weigh evidence, make findings of fact, or draw determinate
    factual inferences.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    rationale behind the limited screening function performed by the “air of
    reality” rule is that allowing defences to go to the jury without an evidential
    foundation invites verdicts not supported by the evidence and serves only
    to confuse the jury: see <i>Cinous</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 50.  </p>

    agree with the respondent that on the appellant’s own evidence, there was
    no air of reality to the defence of self-defence.  The appellant did not
    claim that he stabbed the victim to protect himself, but rather to protect
    his cousin and at trial, his counsel conceded that there was an inadequate
    evidential basis for trial judge to put the defence of self-defence to the
    jury.</p>

    trial judge identified three elements of the s. 37 defence: (i) the force
    must be used to defend the accused or someone under his protection; (ii)
    the force must be used to prevent the assault or the repetition of it; and
    (iii) the use of force must not be excessive having regard to the nature
    of the assault the force was used to prevent.  The trial judge ruled that
    there was evidence of both the first and second elements, but found that
    there was no air of reality to the third element as the force used by the
    appellant was excessive.</p>

    there is much to be said for the argument that the issue of proportionality
    of force should have been left with the jury, I need not pronounce on the
    issue, because as I set out below, a new trial is required on the basis of
    the trial judge’s jury charge and recharge on the issues of post-offence
    conduct and provocation.  </p>

    three essential elements of the defence of provocation are: (i) a wrongful
    act or insult that would deprive an ordinary person of self-control; (ii)
    the accused was actually deprived of self-control; and (iii) the accused
    reacted to the wrongful act or insult quickly and before there was time for
    his passions to cool: see <i>R. v. Hill</i> (1986) 25 C.C.C. (3d) 322 (S.C.C.); <i>R.
    v. Thibert</i> (1996), 104 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).  In my view, there was
    evidence in front of the trial judge sufficient for him to find an air of
    reality on each of the three elements. </p>

    assaulted and to be in danger, provided evidence sufficient to meet this
    air of reality threshold.  This is supported  by the  trial judge’s finding

    see any wounds on Zacherie before fighting with the victim, a juror could
    reasonably focus on the appellant’s dissociation from the immediate effect

    reaction to the harm he thought Zacherie was facing.</p>

    to provide an air of reality to this defence.  In reaching this conclusion,
    I am fortified by the fact at no time did the trial Crown suggest that the
    defence of provocation should not be put to the jury.  As neither the trial
    Crown nor the trial judge thought it appropriate to take provocation away
    from the jury on the basis of an insufficient evidentiary foundation, I would
    be reluctant to do so in a close case such as this when the point is raised
    not as a substantive ground of appeal, but as a response to an otherwise
    meritorious appeal relating to the trial judge’s responses to questions from
    the jury charge relating to that very defence.</p>

    appellant raises a number of points in relation to the trial judge’s instruction
    on the defence of provocation.  It is only necessary for me to consider one
    point, namely, his answer to the jury’s question relating to unanimity.  After
    some period of deliberation, the jury posed four questions requiring clarification
    in relation to provocation:</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;'>1.   Please review the definition of provocation; </p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;'>2.   Please define self-control; </p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;'>3.   Please define ordinary person; </p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;
'>4.   Do we have to be unanimous in deciding when the ordinary person loses
    self-control?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge answered the fourth question in relation to unanimity as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Let me put it
    another way to you.  You must, at some point, on the question of provocation,
    be unanimous.  The bottom line is that you have to be unanimous, but you
    do not have to be unanimous on every question.  Some of you may feel that,
    for instance, that the Crown has convinced you beyond a reasonable doubt
    on question one, wrongful act or insult.  A number of you may not feel that
    you have been convinced beyond a reasonable doubt.  Then, a group may feel
    that the ordinary person test, but the Crown has convinced you beyond a reasonable
    doubt or the other way around.  In fact, that – you know, it applies both
    ways.  You have got to be unanimous on – that the Crown has convinced you
    that there – beyond a reasonable doubt that there is no provocation or you
    have got to be unanimous that it has not, but you do not have to be unanimous
    on every question, but at some point, as you’re answering these different
    questions, you must achieve unanimity and so, you don’t necessarily have
    to be unanimous in deciding when an ordinary person loses self-control.  In
    fact, that sort of putting it – establishing for you a much, too difficult
    standard because it’s not for you to decide when an ordinary person loses
    self-control.  What you must do is look at the facts of this case and say, “On
    the facts of this case, am I satisfied or has the Crown satisfied me beyond
    a reasonable doubt that an ordinary person would not lose his self-control?”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>And so, as you go down in answering the four questions, the
    bottom line is, at some point, you have to be unanimous, but you do not have
    to be unanimous in answering each and every question. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>You know, as an example, if you were unanimous on the –well,
    I do not want to start going through the process, but on the first question,
    if you find or have a reasonable doubt whether there was a wrongful act or
    insult, then, you have got to go on to the next question.  On the other hand,
    if you find you’re satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that there was no
    wrongful act or insult, that ends the matter at that point.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    the trial judge was undoubtedly trying to assist the jury in answering these
    questions, I can only conclude that his instruction was unclear and confusing
    and that it did not provide the jury with the assistance it required.  At
    best, the jury was left in the dark as to how to proceed if it disagreed
    with respect to one of the discrete elements of provocation.  At worst, there
    is a substantial risk that the jury could have taken the trial judge to be
    saying that it would have to convict the appellant unless it was unanimous
    in his favour on all three elements of provocation.  The jury might well
    have understood the trial judge’s instruction and statement that “the bottom
    line is, at some point, you have to be unanimous” as taking away its right
    to disagree. </p>

    conduct might have some probative value in determining his state of mind:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>If you find
    that what was said or done afterwards is consistent with his – that he had
    the necessary state of mind, in other words, that he meant to kill the victim,
    you may consider that evidence, together with all of the other evidence in
    reaching your verdict.  It’s up to you to consider that evidence, along with
    all of the other evidence in determining whether you’re satisfied beyond
    a reasonable doubt, if the accused had the state of mind and was not – if
    you’re satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he was not provoked in stabbing
    and killing the victim.</p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    instruction was given shortly before a break during which Crown counsel indicated
    to the trial judge that his instruction relating to post-offence conduct
    should not have been given as, on the facts of the case, it could not assist
    the jury in distinguishing between the guilty state of mind for manslaughter
    in the guilty state of mind required for second degree murder.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    the jury returned the trial judge gave the following instruction:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Because the
    only possible verdicts in this case are either guilty as charged, guilty
    of second degree murder, or not guilty of second degree murder, but guilty
    of manslaughter, what I said to you may have been confusing and I think I
    should correct that.  That, basically, that evidence would not be probative
    for state of mind at that level because of the nature of the only possible
    verdicts.  Where post-offence conduct, either what was said or what was done,
    may have some probative value or be helpful to you would be in determining
    possibly the credibility of the accused, Mr. Belance, and you’ll recall that
    both counsel have referred to that about, you know, what took place afterwards
    and I intend to review part of that with you later on when I look at the
    position taken by both parties.</p>

    my respectful view, the trial judge erred in his initial instruction relating
    to post-offence conduct and his attempted correction of this error fell well
    short of what was required to correct his earlier instruction.  The appellant
    admitted that he had stabbed the victim and it is well established that in
    such circumstances, post-offence conduct has no probative value in determining
    the intent of the accused: see <i>R. v. Archangioli</i> (1994), 87 C.C.C.
    (3d) 289 at 301 (S.C.C.).  While the trial judge recognized his error, his
    reinstruction failed to reverse the effect of his original comments to the
    jury in clear and understandable language.  His instruction relating to the
    bearing of post-offence conduct on credibility is confusing.  I agree with
    the submission that he should have clearly instructed the jury that the appellant’s
    post-offence conduct had no probative value as to the appellant’s state of
    mind and that he erred in failing to do so.</p>

    agree that the Crown’s case was strong and the defence far from compelling,
    I am not persuaded that this is a case for the curative proviso.  The Crown
