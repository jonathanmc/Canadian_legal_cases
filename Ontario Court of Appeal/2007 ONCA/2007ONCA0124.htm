    order at issue was made in the context of a proposed plan of arrangement
    of Hemosol Corp. and Hemosol L.P. (Hemosol) under the <i>Companies Creditors’ Arrangement
    Act,</i> R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36<i> </i>(CCAA).  The appellant, 2092248 (209),
    sought to enforce a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) against MDS Inc. and its
    assignee Catalyst Capital Group Inc.  MDS was the parent corporation and
    the first-ranking secured creditor of Hemosol.  The MOA relates to a conditional
    offer by 209 to purchase the assets of Hemosol and provides that 209 is to
    fund Hemosol during the CCAA process, this funding being subordinate to MDS’s
    security.  MDS later sold its debt position to Catalyst and Catalyst assumed
    all obligations of MDS under the MOA.</p>

    respondents move to quash the appeal on the ground that the order was made
    under the CCAA and that leave to appeal is required by CCAA, s. 13. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the proceeding before the motion judge and the decision under appeal
    were conducted and rendered under the CCAA within the meaning of s. 13 and
    therefore leave to appeal is required.  The notice of motion and the reasons
    of the motion judge explicitly state that the matter is a CCAA proceeding.  Directions
    were sought, amongst other things, to determine rights and requirements of
    voting in relation to the proposed plan of arrangement.  There was no independent
    originating process to justify any other conclusion.  The order determined
    rights arising under an agreement that arose out of and that was related
    entirely to the CCAA proceeding.  We agree that the order finally determines
    the rights of the parties, but we do not accept the submission that this
    characterization removes it from the ambit of the CCAA, s. 13 and the requirement
    for leave to appeal.  Accordingly, there is no appeal as of right and, unless
    leave to appeal is granted, the appeal must be quashed.</p>

    for leave to appeal. </p>

    agreement to purchase the assets of Hemosol was conditional upon 209 reaching
    a satisfactory agreement with ProMetic Biosciences Inc. (ProMetic) as to
    Hemosol’s licence to use certain intellectual property.  MDA agreed to extend
    the deadline in the MOA to September 18, 2006, but 209 failed to reach agreement
    with ProMedic by that date.  On September 21, 209 waived the ProMetic condition
    and asserted its right to conclude the MOA and purchase the assets of Hemosol.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Central
    to the motion judge’s decision rejecting 209’s claim that it was entitled
    to complete the MOA is a finding that 209 made a deliberate decision not
    to contact MDS to request an extension of the MOA beyond the September 18
    termination date and that 209 knew that MDS had not agreed to an extension.  The
    motion judge found that 209’s failure to seek an extension was fatal and
    that the MOA was no longer in effect after the last deadline agreed to by
    MDS ended on September 18.  The motions judge considered and rejected 209’s
    claim that MDS had waived the September 18 deadline or was estopped from
    relying on it.  He did not, however, explicitly deal with the principal submission
    advanced before us, namely that MDS’s silence in the face of 209’s continued
    payment under the MOA implies that MDS elected to waive 209’s breech.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    see no basis upon which to interfere with the motion judge’s findings that
    by failing to obtain an extension from MDS prior to the termination date,
    209’s right to under the MOA to purchase the assets of Hemosol expired.  Nor
    do we see any basis to interfere with his findings as to estoppel.  While
    the motions judge did not deal explicitly with the implied election point,
    in our view, that argument would be difficult to maintain in the face if
    his explicit finding that 209 was made aware that MDS was insisting upon
    the September 21deadline and had not agreed to any extension.  These are
    sophisticated commercial parties acting to maximize their commercial interests
    and the question of the deadline and the implications of MDS not agreeing
    to extend the deadline on 209’s rights were very much on the on the table.  In
    these circumstances, a court would be reluctant to imply that one party waived
    any of its legal rights.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    even assuming that 209 does raise an arguable ground of appeal on the election
    point, we are not persuaded that 209 can meet the test for leave to appeal.
    209’s argument rests on well accepted legal principles.  The only issue is
    whether 209 can bring the facts of this case within those legal principles.  In
    our view, there is no point that transcends the interests of these parties
    and the point on appeal has insufficient significance to the practice to
    warrant granting leave to appeal.</p>

    inclusive. </p>
