  <h2>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raises two main issues on appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    she claims that the trial judge erred in failing to restrict herself to the
    issue of whether the appellant was entitled to move. We reject this submission.
    The original application of the respondent father was an application for
    custody or, in the alternative, primary care and control of the child. Similarly,
    the application of the respondent grandparents as  third parties was an application
    for custody. For reasons that we will explain, in our view, there were facts
    and circumstances in addition to the appellant’s proposed move that justified
    the trial judge dealing with the question of custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellant claims that, in the light of the pre-existing consent order
    for joint custody under provincial legislation, the trial judge erred in
    dealing with the custody claims in the divorce application as a proceeding <i>de
    novo</i> rather than as a variation application. The appellant also asserts
    that the respondents failed to establish a material change in circumstances
    justifying a change in custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree that it would have been preferable had the trial judge explicitly addressed
    the issue of whether this matter should be dealt with as a proceeding <i>de
    novo</i> or as a variation application. However, in our view, even if it
    was necessary that the trial judge treat this matter as a variation application,
    it is implicit in her reasons that she found that the threshold of material
    change in circumstances was satisfied. For example, the trial judge found
    that even though the appellant acknowledged that joint custody requires joint
    decision making by the parents the appellant’s evidence demonstrated that
    she had not engaged in that exercise in relation to the two issues of great
    significance in the trial. Those issues were tutoring for the child and the
    appellant’s proposed move to Madsen. Moreover, the trial judge made an express
    finding that the appellant was behaving as if she were the sole custodial
    parent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    subsequent to the order made under provincial legislation, the mother formed
    a troubled relationship with a man who had a serious problem with alcohol.  The
    trial judge also found that until this proceeding was commenced, the child
    was spending an increasing amount of time each year with the respondent grandparents
    to the point that the trial judge questioned whether the appellant continued
    to be the primary caregiver. Fourth, following commencement of this proceeding
    the appellant curtailed the grandparents’ time with the child, giving rise
    to the trial judge’s conclusions that the appellant does not recognize the
    importance of the child’s relationship with his grandparents and was engaging  in
    a pattern of conduct of putting her own interests first. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the trial judge carefully and thoroughly considered the best interests
    of the child. We see no basis for interfering with her conclusions or with
    her order awarding custody of the child to the respondent grandparents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs
    of the appeal are to the respondents fixed at $7,500.00 inclusive of disbursements
    and applicable G.S.T.</p>
