  <h3><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Background</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time of trial, the appellant was 50 years of age and the respondent 49.  They
    had been married for 28 years. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant had once been employed as a project superintendent for the York
    Region Housing Corporation.  However, the appellant’s only income for the
    twelve years preceding the trial was a CPP disability pension and disability
    payments under a private policy totalling about $22,884 annually.  Nonetheless,
    the trial judge found that the appellant earned, or was capable of earning,
    additional income from his construction work that he undertook despite any
    disability. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the respondent earned an annual income of approximately
    $36,000 from her employment at Honeywell Ltd.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time of trial, the elder of the parties’ two children was no longer dependent.  The
    younger child, Andrew, who was 16 years of age, was dependent and lived with
    the respondent.  The trial judge ordered the appellant to pay the respondent
    child support of $192.00 monthly, based upon the appellant’s combined disability
    income.  In addition, Andrew received, through his mother, a CPP child benefit,
    which amounted to approximately $200 monthly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    calculating the parties’ net family property, the trial judge ordered the
    respondent to pay the appellant an equalization payment of $7,893.75.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, the parties agree that the trial judge made relatively minor errors
    regarding both their incomes.  The appellant concedes that his salary in
    the year preceding trial was $22,884, rather than the $22,085 found by the
    trial judge, with the result that his child support obligation should be
    $201 monthly, instead of $192 monthly, as ordered by the trial judge.  As
    well, the parties concede that the evidence at trial established that the
    respondent’s base income is $37,000, not $36,000, and that the respondent
    additionally received approximately $8,000 in overtime earnings for the year
    prior to trial.</p>
  <h3><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Analysis</span></h3>
  <h3><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>1</span>.       <span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>CPP
      child benefit</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that his $201 monthly child support obligation should be
    reduced by the $200 CPP child benefit that arises out of the appellant’s
    CPP disability. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    several reasons, I agree with the courts that have considered and rejected
    the argument that the amount of the CPP child benefit should be credited
    against the child support otherwise owing.  See <i>Wadden v. Wadden</i>,
    [2000] B.C.J. No. 1287 (S.C.); <i>Huey v. Huey</i> (1991), 39 R.F.L. (3d)
    14 (Ont. Gen. Div.); <i>Williams v. Williams</i> (1995), 18 R.F.L. (4<sup>th</sup>)
    129 (Ont. Gen. Div.); <i>Corkum v. Corkum</i> (1997), 36 R.F.L. (4<sup>th</sup>)
    367 (N.S.S.C.); <i>Griffiths v. Griffiths</i> (1999), 45 R.F.L. (4<sup>th</sup>)
    353 (Alta. Q.B.); <i>Vickers v. Vickers</i> (2001), 201 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>)
    65 (N.S.C.A.); <i>Peterson v. Horan</i> (2006), 279 Sask. R. 94 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    if Parliament had intended to provide an offset of the child benefit against
    support, it would have provided for that result either in the <i>Federal
    Child Support Guidelines</i>, S.O.R./97-175 (the Guidelines), or in the <i>Canada
    Pension Plan</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-8 (the Act).  It did not do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the benefit is not income of the appellant in the sense that he redirects
    it to his son simply as a matter of convenience.  Instead, the Act treats
    the benefit as that of the child, not that of the contributor.  Paragraph
    44(1)(e) of the Act specifically provides that “a disabled contributor’s
    child benefit shall be paid to each child of a disabled contributor…”.  As
    well, an application for the benefit is not made by the parent, but by the
    parent “on behalf of” the child.  This is confirmed by s. 75, which provides
    that the benefit is payable directly to the child, unless the child is a
    minor, in which case the benefit is paid to the custodial parent.  The appellant
    has no entitlement to the benefit, he has no control over its payment, it
    is not taxable in his hands, and it is not included in his income for the
    purpose of calculating his child support obligation.  Accordingly, it should
    not be used to reduce the appellant’s obligation to pay support for his child. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    had Parliament intended the benefit to satisfy all or part of a contributor’s
    child support obligation, it could have crafted a scheme that provided an
    increased benefit for a contributor with a dependent child, rather than a
    separate child benefit.  Had it done so, the quantum of child support would
    have been calculated on the appellant’s gross income.  This, however, was
    not the scheme devised by Parliament.  See <i>Vickers, supra</i>, at para.
    12. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    the <i>Divorce Act, </i>R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2<sup>nd</sup> Supp.) mandates
    that child support orders must be made in accordance with the Guidelines.
    Support is calculated on the taxpayer’s <b>taxable</b> income, which does
    not include the child benefit.  The Guidelines do not provide for a reduction
    of Table support by the amount of the CPP child benefit and do not factor
    a minor child’s means into consideration, except in certain specific circumstances,
    none of which was raised in this proceeding.  The trial judge knew that Andrew
    was approaching the age of majority when his means could become relevant.
    However, when considered in the context of Andrew’s needs, and the financial
    circumstances of his parents, his receipt of the CPP child benefit would
    not operate to reduce the appellant’s child support obligation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would not give effect to this ground of appeal, except to vary the child
    support to $201 monthly, as conceded by the appellant.  In doing so, I note
    that while the quantum of the appellant’s income was at issue for the purpose
    of his claim for spousal support, it is not challenged for the purpose of
    child support.  This is consistent with the absence of a specific finding
    by the trial judge about the precise additional income generated by the appellant’s
    construction work. </p>
  <h3><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>2.         Spousal support</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge dismissed the appellant’s claim for spousal support.  The appellant
    challenges that dismissal on three bases.  First, he argues that the trial
    judge erred in finding that the appellant could earn additional income when
    any such income would only reduce his disability payments.  Second, the appellant
    argues that the trial judge erred in concluding that his needs were being
    met by his current partner.  Third, he argues that the trial judge erred
    in failing to take the respondent’s overtime income into account.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am not persuaded by these arguments. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regarding
    the appellant’s income, the trial judge found that the appellant’s income
    was not limited to his disability pensions.  The appellant does not challenge
    that factual finding, but argues that the trial judge failed to consider
    that his additional earnings would simply be applied by his private disability
    insurer to reduce his disability benefits, with the effect that his income
    would remain at $22,884.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge, however, was clearly alive to this issue when he found that
    the appellant was in fact earning <b>undeclared</b> money in addition to
    his disability benefits.  Undeclared income from his construction work (including
    dry walling, plumbing and electrical work) would not reduce the appellant’s
    benefits.  In addition, the appellant was unable to explain to the satisfaction
    of the trial judge the purpose for which he maintained a sole proprietorship
    as a “consultant.”  On the basis of this evidence, the trial judge was entitled
    to conclude that the appellant earned additional income that allowed him
    to provide for his own support.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    the trial judge clearly did not accept the appellant’s evidence about his
    disability.  He repeatedly cautioned the appellant, who was self-represented,
    to call medical evidence to support his claim, but the appellant declined
    to do so.  The trial judge was entitled to conclude that the appellant’s
    disability, said to be caused by a combination of fibromyalgia and depression,
    was contradicted by the direct evidence of his physical labour in construction.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, there was evidence before the trial judge from which he was entitled
    to conclude that the appellant was living well beyond his reported means
    by reason of his additional income and with the apparent support of his current
    partner.  For example, the appellant claimed automobile expenses for his
    leased car at approximately $700 monthly.  Such expenses simply did not make
    sense for a man in his allegedly difficult financial circumstances.  In addition,
    the appellant admitted that he travelled abroad with his current partner,
    including recent trips to
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    California and
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Hungary</st1:country-region>
    , vacations that would not have been available on his professed income.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellant argues that the respondent’s income was not $37,000, but $44,051,
    a figure that included the respondent’s overtime earnings in the year prior
    to trial.  However, at trial, the parties based their positions on the respondent’s
    income without overtime and the documentary evidence did not show a consistent
    pattern of overtime.  Moreover, the respondent was not cross-examined about
    whether she regularly earned overtime income and there was no evidence that
    overtime work would continue to be available to her.  Nor did the appellant
    raise the respondent’s overtime earnings during his submissions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if the trial judge erred regarding the quantum of the respondent’s income,
    which I do not accept, the trial judge was correct in any event to take into
    account the respondent’s expenses in supporting the parties’ child, with
    only minimal child support from the appellant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    on the basis of the direct evidence about the appellant’s construction income
    and his lifestyle, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that the appellant
    was not in need of support.  Furthermore, in dismissing the appellant’s claim
    for spousal support, the trial judge specifically considered the parties’
    respective incomes, the respondent’s obligations to the parties’ child, the
    appellant’s disability income, his other undeclared income and his underemployment.  I
    see no basis to interfere with the dismissal of the appellant’s claim for
    spousal support. </p>
  <h3><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>3.         Equalization payment</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant relies on a notice of assessment filed at trial to establish an
    error regarding the trial judge’s quantification of the equalization payment.  While
    the date on the notice of assessment is 2003, and that was the date noted
    by the trial judge, the notice actually relates to a 2001 taxation assessment
    of $2,018.69 of income taxes.  Accordingly, the quantum of the equalization
    payment payable by the respondent to the appellant should be increased to
    take account of this error, resulting in an adjustment of the equalization
    payment to $8,902.92. </p>
  <h3>Result</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, I would allow the appeal in part, by varying paragraphs 3
    and 7 of the order below to provide for an equalization payment of $8,902.92
    and child support of $201 monthly.  I would otherwise dismiss the appeal.
    If the parties are pursuing costs, they may deliver brief written submissions
    not exceeding three pages.  The respondent’s submissions shall be delivered
    within 30 days from the release of these reasons and the appellant’s submissions
    within 15 days thereafter.</p>
