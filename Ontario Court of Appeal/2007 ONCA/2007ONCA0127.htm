  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr.&nbsp;Rankin
      was a managing director in the mergers and acquisitions group at RBC Dominion
      Securities (“DS”).  In this role, he advised various reporting issuers
      on confidential transactions.  He was responsible also for staffing DS’s
      transactions.  He received information about deals as they arose so that
      he could assign staff members appropriately.  He had considerable access
      to undisclosed information about several reporting issuers.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr.&nbsp;Rankin
      came to the attention of the OSC as a result of suspicious trades made
      by Daniel Duic, Mr.&nbsp;Rankin’s long-time close friend.  The charges
      relate to ten such trades completed by Mr.&nbsp;Duic, all of which involved
      the purchase and sale of shares of reporting issuers.  In each case, the
      reporting issuer had been engaged in a transaction on which DS was advising
      one of the parties.  In all ten trades, Mr.&nbsp;Duic purchased shares
      shortly before material information was publicly disclosed, and then sold
      the shares shortly after disclosure occurred.  In total, Mr.</span>&nbsp;<span lang=EN-US>Duic
      earned approximately $4.5 million from the ten trades.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After
      Mr.&nbsp;Duic completed one particularly high volume transaction, the OSC
      began an investigation.  It seized some of Mr.&nbsp;Duic’s offshore bank
      accounts.  Mr.&nbsp;Duic then entered into a settlement agreement with
      the OSC, under the terms of which he identified Mr.&nbsp;Rankin and other
      individuals as the sources of his tips and agreed to testify against them
      in any future proceedings.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE TRIAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    prosecution took a two-pronged approach at trial.  The first prong consisted
    of extensive documentary evidence demonstrating the pattern of Mr.&nbsp;Duic’s
    trades.  The second was Mr. Duic’s testimony.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found the documentary proof establishing that Mr. Duic had been
    tipped was “compelling and undeniable”.  However, it did not establish who
    had tipped Mr. Duic.  In that regard, the trial judge described the circumstantial
    case against Mr. Rankin as one that “lacks lift”.  He was not convinced that
    it was a reasonable inference that Mr. Rankin had tipped Mr. Duic, noting
    that many other people had access to the information in question.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence conceded that Mr.&nbsp;Duic had acted on the basis of tips but argued
    that Mr.&nbsp;Rankin was not the tipper.  Thus, the central issue at trial
    was whether it was Mr. Rankin who had tipped Mr. Duic.  Mr.&nbsp;Rankin testified
    that he had not provided tips; Mr.&nbsp;Duic testified that he had.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Credibility
    was a critical matter for the trial judge to decide.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that Mr.&nbsp;Rankin’s evidence was not believable and
    failed to raise a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.  In particular, he found
    suspicious Mr.&nbsp;Rankin’s acceptance of expensive trips and money from
    Mr. Duic and noted, with scepticism, Mr. Rankin’s refusal to concede that
    he knew much of anything in respect of the transactions in question.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    accepted Mr.&nbsp;Duic’s evidence despite the fact that Mr. Duic was the “only
    one to have benefited handsomely from the transgression”.  He found that
    Mr. Duic could not recall how he got the information for most of the deals
    because Mr. Duic’s focus, at the relevant times, had been on obtaining the
    information.  The trial judge stated that this problem with Mr. Duic’s testimony
    did not matter because he had concluded that Mr. Rankin had voluntarily passed
    on the material information.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    finding Mr.&nbsp;Rankin guilty of ten counts of tipping, the trial judge
    made global findings of fact; no specific findings were made regarding the
    circumstances of any individual tip.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge found that there was no evidence proving either that Mr.&nbsp;Rankin
    knew that Mr.&nbsp;Duic was engaged in insider trading on the basis of the
    tips he provided or that Mr.&nbsp;Rankin engaged in improper trading on his
    own.  Consequently, he acquitted Mr. Rankin on the insider trading charges.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE PROVINCIAL OFFENCES ACT
      APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appeal court judge overturned Mr.&nbsp;Rankin’s convictions on the grounds
      that the trial judge failed to: (1) properly assess Mr. Duic’s credibility
      and give sufficient reasons for his conclusion in that regard; and (2)
      either consider each tipping count separately or explain why evidence of
      each count was admissible as similar act evidence in relation to the other
      counts.  A brief elaboration of each of these grounds follows.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><i><span
lang=EN-US>Inadequate assessment of Mr. Duic’s credibility</span></i></b><b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appeal court judge noted that the trial judge must have accepted Mr. Duic’s
      evidence because he found that the rest of the trial evidence was not sufficient
      to sustain a conviction.  However, the appeal court judge found the trial
      judge’s assessment of Mr.&nbsp;Duic’s credibility to be wholly inadequate.  He
      also found that the trial judge gave an inadequate explanation for accepting
      Mr. Duic’s evidence.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge’s findings reveal the following.  Mr.&nbsp;Duic was a highly
      unreliable witness.  He was a cheat.  He would not necessarily tell the
      truth.  He admitted that he engaged in illegal activity (trading on inside
      information) from which he realized a substantial profit.  He made a favourable
      deal with the prosecution that permitted him to retain a significant portion
      of his illegitimate profits but which required him to identify a tipper.  He
      tailored the evidence that he gave to the OSC.  He provided conflicting
      evidence under oath on critical details regarding his dealings with Mr.
      Rankin – when he tried to recall how he got the information from Mr. Rankin,
      he “failed to get it right”.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      light of these factors, the appeal court judge held that the trial judge
      was obliged to approach Mr. Duic’s evidence with a high degree of caution
      or, at least, subject it to a rigorous examination.  He was obliged, as
      well, to seek out independent evidence to confirm Mr.&nbsp;Duic’s allegations.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appeal court judge viewed the trial judge as having done neither.  Paragraphs
      38, 42 and 44 of the reasons of the appeal court judge summarize his determinations
      in those regards.  </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[38]     Given all of these factors, there was
    every reason for the trial judge to approach Daniel Duic’s evidence with
    a high degree of caution and to seek out, from the rest of the evidence proferred,
    as much other independent evidence to confirm Mr. Duic’s allegations as could
    be found. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[42]     I appreciate that the statement by the
    trial judge that “I don’t necessarily take that position” does not amount
    to a clear-cut rejection of the need to look for evidence that might confirm
    aspects of Mr. Duic’s evidence.  There is no doubt that there is always a
    risk in dissecting any judge’s reasons too finely.  Nonetheless, the fact
    remains that, if the trial judge did accept that there was a need to find
    confirmatory evidence before reaching a favourable conclusion regarding Mr.
    Duic’s reliability, he does not subsequently identify any such evidence before
    reaching his ultimate conclusion that Mr. Duic’s evidence provided the necessary
    basis upon which findings of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt could be made.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[44]     Of all of these problems regarding Mr.
    Duic’s veracity as a witness, the trial judge only explained why one of them
    did not trouble him and that is the last one, the fact that Mr. Duic could
    not correctly recall the details of how he got the information from Mr. Rankin.  The
    trial judge excused Mr. Duic’s failings in this respect by saying that Mr.
    Duic’s focus was on getting the information and that the when and where of
    how that happened did not matter.  The trial judge then went on to say “Nor
    does it matter for our purposes”.  With respect, I do not see how the trial
    judge could have properly reached that conclusion.  The reliability of Mr.
    Duic’s evidence as to when and where he received the information from Mr.
    Rankin was an essential way of determining the overall reliability of his
    allegations.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>Failure to consider each
        tipping count </span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appeal court judge noted the trial judge’s failure to consider each of
      the ten counts of tipping independently to determine whether Mr.&nbsp;Rankin’s
      guilt had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  He held that as the trial
      judge made no express finding that the evidence of each count was admissible
      as similar act evidence in relation to each other count, the trial judge
      was obligated to consider each count independently.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>From
      the reasons of the appeal court judge, it appears that in making this determination,
      he was responding, at least in part, to a submission of the OSC.  He wrote
      this, at para. 65 of the reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[65]     The OSC fairly concedes
      that the trial judge’s global approach to the ten counts would appear,
      on the surface, to be improper.  That concession was subject to an important
      exception, however.  The OSC submitted that the trial judge was justified
      in dealing with the ten counts as a whole if he was satisfied that the
      evidence on each of the counts could be used as evidence on all of the
      other counts on the basis of similar act evidence.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>At
      para. 73 of the reasons, the appeal court judge summarized his conclusion
      on this matter as follows:    </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[73]     Absent that careful analysis, and a clear
    and definitive conclusion that similar act evidence was admissible, the trial
    judge was obliged to consider each count individually.  Contrary to the OSC’s
    submission, I do not agree that “the verdicts withstand scrutiny on each
    individual count”.  Given the numerous inconsistencies in Mr. Duic’s evidence,
    and the other possible ways in which Mr. Duic could have obtained inside
    information at different times regarding different transactions, the proper
    verdict on each count is far from certain.  The trial judge’s failure to
    undertake a count by count analysis is an error of law. </p>

    offences appeal judgments are intended to be final.  The jurisprudence of
    this court is clear: leave should be granted under s.&nbsp;131 only in exceptional
    cases raising issues of broad public importance.  Justice&nbsp;Carthy explained
    in <i>R. v. Zakarow</i> (1990), 74 O.R. (2d) 621 at 625-6:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>…
    [S. 131] of the <i>Provincial Offences Act</i> sets a very high threshold
    for granting leave to appeal.  There must be special grounds on a question
    of law and it must be essential in the public interest or for the due administration
    of justice that leave be granted.  No matter how wrong the judgment under
    appeal may be, these other criteria must be met.  The section was clearly

      leave to appeal is granted, the OSC will advance three grounds of appeal.  These
      grounds are that the appeal court judge erred in: (1) substituting his
      view of the credibility of Mr. Duic for that of the trial judge; (2) misapplying
      the law regarding similar fact evidence; and, (3) misapplying the standard
      of review regarding a trial judge’s reasons.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      OSC argues that the appeal it seeks leave to pursue is of extraordinary
      importance in securities regulation.  It notes that the tipping provisions
      in the <i>Securities Act </i>are essential tools for maintaining the integrity
      of the capital markets and fostering investor confidence.  As this case
      is the first tipping prosecution, it is of considerable interest and importance
      to both the investment industry and the public generally.  Thus, the OSC
      argues, it is essential in the public interest and for the due administration
      of justice, that the grounds on which the appeal court judge reversed the
      trial judge be clarified so that future insider tipping prosecutions are
      conducted properly.  </span></p>

'><span lang=EN-US>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section
      131(2) provides that leave is not to be granted unless, in the particular
      circumstances of the case, it is “essential in the public interest or for
      the due administration of justice”.  In my view, that wording does not
      preclude granting leave in a case of considerable public importance even
      if the question of law raised is not new, novel or otherwise unsettled,
      so long as the resolution of the question is essential.  Nonetheless, I
      would refuse to grant leave in this case.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      begin with this observation.  When considering whether a proposed appeal
      raises an issue of broad public importance, the focus is not on the subject
      matter of the appeal but on the questions of law to be resolved on appeal.  Thus,
      the fact that insider tipping and the proper prosecution of tipping offences
      are important matters of public significance is not sufficient to warrant
      granting leave.  Leave under s. 131 is to be granted only if the appeal
      raises questions of law on which this court’s guidance is essential in
      the public interest or for the due administration of justice.  None of
      the proposed grounds of appeal raise such questions.  </span></p>

'><span lang=EN-US>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Simply
      stated, the appeal court judge overturned the convictions on the basis
      of errors made by the trial judge in the application of well-established
      legal principles, none of which are specific to tipping.  Consequently,
      the questions raised on the proposed appeal do not meet the very high threshold
      for leave in s. 131.       </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There
      is no statutory interpretation issue raised on the proposed appeal.  U</span><span
lang=EN-US>nlike <i>Ontario (Ministry of Labour) v. Hamilton (City of), </i>[2002]
      O.J. No. 283 (Ont. C.A.), where there were conflicting lower court judgments
      as to the proper application of the regulations under the <i>Occupational
      Health and Safety Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.1, there is no conflicting
      jurisprudence in relation to insider tipping.  This case is also unlike <i>Memorial
      Gardens Ltd. v. Ontario </i>(1991), 2 O.R. (3d) 417 (C.A.), in which leave
      to appeal was granted because the trial judgment created uncertainty in
      relation to the meaning of certain provisions in the <i>Business Practices
      Act</i>, R.S.O. 1980, c. 55.  The Judgment does not engender uncertainty
      in respect of the <i>Securities Act</i>.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      first and third proposed grounds of appeal frequently arise in appeals;
      they are based on settled law.  In addition, t</span><span
lang=EN-US>he reasonableness of the trial judge’s credibility findings, and the
      sufficiency of his reasons in that regard, are matters relevant only to
      the parties to this case.  Thus, there is nothing in those grounds that
      raises a question on which this court’s guidance is required.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      relation to the second ground, the appeal court judge identified, on the
      basis of settled legal principles, the key error of law made by the trial
      judge:  his failure to consider the evidence on each count independently.  The
      trial judge could not simply accept Mr. Duic’s evidence and then conclude
      that each of the ten tipping counts had been made out.  Guilt or innocence
      had to be decided on a count-by-count basis.  The evidence on each count
      was different and the trial judge had to consider the evidence that was
      admissible on each count to determine whether he was satisfied, beyond
      a reasonable doubt, that the elements of the offence had been made out
      in relation to that count.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      accept that it was open to the trial judge to find that the global evidence
      about the ongoing relationship between Mssrs. Duic and Rankin became part
      of the evidentiary backdrop against which each count was to be considered.  In
      that regard, the appeal court judge may have taken an unduly narrow approach
      to the admissibility and use that could be made of the evidence relating
      to that relationship.    However, even if the appeal court judge was in
      error in saying that a strict similar act evidence analysis was required,
      the appropriate handling of that evidence raises no new question of law.  Further,
      in light of the appeal court judge’s conclusion in respect of Mr. Duic’s
      credibility, a new trial is required in any event.  </span></p>

      see nothing in the appeal court decision that would have a negative effect
      on the OSC’s ability to prosecute tipping, either against Mr.&nbsp;Rankin
      or more generally.  Although the OSC may have suffered negative publicity
      as a result of the first tipping convictions being overturned, I do not
      see the Judgment as creating new or additional legal impediments to such
      prosecutions.  </span></p>
