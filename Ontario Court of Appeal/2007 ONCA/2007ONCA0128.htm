  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is an appeal from an order for the forfeiture of firearms made under s.&nbsp;117.05(4)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    September 14, 2004, two police officers attended at the appellant’s residence
    in response to her complaint concerning noise from her neighbours.  Based
    on their dis-cussions with and observations of the appellant, the officers
    concluded that she was suicidal.  Accordingly, they took the appellant to
    the hospital for the determination by a physician as to whether she should
    be detained under s. 15 of the <i>Mental Health Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.
    M.7 (the “MHA”) for a psychiatric assessment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Within
    ten minutes of their arrival at the hospital, one of the police officers,
    Acting/Sergeant Allore, obtained a firearms licence that was in the appellant’s
    possession, together with the keys to her house and her firearms’ cabinet.  There
    is no suggestion that these items were obtained unlawfully.  Officer Allore
    then left the hospital to return to the appellant’s home to search for her
    firearms.  The remaining police officer, Constable Hawley, was informed at
    about the same time that the attending physician intended to sign an involuntary
    admission form under the MHA (a “Form 1”) regarding the appellant, requiring
    her detention for the purpose of a psychiatric exam-ination.  Officer Allore
    was not told of this decision before he left the hospital.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying
    on s. 117.04(2) of the Code, Officer Allore attended and entered the appellant’s
    residence without a warrant to search for her firearms.  He seized seven
    firearms in total, all of which were registered to the appellant and properly
    stored by her at the time of the seizure.  Officer Allore then returned to
    the hospital where he learned of the Form 1 authorization for the appellant’s
    detention.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly
    thereafter, Officer Hawley and another police officer transported the appellant
    to a psychiatric facility for an evaluation.  They arrived there about three
    hours after the search of the appellant’s home.  The appellant was released
    from that facility less than forty-eight hours later.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    October 12, 2004, Officer Allore applied under s. 117.05(1) of the Code for
    a hearing concerning the forfeiture of the seized firearms.  At the hearing,
    the appellant argued that the requirements of s. 117.04(2) of the Code had
    not been met, with the result that the warrantless search could not be justified
    and no seizure of her firearms had occurred under s. 117.04(2).  She claimed,
    therefore, that the application judge lacked jurisdiction to conduct the
    forfeiture hearing under s. 117.05(1) of the Code.  She also submitted that
    the search was unreasonable in the circumstances and that it violated s.
    8 of the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>. The appellant’s arguments
    regarding s.&nbsp;117.04(2) and her <i>Charter</i> challenge were heard together.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge, L.E. Chester J. of the Ontario Court of Justice, disagreed.  He
    held that the preconditions to invocation of s. 117.04(2) of the Code had
    been satisfied and that no breach of s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i> had occurred.  Further,
    because a lawful search had been carried out under s. 117.04(2), he concluded
    that he had jurisdiction to proceed with a forfeiture hearing under s. 117.05(1)
    of the Code.  Accordingly, on January 4, 2006, he granted the forfeiture
    application.  He allowed the appellant thirty days from the date of his order
    to transfer the ownership of the firearms to a lawful recipient, failing
    which the firearms would be forfeited to the Crown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appealed.  On August 28, 2006, A.J. Stong J. of the Superior Court
    of Justice held that the search infringed the appellant’s rights under s.
    8 of the <i>Charter</i>.  However, he also held that the evidence of the
    firearms was admissible under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i> and that the
    application judge had jurisdiction to conduct the forfeiture hearing.  He
    dismissed the appellant’s appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant now appeals to this court.  She argues that the appeal judge erred:
    (i) by failing to hold that the application judge lacked jurisdiction to
    entertain the forfeiture application; and (ii) by finding that the test for
    a forfeiture order under s. 117.05(1) of the Code was met.  For the reasons
    that follow, it is my view that the appeal must be dis-missed.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>2.         Relevant Statutory
      Provisions</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sections
    117.04(1) and (2) and ss. 117.05(1) and (4) of the Code state:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   117.04 (1) Where, pursuant to an application
    made by a peace officer with respect to any person, a justice is satisfied
    by information on oath that there are reasonable grounds to believe that
    the person possesses a weapon…and that it is not desirable in the interests
    of the safety of the person, or of any other person, for the person to possess
    the weapon…the justice may issue a warrant authorizing a peace officer to
    search…and seize any such thing, and any authorization, licence or registration
    certificate relating to any such thing, that is held by or in the possession
    of the person.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>                 (2) Where, with respect to any
    person, a peace officer is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to
    believe that it is not desirable, in the interests of the safety of the person
    or any other person, for the person to possess any weapon…the peace officer
    may, where the grounds for obtaining a warrant under subsection (1) exist
    but, by reason of a possible danger to the safety of that person or any other
    person, it would not be practicable to obtain a warrant, search for and seize
    any such thing, and any authorization, licence or registration certificate
    relating to any such thing, that is held by or in the possession of the person.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center;'>….</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   117.05 (1) Where any thing or document has been
    seized under subsection 117.04(1) or (2), the justice who issued the warrant
    authorizing the seizure or, if no warrant was issued, a justice who might
    otherwise have issued a warrant, shall, on application for an order for the
    disposition of the thing or document so seized made by a peace officer within
    thirty days after the date of execution of the warrant or of the seizure
    without a warrant, as the case may be, fix a date for the hearing of the
    application and direct that notice of the hearing be given to such persons
    or in such manner as the justice may specify.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center;'>….</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>                (4) Where, following the hearing
    of an application made under subsection (1), the justice finds that it is
    not desirable in the interests of the safety of the person from whom the
    thing was seized or of any other person that the person should possess any
    weapon…the justice shall</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>         (a) order that any thing seized be forfeited
    to Her Majesty or be otherwise disposed of; and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>         (b) where the justice is satisfied that
    the circumstances warrant such an action, order that the possession by that
    person of any weapon…be prohibited during any period, not exceeding five
    years, that is spec-ified in the order, beginning on the making of the order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    8 of the <i>Charter</i> provides, “Everyone has the right to be secure against
    unreasonable search or seizure.”</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>3.         Discussion</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>            (1)       Jurisdictional
      Challenge</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    appellant submits that on a plain reading of s. 117.05(1), a forfeiture hearing
    under that section may only be conducted where the firearms in question were
    validly seized with a warrant under s. 117.04(1) or without a warrant under
    s. 117.04(2).  The appellant contends that neither section was engaged in
    this case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is uncontested that no warrant was obtained here.  Thus, s. 117.04(1) is
    inapplicable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    three reasons, the appellant maintains that s. 117.04(2) is similarly inapplicable
    and, therefore, that the application judge had no jurisdiction under s.&nbsp;117.05(1)
    to conduct the forfeiture hearing.  First, she submits that the preconditions
    for a warrantless search under s. 117.04(2) were not met in this case.  Consequently,
    her firearms were not validly seized under the authority of that section.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellant argues that the appeal judge correctly concluded that the search
    violated s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellant contends that “the [MHA] cannot be used in conjunction with
    s. 117.04(2) of the [Code]”, that is, recourse by the police to s. 117.04(2)
    of the Code is precluded where a person is detained under the MHA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would reject these submissions for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Warrantless
    searches are presumptively unlawful.  However, s. 117.04(2) of the Code authorizes
    the search and seizure of weapons, without the necessity of a warrant, where:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)   a peace officer is satisfied that there are
    reasonable grounds to believe that it is not desirable in the interests of
    the safety of the person in the possession of any weapon, or any other person,
    to continue to possess that weapon; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)  the grounds for obtaining a warrant set out
    in s. 117.04(1) of the Code exist; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii) it is impracticable to obtain a warrant because
    of a pos-sible danger to the safety of the person in the possession of the
    weapon, or any other person.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are concerned here only with the third precondition, namely, whether it was
    impracticable in the circumstances for the police to obtain a warrant before
    searching for the appellant’s firearms because of a possible danger to the
    safety of the appellant or any other person arising from the appellant’s
    possession of the firearms.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that once she was detained under the MHA, any “possible
    danger” to herself or others was negated because one of two events would
    then occur.  First, she could be admitted to a psychiatric facility under
    the authority of a Form 1, thus removing the possibility of any immediate
    danger to herself or any other person arising from her possession of the
    firearms.  Alternatively, she could be released following her examination
    by a physician, thereby establishing that she was not a danger to herself
    or others.  In either event, two requirements for a warrantless search under
    s. 117.04(2) – a possible danger arising from the appellant’s possession
    of the firearms and the imprac-ticability of obtaining a warrant – would
    not be met.  In this case, the first scenario applied, that is, the examining
    physician signed a Form 1 for the appellant’s detention.  The appellant therefore
    argues that the police officers had sufficient time to obtain a warrant,
    no immediate possible danger arose from her possession of the firearms, and
    s. 117.04(2) of the Code could not be invoked to justify a warrantless search.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree.  The appellant does not dispute that she was suicidal when the
    police took her to the hospital for an examination.  The application judge
    accepted Office Allore’s testimony that when they arrived at the hospital,
    Officer Allore was concerned that the appellant would “shore herself up” and
    deny that she was suicidal, causing the hospital to release her.  The application
    judge found that Officer Allore had “a specific concern” for the appellant’s
    safety because she was a high suicide risk and, further, that he had “a concern
    for the general public” because the appellant had firearms at her residence
    and it was uncertain whether she would be detained for a psychiatric assess-ment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge reviewed the information concerning the appellant that
    was available to Officer Allore before the search, including the fact that
    there were clear indications that the appellant wanted to end her life and
    that she was making “concrete plans to do so”.  He then held:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>There was a possible danger to her own safety
    or the safety of others, her neighbours and also her family.  It is not necessary
    that he believe actual danger, just a possible danger.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>[Officer Allore] acted on the possibility that
    she might be released from hospital and that she could return directly to
    her residence.  He did not consider, under the circumstances, a warrant to
    be practical.  Under these circumstances, his beliefs that she was a danger
    to herself and, so, to the public was an honest and reasonable one.  Reasonable,
    not only when viewed subjectively but when also viewed objectively.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, the application judge concluded that the preconditions for a
    lawful search under s. 117.04(2) of the Code had been satisfied and that
    no infringement of the appellant’s s. 8 <i>Charter</i> rights had occurred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal judge reviewed the application judge’s conclusion that the police
    had acted in conformity with the terms of s. 117.04(2) of the Code but did
    not expressly indicate whether he accepted that finding.  However, contrary
    to the application judge’s finding, the appeal judge held that a breach of
    the appellant’s s. 8 <i>Charter</i> rights had been established.  He reasoned
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Within 10 minutes of her arrival at the hospital
    the appellant was detained under the [MHA] for at least 72 hours of observation
    by the attending physician.  The possibility of the appellant being a danger
    to herself or anyone else thereby abated.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=center style='text-align:center'>….</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>I am satisfied that there was a breach of the
    appellant’s <i>Charter</i> rights.  Even before a warrant could be obtained,
    [Constable] Hawley came into possession of the pertinent infor-mation that
    the appellant had been committed for observation under the [MHA] thereby
    negating the possibility of creating danger to herself or any other members
    of the public.  Although he did not forward that information to [Officer]
    Allore, it is information attributable to [Officer Allore] in as much as
    the Crown is one and indivisible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, this reasoning is flawed in two respects.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    a Form 1 authorization for the detention of a person under the MHA is not
    a detention “for at least 72 hours of observation”
    by a physician.  Section 15(5) of the MHA authorizes the detention of a person
    in a psychiatric facility under a Form 1 signed by a physician for a period “not
    more than 72 hours”.  Thus, the appellant’s detention was not for a period
    of “at least” seventy-two hours.  To the contrary, the length of her detention
    was uncertain.  She could have been released within minutes or hours of her
    initial detention at the hospital.  This possibility ultimately materialized
    when the appellant was released from the hospital in less than forty-eight
    hours.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the detention of the appellant pursuant to the MHA did not have the effect
    of “abating” or “negating” the possibility of the appellant being a danger
    to herself or others for a period of seventy-two hours.  As I have said,
    the appellant could have been released from the hospital at any time after
    her initial detention under a Form 1.  In this important sense, therefore,
    a possible danger to the appellant’s safety and to the public persisted when
    Officer Allore conducted the search.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    nothing on this record suggests that there was any realistic opportunity
    for the police to obtain a warrant in the time that elapsed between the appellant’s
    arrival at the hospital and the completion of the search carried out by Officer
    Allore.  The Officer testified that the time required to obtain a search
    warrant for a residence could vary from “as little as four or five hours
    to two days or more sometimes of trying to confirm your grounds…and articulate
    it”.  He also said that he did not know for sure whether the appellant was
    going to be assessed until he got back to the hospital after seizing her
    firearms and that, if she were released, it would be too late to seize them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, when public safety issues are implicated, as in this case, the police
    should not be required to speculate upon the timing of the release from hospital
    of a person in the appellant’s position in the hope that they might secure
    a warrant for the seizure of firearms in the possession of the detainee before
    that release.  Matters of public safety, when firearms are involved, should
    not depend on guesswork; nor are they a ‘race to the swiftest’.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant correctly points out that the Crown did not appeal the appeal judge’s
    finding of a s. 8 <i>Charter</i> breach.  However, given the ultimate dismissal
    of the appellant’s appeal by the appeal judge, it was not open to the Crown
    to do so.  I note that in its factum filed with this court, the Crown challenged
    the appeal judge’s conclusion concerning the appellant’s <i>Charter</i> challenge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    and more importantly, the appeal judge’s holding that the appellant’s s.&nbsp;8 <i>Charter</i> rights
    had been violated rested on a flawed appreciation of the applicable provisions
    of the MHA and the consequences thereof for the appellant’s own safety and
    that of others.  As a result, it is open to this court to assess the validity
    of that key holding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence before the application judge clearly demonstrated that, at the time
    of the search, the appellant’s continued possession of the firearms posed
    a possible danger to herself and to others.  The imminence of this existing
    possible danger was not diminished by the fact of her initial detention for
    medical examination under the authority of s. 15 of the MHA.  Because the
    length of the appellant’s detention under the MHA was uncertain, I am not
    persuaded that it was practicable, having regard to public safety and the
    safety of the appellant, for Officer Allore to first seek a warrant before
    conducting a search of the appellant’s residence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    do I accept the appellant’s claim that detention under a Form 1 signed pursuant
    to the MHA precludes or suspends the authority of the police to conduct a
    search for firearms under s. 117.04(2) of the Code in a proper case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    test for the detention of a person under s. 15(1) of the MHA is predicated,
    in part, on a physician forming the opinion that the person in question is
    apparently suffering from a mental disorder of a nature or quality that “likely
    will result” in “serious bodily harm” to that person or another person or “serious
    physical impairment” of the potential detainee.  This is a stringent standard
    that depends on the informed opinion of a physician as to the likelihood
    of harm or impairment following the examination of the person in question.  In
    contrast, resort to s. 117.04(2) of the Code requires only a “possible danger” to
    the safety of the person in the possession of a weapon or to the safety of
    any other person, rendering the obtaining of a search warrant impracticable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    the regime contemplated by the MHA employs a standard for detention and envisages
    a factual underpinning for detention than is significantly different than
    the standard for a warrantless search and seizure provided for under s.&nbsp;117.04(2)
    of the Code.  Given these different standards, the legal criteria for a Form
    1 detention under the MHA may not be met in a given case, although the possibility
    of danger to the prospective detainee or to the public may exist, thereby
    justifying a warrantless search for and seizure of weapons in the possession
    of the prospective detainee.  The appeal judge put it this way:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The jurisdiction of a police officer to conduct
    a warrantless search, even where it is carried out while the subject person
    is detained under the [MHA], is dictated by the facts giving rise to the
    evoking of the provisions of the Criminal Code.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Although the [MHA] allows a physician to involuntarily
    admit a person for observation, it remains that there is no guarantee that
    this will happen in every case.  Inasmuch as [s.] 117.04(2) relates to
    ‘possible’ circumstances and not ‘probable’ circumstances, an arrest pursuant
    to the [MHA] does not in and of itself preclude the police from acting under
    [s.] 117.04(2) where the person is undergoing the initial assessment and
    is subsequently detained for further obser-vation any more than it precludes
    the police from acting under [s.] 117.04(2) where the person is undergoing
    the initial assessment and is subsequently released from the hospital.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I agree with the application judge that, in all the circumstances, the preconditions
    to the invocation of s. 117.04(2) of the Code were satisfied.  Thus, the
    search here was authorized under that statutory provision.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    also agree with the application judge’s conclusion that there was no breach
    of s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i> in this case.  The appellant’s s. 8 <i>Charter</i> challenge
    was predicated on the premise that s. 117.04(2) of the Code did not apply
    to justify the search in question.  Section 8 of the <i>Charter</i> protects
    against unreasonable search and seizure.  A search will be reasonable only
    if it is authorized by law, the law itself is reasonable, and the search
    is conducted in a reasonable manner: see <i>R. v. Collins</i> (1987), 33
    C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).  I have already concluded that the impugned search
    was authorized under s. 117.04(2) of the Code.  The appellant does not attack
    the constitutionality of s. 117.04(2).  Nor is there any suggestion that
    the search was carried out in an unreasonable manner.  Thus, there is no
    basis on which to conclude that the search of the appellant’s residence and
    the seizure of her firearms was unreasonable in the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    follows that the firearms in question were validly seized under s. 117.04(2)
    of the Code.  This was sufficient to establish the application judge’s jurisdiction
    to conduct a forfeiture hearing under s. 117.05(1) of the Code.  See for
    example, <i>R. v. Merchant </i>(1991), 64 C.C.C. (3d) 316 (Alta.

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    the wrong test for a forfeiture order under s. 117.05(4) of the Code.  Again,
    I disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge expressly recognized that s. 117.05(4) requires the deter-mination
    of the sufficiency of the evidence relied upon to support a forfeiture order
    as at the date of the forfeiture hearing, rather than the date of the commencement
    of the forfeiture application: see <i>R. v. Laframboise</i>, [2002] O.J.
    No. 5291 (Ct. J.).  He was also alive to the requirement established by s.
    117.05(3) of the Code, that he consider all the relevant evidence at the
    forfeiture hearing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge considered all the relevant evidence at the forfeiture
    hearing, which consisted of the evidence of Officers Allore and Hawley, and
    documentary medical evidence, dating from after the seizure of the appellant’s
    firearms, tendered on behalf of the appellant.  This evidence indicated that
    the appellant suffers from delusions and paranoia, that she believes that
    she is the subject of a police conspiracy, that she exhibits anger, and that
    she presents with poor insight and only “fair” judgment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence before the application judge thus amply supported his conclusion
    that, as at the date of the forfeiture hearing, the conditions exhibited
    by the appellant when she was detained on September 14, 2004 continued to
    exist, such that it was not desirable in the interests of the appellant’s
    own safety or the safety of others that she continue to possess firearms.  I
    see no error in the appeal judge’s decision to refrain from interfering with
    this conclusion by the application judge.</p>
