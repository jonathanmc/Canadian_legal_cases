    the clerk testified that the robber had green eyes (the appellant has blue
    eyes).&nbsp; He insisted that the robber had a small moustache (there was

    Hughes was a crack cocaine addict.&nbsp; She testified that she remembered
    an occasion in 2004 in the early evening after 6:00 p.m. when she went by
    car to buy crack cocaine with Diana Evely, the accused and another man.  The
    time did not match the time of the robbery, which was around midnight.  They
    all drove to the back of a Ramada Hotel at Jane and Wilson.  Hughes testified
    that the men exited from the car and when they returned later, the appellant
    had money and phone cards.  She then said that she did not see the appellant
    in possession of any phone cards that night.  They all went to buy drugs
    and smoked.  Later that night, the police stopped their car and the accused
    was arrested for being out after curfew.  A week later, Hughes gave phone
    cards to her boyfriend.  She stated that she had no idea where the cards
    came from.  She did not recall seeing the appellant in possession of phone
    cards at any time.</p>

    Hughes had been a crack cocaine user for four or five years and was still
    a user at the time of her testimony.  She agreed that her memory of the events
    may have been affected by her use of crack cocaine and that, at times, she
    hallucinated when under the influence of crack cocaine.  She had been a crack
    dealer and had a disagreement with the appellant.</p>

    December 1, 2004, she gave a statement to the police.  At trial, she agreed
    that what she told the police may not have been accurate.  Her memory of
    the day was spotty because she was high on cocaine.&nbsp; She acknowledged
    that she had no recollection of being at Jane and
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    Wilson in the winter of 2004 until the police told her that they were interested
    in that time period and location.  She could not independently tell counsel
    the day or year of the incident about which she was testifying.  The police
    had suggested the date to her.  Having reviewed her statement to the police,
    she said that the incident had happened on March 12, 2003. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    Hughes testified that she did not know anything specific about the 7-11 store
    robbery.&nbsp; The appellant never told her what he did after he left the
    car.&nbsp; She admitted she had no idea whether the night she described was
    the same night as the robbery.</p>

    police suggested the date to her.&nbsp; She did not know where the men went
    when they left the car and she never saw the appellant with phone cards.&nbsp;

    second witness, Diana Evely, was also a crack cocaine user.&nbsp; She testified
    that she had been driving with Hughes, the appellant and another man.&nbsp;
    They had parked at the back of the Ramada Hotel and the two men had gone
    out of the car.&nbsp; They came back running and she did not see the men
    carrying anything. &nbsp;She remembered having been stopped by the police
    when she was with Hughes, the appellant and another man.&nbsp; The appellant
    was not supposed to be out at night and had been arrested.&nbsp; She was
    unsure of whether it was March 2004 or 2005. &nbsp;She guessed that she was
    high that day, although she did not know.</p>

    Evely alternatively claimed that she never discussed the case with Hughes
    and that Hughes could have “jogged” her memory.  She later admitted that
    she did not remember going to the hotel until Linda told her about it.  When
    she first spoke to the police, it was possible that she did not remember
    going to the Ramada Hotel that day, that the police had jogged her memory
    about the two men in the car and later that the police had suggested to her
    that the appellant was in the car.  The police told her that she had been
    pulled over in March.&nbsp; She was confused as to the identity of the two
    men in the car.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    in the case of the first witness, her evidence was, essentially, unreliable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    video of the robbery was led into evidence.  The trial judge not only made
    no finding that it was of assistance to her, she never referred to it in
    her reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    police never located any of the phone cards stolen at the store.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, the verdict convicting the appellant in this court was unreasonable.
    The trial judge improperly downplayed distinctive characteristics of the
    robber in the identification of the store clerk that tended to exclude the
    appellant, namely, that the robber had green eyes (the appellant has blue
    eyes) and that he had a moustache (appellant had no moustache).  The trial
    judge failed to deal with the frailties and danger posed by the evidence
    of Hughes and Evely.  She did not deal with the serious inconsistencies in
    the evidence with respect to the phone cards, the relationship between Hughes
    and the appellant and Hughes false occupation against the appellant in another
    robbery.  She referred to unspecified corroboration of the evidence of Hughes
    and Evely that is not apparent.  Moreover, even if accepted, the evidence
    of Hughes and Evely went no farther than putting the appellant on the scene
    of the robbery. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, the evidence relating to the 7-11 store robbery was so unreliable
    that it could not support the conviction.&nbsp; At its highest, it amounted
    to nothing more than suspicion and the verdict is not one that a properly
    instructed jury acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered.&nbsp; The
    convictions on counts 4 and 5 are quashed.</p>

    five feet, six inches (there was no evidence at trial of the appellant’s
    height), 135 pounds and about 25 years old.  He was wearing a black toque,
    a black t-shirt and black pants.&nbsp; He grabbed the cash register and left

    pregnant girlfriend in the early morning of April 27, 2004.&nbsp; He admitted
    having been somewhat confused about the date.&nbsp; The detectives had suggested
    the cash register incident to him and that the date was in April.&nbsp; Mr.
    Gohn said that the appellant asked him to pull over, got out of the car and
    came back a few minutes later carrying a cash register.&nbsp; They drove
    away and later, the appellant got out of the car, threw the cash register
    on the ground, got it open and took out about $200-$300 and they went to
    buy drugs. </p>

    with the appellant who had “hit” on his then girlfriend.&nbsp; </p>

    days later, on April 29, the appellant was arrested in a car.&nbsp; Clothing
    was found in the car that did not clearly match the robber’s clothing in

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    reasons of the trial judge are sketchy.&nbsp; However, she recognized that
    Mr. Gohn was an unsavoury witness and she stated that she directed her mind
    to “<i>Vetrovec</i> considerations”.  Without a jury, she is presumed to
    know the law.&nbsp;&nbsp; She rejected any animus between the appellant and
    Mr. Gohn.&nbsp;&nbsp; As there was the evidence that they smoked crack cocaine
    together, this conclusion is not unreasonable.&nbsp; She also found some
    support for the evidence of Mr. Gohn in the video from the surveillance camera.&nbsp; </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If
    believed by the trier of fact, the evidence of the robber walking away with
    the cash register and the evidence of Mr. Gohn that the appellant came back
    to the car carrying it in his arms, two rather unusual occurrences, and the
    evidence that the appellant later took the money out of the cash register,
    clearly supported conviction.  We are not persuaded that the verdict is one
    that a properly instructed jury acting judicially, could not have rendered.</p>
