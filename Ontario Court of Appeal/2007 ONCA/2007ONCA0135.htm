    appeal concerns the recommendation of the respondent, RSM Richter Inc., (“Richter”)
    the court-appointed receiver of The Ravelston Corporation Limited (“Ravelston”),
    that, pursuant to a plea agreement it negotiated with the United States Attorney’s
    Office,  Ravelston enter a plea of guilty on a charge of mail fraud in a
    United States District Court.  The motion judge gave detailed and well-considered
    reasons finding, at para. 154, that the receiver’s recommendation to enter
    the plea agreement was “well within the bounds of reasonableness” and granted
    the receiver’s approval motion.  The appellants, Conrad Black and his holding
    company that formerly controlled Ravelston, Conrad Black Capital Corporation,
    and Peter G. White Management Ltd. And Peter White, a former director of Ravelston, seek to appeal the order
    permitting Ravelston to plead guilty.</p>

    respondents move to quash this appeal on the ground that leave is required
    pursuant to the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act,</i> R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3,
    s. 193(e), or the <i>Companies Creditors Arrangement Act</i>,<i> </i>R.S.C.
    1985, c. C-36,  s. 13.  The appellants brought a cross motion for leave to
    appeal if necessary.  In the circumstances, without deciding the motion to
    quash, we heard argument on the question of leave and the merits and these
    reasons should not be read as deciding the question of whether the appellants
    are entitled to an appeal as of right.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge applied the appropriate standard when considering Richter’s
    recommendation:  see <i>Re Ravelston Corp</i>. (2005) 24 C.B.R. (5<sup>th</sup>)
    256 at para. 40 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    ):  “If the receiver’s decision is within the broad bounds of reasonableness,
    and if it proceeds fairly, having considered the interests of all stakeholders,
    the court will support the receiver’s decision.”  It is well established
    that an appellate court owes substantial deference to the discretion of a
    commercial court judge charged with the responsibility of supervising insolvency
    and restructuring proceedings and that absent demonstrable error, it will
    not interfere.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>MERITS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the motion judge clearly erred by considering the
    risk of conviction and by failing to consider the possibility of the “acquittal
    contingency” in which all individual defendants are exonerated.  The appellants
    further submit that the terms of the plea agreement fail to provide Ravelston
    with sufficient benefit to justify surrendering the possibility of an acquittal
    on all counts.  For the following reasons we reject these submissions.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>(a)       <u>Risk of conviction and
    possibility of acquittal</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    submission that the receiver and the motion judge erred by basing their decision
    on an assessment of the risk of conviction is entirely without merit.  As
    a matter of logic, professional responsibility and judgment, the risk of
    conviction was the first factor to consider.  Nor do we agree with the suggestion
    that the receiver failed to take adequate steps to obtain the necessary information
    to assess the risk of conviction.  The receiver was entitled to enter plea
    negotiations with the prosecutor and this almost inevitably interfered with
    the commonality of interest Ravelston had shared with the other defendants.  As
    for the “acquittal contingency”, the appellants put forth nothing but conjecture
    and their faith in their ability to destroy Radler’s credibility on cross-examination
    to challenge the receiver’s assessment that Ravelston faces a substantial
    risk of conviction.  Without knowing the theory of the defence of the individual
    defendants, we cannot accept the submission that acquittal of the individual
    defendants would make Ravelston’s acquittal “inevitable” in the face of the
    guilty plea and the evidence of Radler, its President and Chief Operating
    Officer. </p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>(b)       <u>Benefit of the plea agreement</u></h3>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'><span
style='font-weight:normal'>(i)        <u>Cost of defence</u></span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    of the principal benefits of the plea agreement is that Ravelston would avoid
    the costs of a defence in the criminal proceedings.  We see no merit in the
    submission that the motion judge erred by rejecting the appellants’ submission
    that the cost of a defence in the criminal proceedings could have been avoided
    without pleading guilty by adopting a “coat-tail” defence with the other
    defendants.  This suggestion essentially ignores the separate identity and
    interests of Ravelston that both the receiver and the motion judge were required
    to consider.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>(ii)       <u>Fine
    and restitution order</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was clearly open to the motion judge to conclude that the plea agreement
    benefited Ravelston by essentially capping the fine and reducing its risk
    of exposure to a large restitution order, particularly in relation to the
    $26 million&nbsp;in potential liability arising out of&nbsp;the Can-West
    transaction.  By pleading guilty to one count only and agreeing to the fine
    to be imposed, Ravelston substantially reduced its monetary exposure.  With
    respect to the restitution order, while Ravelston remains legally exposed
    to a significant order, a guilty plea would potentially assist Ravelston
    when the sentencing judge exercises his or her discretion in fixing the quantum
    of the restitution order. The terms of the plea agreement explicitly preserve
    Ravelston’s rights to argue that any fine and restitution order are not enforceable
    in
    <st1:place

    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-weight:normal'>(iii)     <u>Impact on civil proceedings</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    there may be some ambiguity in the terms of the plea agreement as to what
    facts Ravelston admits, we cannot say that the receiver’s assessment that
    it significantly reduced Ravelston’s risk of exposure to civil liability
    exceeded the bounds of reasonableness.  This argument must be considered
    in the light of the receiver’s assessment that Ravelston faced a substantial
    risk of conviction on all counts.  In that scenario, Ravelston’s position
    in the outstanding civil proceedings would be severely prejudiced.  Even
    on the least favourable interpretation of the plea agreement, the guilty
    plea could not provide the basis for issue estoppel with respect to the Can-West
    transaction.  Moreover, the appellants provided no evidence as to foreign
    law to support their contention that, for the purposes of issue estoppel,
    the plea agreement would be read more broadly than suggested by the receiver.  In
    our view, it was clearly open to the motion judge to accept the receiver’s
    assessment that a guilty plea to one count and an acquittal on all other
    counts under this plea agreement carried less risk of exposure to civil liability
    that a conviction on all counts. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assuming
    without deciding that the Richter was bound to consider White’s personal
    exposure to liability as a director, the degree of his exposure is at most
    no more than that of Ravelston.  We agree with the submission that the issue
    for the motion judge was whether it was better to plead guilty under <i>this</i> plea
    agreement or proceed to trial, not whether some better plea agreement could
    be imagined.</p>

    see no reason to interfere with the thorough and balanced decision of the
    motion judge.  Accordingly, assuming that leave to appeal is required, we
    would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.  The parties are at liberty
    to make brief written submissions as to the costs of the appeal, the respondents
    to file their submissions within ten days of the release of these reasons,
    and the appellants to file theirs within ten days thereafter. </p>
