    respondent Bo Li was charged with the second degree murder of his wife Kiu
    Shang.  He admitted that he strangled her to death, but advanced two defences
    at trial.  First, he denied that he intended to kill her. In the alternative,
    he sought to raise the defence of provocation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    trial judge found that the defence of provocation had an air of reality,
    and thus charged the jury on it.  The jury acquitted the respondent of second
    degree murder and convicted him of manslaughter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown appeals the respondent’s acquittal.  While it does not quarrel with
    the charge on provocation itself, the Crown argues that the trial judge erred
    in finding that the defence had an air of reality in the circumstances of
    this case, and says that it therefore should not have been left to the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I conclude that the trial judge did not err in putting
    the defence of provocation to the jury.</p>

line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge had to decide whether there was some evidence upon which a properly
    instructed jury could reasonably decide the issue.  See <i>R. v. Fontaine </i>(2004),
    183 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at para. 14  (S.C.C.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown acknowledges that there was evidence of wrongful acts and insults by
    the victim, but argues that these acts and insults fell so short of being
    sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of self-control that the objective
    component of the defence had no air of reality.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the Crown argues that there was so little linkage between these acts and
    insults and the respondent’s loss of control that the subjective component
    of the defence also had no air of reality.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent and the victim were both university students from abroad, far
    away from home and family. Despite family pressure, they married in December
    2002, some eight months before the victim’s death.  Although the couple did
    not move in together until July 1, 2003, they had spent about eighty percent
    of their nights together since May 2002.  During the month before the killing,
    the respondent spent some nights at another apartment that he had rented
    due to his wife’s examination schedule, but continued to see her regularly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the night in question, August 25, 2003, the respondent met the victim after
    she finished writing an examination and they returned to the apartment. There
    was evidence that she had done badly on the examination and was in a foul
    mood. They began arguing, and there was evidence that she commenced insulting
    the respondent repeatedly, culminating in a very derogatory insult in their
    native language.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was evidence that events then unfolded to include the following:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The

line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The

    smoking.</p>

line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    victim demanded proof of his devotion to her and then ridiculed him when
    he offered to jump from the kitchen window as proof of that devotion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    victim attempted to provoke him into assaulting her by slapping him in the
    face.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    the respondent left the apartment and retreated to the elevator, the victim
    followed him out of the apartment, screaming and yelling insults at him,
    and hitting him from behind.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    neighbour made it known that they were being observed, causing the respondent
    great embarrassment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent dragged the victim back into the apartment, where she continued
    to scream and yell at him, seriously insulting him again, and again slapping
    his face.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent turned to leave even though he was very angry, but the victim
    hit him in the back.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent testified that he then swung his arm back very strongly at her,
    knocking her into the kitchen wall and causing her to bleed profusely from
    her head.  She began to scream loudly and he began choking her, which ultimately
    caused her death.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown argued that the victim’s conduct would be no more than <i>de minimis </i>for
    the ordinary person, and that it would never cause such a person to lose
    self-control.  The Crown says this does not therefore meet the objective
    component of the test for provocation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    cannot agree.  While I think the trial judge correctly described the evidence
    as weak, I agree with him that there was some evidence from which a properly
    instructed jury could reasonably decide that this component of the provocation
    defence was met, at least to the point of raising a reasonable doubt.  Put
    negatively, I cannot say that this evidence is so thin that no properly instructed
    jury could reasonably come to that conclusion.  Putting all the factors together,
    a reasonable jury could have a reasonable doubt that they would cause an
    ordinary person to lose self-control.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning
    to the subjective component, the Crown relies heavily on the respondent’s
    evidence that when the victim was bleeding and began to scream, he went into
    shock but was not angry, and that this was when he started to choke her.  The
    Crown argues that this shows that the killing could not have been provoked
    by the victim’s earlier conduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not agree.  The jury need not have viewed the act of killing as a discrete
    episode unconnected to the earlier events of the evening. It would have been
    open to them to view all of these events as a single transaction, with the
    provocation continuing up to the point where the victim hit the respondent
    from behind. On this view, the respondent swung his arm back at her as his
    loss of self-control began, and it immediately escalated to her strangulation.  While
    the respondent said he was not angry at that point, the extreme violence
    of the killing was more than enough for the jury to infer that he was acting
    in a rage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary, I agree with the trial judge that there was some evidence upon which
    a properly instructed jury could reasonably decide the issue of provocation.
    It was for the jury to decide whether this evidence was enough to raise a
    reasonable doubt that the killing was provoked.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown also argues that the charge on reasonable doubt was flawed.  I do not
    agree.  That charge is conceded to track the language in <i>R. v. Lifchus</i> (1997),
    118 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).  While that charge tells the jury that a reasonable
    doubt may arise from a lack of evidence tendered at trial, when the trial
    judge charged the jury on provocation he very clearly spelled out their task.
    They would have been in no doubt about how to proceed to determine whether
    or not the defence had been established and would not have relied on an absence
    of evidence.  Indeed, the Crown does not complain about the provocation charge
    itself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown also argues that in his recharge the trial judge invited the jury to
    speculate on what might have occurred after the victim started bleeding from
    the head and that that could have constituted a provocative act. Again, I
    do not agree. The entire thrust of the recharge was to the benefit of the
    Crown in that it made clear to the jury that they could not consider the
    fact that the victim screamed in pain as a provocative act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    conclusion, none of the Crown’s arguments succeed. The appeal must be dismissed.</p>
