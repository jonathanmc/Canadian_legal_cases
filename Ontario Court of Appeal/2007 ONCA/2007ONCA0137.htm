lang=EN-US>On appeal from endorsements of Justice E. Eva Frank dated December
    5, 2005 and January 20, 2006.</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Radvar raises two fundamental grounds of appeal: one, the
    release executed by him in the prior action does not preclude the action that
    was the subject of the summary judgment motion and two, the release does not
    protect the respondents AG Canada, Signum and Rye from legal action by the
    appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regarding the first ground, the motion judge, in our view,
    correctly found that the wording of the release is unambiguous and therefore
    amounts to a bar of the within action.  Its language provides that only a dispute that “had not emerged or a
    question which had not at all arisen” will fall outside the scope of it.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence put before the motion judge plainly reveals that
    when Mr. Radvar executed the release, he was aware that his private information
    had been obtained by illegal means.  Further, it establishes that he knew the essential elements of the
    claims in this action.  In deciding the
    motion, it was not necessary for the motion judge to make any credibility
    assessments or findings.  The motion
    judge correctly noted that any conflict in the evidence was with respect to the
    subjective intentions of the parties.  Those intentions are not relevant to the determination of contractual
    intent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second ground by Mr. Radvar is that, because the
    respondents Signum, Rye and AG Canada were not parties to the release, they
    could not benefit from it.  We agree
    with the motion judge.  There are two
    reasons why this argument must fail.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the release specifically provides that it applies to Chubb’s
    agents.  This, therefore, includes
    Signum and Rye.  Second, all of the
    claims against each of the respondents including AG Canada find their factual
    underpinnings in the precise facts to which the release applies.  This case is different from <i>Van Patter v. Tillsonburg District Memorial
    Hospital</i> (1999), 45 O.R. (3d) 223 (C.A.). As the motion judge put it:
    “there are no claims against AG Canada that are not subject to a cross-claim
    against the co-defendants”.  We agree
    with her conclusion that “it would be unjust to permit the action against the
    Attorney General of Canada to proceed while preventing it from advancing its
    cross-claims against its co-defendants”.  See <i>Sinclair-Cockburn Insurance
    Brokers Ltd. v. Richards</i> (2002), 61 O.R. (3d) 105.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, Mr. Radvar failed to meet the burden of showing
    that there is a triable issue as to whether some unexpected situation emerged
    after the execution of the release.  In
    this action, Mr. Radvar effectively seeks to ignore a bargain he made with full
    knowledge of the very same circumstances that existed when he agreed to and
    entered into the bargain.  The motion
    judge correctly dismissed his action to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed with costs,
    inclusive of GST and disbursements, of $15,000 for the respondent Chubb,
    $15,000 for the respondents Signum and Rye, and $10,000 for the respondent AG
    Canada.</p>
