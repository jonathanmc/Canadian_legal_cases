  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the conviction
    entered by Justice Dyson of the Superior Court of Justice on March, 27, 2004.</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raised six grounds of appeal.  At the outset, he abandoned two.  We found it necessary to call on the Crown
    only on two of the remaining grounds.  We address those two grounds below:</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Admissibility
    of the statements</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises three arguments on the admissibility of
    the statements.  First, the trial judge
    did not apply the proper burden of proof.  Second, he failed to adequately consider the appellant’s explanation and
    the other evidence favouring the defence.  Third, the trial judge failed to attach sufficient weight to the police
    failure to follow their guidelines for videotaped statements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the trial judge never made specific reference to the
    test in <i>R. v. W.</i>(<i>D</i>). (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.), he was clearly alive to
    the obligation on the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
    statement was voluntary.  On a fair
    reading of the trial judge’s reasons as a whole, we see no error in the way he
    approached the burden of proof.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In eight pages of his eleven-page ruling, the trial judge
    canvassed all the evidence, including that of the police officers at the
    station, as well as the appellant’s evidence, that of his relatives and the
    medical evidence.  If not explicitly,
    then at least implicitly, the trial judge accepted the evidence of the police
    officers and the video, in which the appellant exhibited no signs of
    injury.  Moreover, the trial judge’s
    reasons for not relying on the evidence of the doctor or the brother (as
    supporting the appellant’s evidence that he was beaten) are implicit both in
    his comments in his ruling and in his comments made during the submissions
    leading up to that ruling.  In our view,
    his ruling taken together with the exchanges during submissions, are also
    sufficient for the purpose of appellate review.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are not satisfied that the trial judge erred in the way he
    dealt with the failure of the police officers to follow the guidelines set out
    in the police manual regarding the taking of videotaped statements.  That said, clearly, it is important that the
    procedures in the manual be followed.  Had the police done so in this case, it may well have avoided the issues
    that consumed a considerable amount of trial and appeal court time.  While we are not allowing the appeal in this
    case, we wish to emphasize, as this court has in the past, the importance of
    the police following the guidelines. </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>Vetrovec</span></i><span
lang=EN-US> caution</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>During
    the pretrial conference, the trial judge agreed to give a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning about the evidence of the accomplices.  Apparently, through inadvertence, that
    warning was not included in the charge to the jury.  The defence did not object to this omission.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This
    was an unusual case because, while both accomplices gave <i>K.G.B. </i>statements implicating the appellant, they resiled from
    those statements at trial.  Instead, at
    trial, the accomplices gave evidence that, if accepted, fully exculpated the
    appellant, explaining, in the case of one accomplice, that the <i>K.G.B.</i> statement had been physically
    coerced and, in the case of the other, that he gave his statement while on
    drugs and angry and with the belief that he would be given something in return. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While
    it may have been preferable had the trial judge given the warning requested by
    the appellant, in our view, in the circumstances of this case, the failure to
    do so is not fatal.  Any <i>Vetrovec </i>warning would undoubtedly have
    applied not only to the <i>K.G.B.</i> statements, but also to the trial statements that were favourable to the
    appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>What
    the trial judge did do was to give a specific caution about the reliability of
    the <i>K.G.B.</i> statements, noting that
    the statements were not subject to cross-examination and may have been obtained
    by coercion.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Moreover,
    the issues about the credibility and reliability of the accomplices, including
    their background and their lifestyle, were central to the case.  The jury would have been alive to this
    evidence, which was reviewed during the submissions to the jury.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
    well, given the exculpatory nature of their trial evidence, the accomplices
    were more in the nature of defence witnesses, for which a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning would be inappropriate.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    absence of any objection to the omission of the <i>Vetrovec</i> warning, while not determinative, appears to have been a
    strategic decision on the part of the appellant’s trial counsel.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
