  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment of
    Justice Randall Echlin of the Superior Court of Justice dated June 10, 2005.</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is an appeal from the judgment of Echlin J., who
    dismissed the appellant’s insurance claim on the basis that coverage was
    excluded by the terms of the policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Strategic Associates Inc. (Strategic), was the
    receiver for Hinterhoeller Yachts (Hinterhoeller).  Hinterhoeller purchased export credit insurance from the
    respondent, Export Development Canada (EDC), for the purpose of permitting it
    to extend credit to non-Canadian purchasers of its Nonsuch boats. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When Hinterhoeller went into receivership, it had not been
    paid for three boats: two had been delivered to a U.S. dealer, Eastern Yacht
    Sales Inc. (Eastern) and the third had been shipped to Spain.  Eastern sought to return the boats because
    Hinterhoeller was no longer able to fulfill its warranty obligations, as a
    result of which the dealer was limited to selling the boats on an “as is, with
    all faults and defects” basis. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hinterhoeller, through Strategic, claimed for its losses under
    the EDC policy. EDC denied coverage.  The trial judge dismissed Strategic’s ensuing action against EDC.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the appellant argues that the trial judge erred in
    failing to apply correct principles of interpretation; in finding as a fact
    that the U.S.  Dealer Policy formed part
    of the export contract within the meaning of the policy; in failing to find
    certain terms of the policy ambiguous, thus invoking <i>contra proferentem</i> in favour of the insured; and, finally, in his
    assessment of damages. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It appears that the trial judge blended<i> </i>the issue of whether the insured proved its loss with the
    insurer’s burden, if so alleged, that the exclusion applied.  The law is well settled that insurance
    coverage must be approached in two stages.  First, the insured must prove that its loss is covered by the policy.
    Second, if the insured proves such a loss, the onus shifts to the insurer to
    establish the exclusion.  Coverage
    provisions are interpreted broadly and exclusions provisions narrowly. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of the trial judge’s error, this court must apply the
    correct law to the facts as found by the trial judge, provided the trial judge
    made no palpable and overriding error in arriving at his factual conclusions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The main claim on this appeal is with respect to the U.S.
    boats and these reasons first address that claim.  We then address the second issue regarding the appellant’s claim
    for consequential losses for the boat delivered to Spain.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the undisputed facts found by the trial judge, in our view
    the appellant clearly established that its losses for the U.S. boats came
    within the policy; in particular, under s. 3(1) that provides coverage for
    losses resulting from “the buyer not paying for goods delivered to and accepted
    by the buyer”.  The insured established
    at trial that the boats were delivered and accepted and that Eastern did not
    pay.  This was sufficient to prove the
    loss.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since the loss was covered, we turn to the question of the
    exclusion, remaining mindful of the onus on the insurer to prove the exclusion,
    and the requirement to interpret exclusions narrowly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The policy specifically excluded coverage where “the buyer
    does not accept or pay for the goods because of a dispute between the Exporter
    and the buyer with respect to the export contract” (s. 20(2).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises two issues regarding the interpretation
    of this exclusion: the interpretation of “export contract” and of “dispute”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The documents encompassed by the term “export contract” were
    central at trial. After hearing evidence on the issue about the purchase order,
    the warranties shipped with the boat, and the U.S. Dealer Policy provided to
    Eastern, the trial judge concluded that the Dealer Policy, which contained
    warranties, formed part of the export contract.  In our view, there was ample evidence to support this finding,
    including reference to terms on the purchase order that could only be
    understood by reference the Dealer Policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, there was no issue at trial that Hinterhoeller
    provided warranties; the only dispute was whether those warranties appeared in
    the owner’s manual delivered with the boat or in the U.S. Dealer’s policy
    earlier provided to Eastern.  While the
    trial judge concluded that the Dealer Policy formed part of the export
    contract, and that finding is supported by the evidence, in our view, whether
    those warranties appeared in the Dealer Policy or in the owner’s manual is of
    no moment.  Indeed, the respondent’s
    case is even stronger because the warranties were delivered with the boat, as
    the appellant conceded. Consequently, the purchase order for the boat included
    the warranties.  Either way, the trial
    judge was entitled to conclude that the warranties formed part and parcel of
    the export contract. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We turn then to the interpretation of “dispute”.  On this issue, Eastern did dispute payment
    for the boats and it did so because it took the view that, due to the
    receivership, Hinterhoeller was unable to fulfill its warranties. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Dispute” is not defined in the policy and to that extent is
    ambiguous.  On this issue, the
    respondent concedes that the insurer cannot rely on a frivolous dispute to
    exclude coverage because such an interpretation would be inconsistent with the
    very purpose of the policy.  The
    respondent concedes that to exclude coverage, the dispute must be legitimate or
    tenable.  We agree. In this case, the
    dispute is clearly a legitimate one as evidenced by the letter from Eastern’s
    U.S. counsel setting out its position under applicable U.S. law. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since the insurer established that the exclusion applies, the
    result below should not be disturbed.  Accordingly, the appeal with respect to the two boats shipped to Eastern
    must be dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regarding the second issue of the consequential losses flowing
    from the recovery of the boat shipped to Spain, these losses are submitted as
    s. 16 costs under the policy. Under s. 16, the costs had to be approved by
    EDC.  It is clear that they were not and
    we are satisfied that EDC acted reasonably in refusing to give its approval for
    these costs.  We are supported in this
    view by the trial judge’s conclusion that he could find only a small proportion
    of the special damages were satisfactorily established by the appellant and the
    small proportion that was established related to all three boats. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We did not call on the respondent with respect to punitive
    damages.  Given our disposition of the
    appeal, it is unnecessary for us to deal with this issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the appeal is dismissed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs are awarded to the respondent fixed in the amount of
    $15,000 inclusive of Goods and Services Tax and disbursements.</p>
