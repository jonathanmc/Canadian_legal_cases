    Ontario Court of Justice dated August 12, 2005.</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant accepts that absent a non-blameworthy
    explanation, the driving in this case constitutes a marked departure from the
    standard of care required of a reasonable person in the circumstances.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that there was no evidence to support a
    non-blameworthy inference.  Specifically, she found that there was no evidence to support an
    inference that the appellant unexpectedly fell asleep as a result of sleep
    apnea.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no error in this finding.  It was open to the trial judge to reject Dr. Lipsitz’s opinion,
    given that the opinion, as the appellant candidly accepts, was weak.  Dr. Lipsitz had not examined the appellant
    until seventeen months after the accident and at that point found only a very
    mild form of sleep apnea requiring no treatment.  Moreover the appellant did not testify that he fell asleep  unexpectedly; he had amnesia with respect to
    the events surrounding the accident.  Significantly, the appellant had never experienced occasions where he
    unexpectedly fell asleep either before or after the accident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the trial judge made a positive finding that the fact
    the appellant straddled the centerline and corrected himself shortly before the
    accident  “…evidences knowledge of his
    lack of control of his vehicle”.  This
    finding was available to her on the evidence.  There was ample basis on the facts as found by the trial judge to
    support a conviction for dangerous driving.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The appellant raises
    arguments about the manner in which the trial judge conducted the trial.  We see no basis to interfere.  We need address only two of those
    arguments.  First, the appellant argues
    that in the middle of the trial, the trial judge improperly directed a police
    officer to determine whether the road was banked at the scene of the accident
    as a civilian witness had testified.  Leaving aside whether such a direction, if given, was appropriate, we
    note that defence counsel agreed to the filing of the officer’s report and
    declined the opportunity to cross-examine the officer on it.  Further, we note that the Crown could have
    called this evidence in reply in any event.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the appellant argues that the trial judge erred in the
    manner that she handled Exhibit 21, an agreed statement of fact.  In our view, nothing turns on this issue
    given that the trial judge accepted the portion of the agreed statement that
    was important to the defence, namely that the appellant had amnesia and was not
    feigning it.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown concedes that the conviction for dangerous driving <i>simpliciter</i> should be quashed as the
    appellant was not arraigned on that charge.  The trial judge did not mention this charge in her reasons for
    convicting the appellant and the conviction apparently resulted from a clerical
    error.  In the result, the appeal is
    dismissed with the exception that the appeal against the conviction for
    dangerous driving <i>simpliciter</i> is
    allowed and that conviction is quashed.  </p>
