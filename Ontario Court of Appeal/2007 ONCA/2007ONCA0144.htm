  <p><b>On appeal from the adult sentencing decision of Justice David Salmers
      of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting in youth justice court, dated

      November 24, 2005 and the placement decision of Justice Salmers dated March
      24, 2006.</b></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'>BY THE COURT:</h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'>I.          OVERVIEW</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are concerned in these appeals with the provisions of the <i>Youth Criminal
    Justice Act</i>, S.C. 2002, c. 1 (the “YCJA”) that permit the sentencing
    of young persons as adults and that require, in certain circumstances, the
    placement of young persons in penitentiaries or provincial correctional facilities
    for adults to serve their sentences.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants A.O. and J.M. were charged on a sixty-five count indictment with
    a series of armed robberies of convenience stores.  Following a preliminary
    inquiry, they were committed to stand trial on sixteen convenience store
    robberies and one robbery of a delivery person.  They subsequently pled guilty
    to six of the convenience store robberies and the remaining counts were withdrawn.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the appellants were only sixteen years of age when the robberies were committed
    in the spring of 2003, by the time of their arrests on the predicate offences,
    both appellants had significant youth records and were subject to multiple
    probation orders.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown applied under s. 72 of the YCJA to have the appellants sentenced as
    adults.  On November 17, 2005, Salmers J. of the Superior Court of Justice,
    sitting in youth justice court, granted the Crown’s applications.  On November
    24, 2005, he imposed sentences of five years imprisonment on each appellant,
    after giving them three years credit for approximately two and a half years
    spent in pre-sentence custody.  Subsequently, on March 24, 2006, the youth
    court judge directed that the appellants serve their sentences in the penitentiary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants appeal from the youth court judge’s decision to sentence them
    as adults, from the length of the sentences imposed, and from the decision
    that they should serve their sentences in the penitentiary.  The appellant
    A.O. also seeks to challenge the constitutionality of s. 110(2)<i>(a)</i> of
    the YCJA, which provides that the publication ban established by s. 110(1)
    of the YCJA does not apply to a young person who receives an adult sentence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    was one of the first cases under the YCJA in which the Crown sought to have
    young persons sentenced as adults.  The record indicates that the youth court
    judge and trial counsel approached the issues and procedures in this case
    with considerable care.  In particular, the youth court judge’s reasons are
    comprehensive and reflect thoughtful attention to the requisite factors to
    be balanced under the YCJA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    one exception, we see no basis to interfere with the youth court judge’s
    decisions.  For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the youth court
    judge erred in his assessment of certain of the expert evidence relevant
    to the determination of whether A.O. should serve his sentence in the penitentiary.  As
    a result, his placement decision concerning A.O. cannot stand, and a new
    placement hearing for this appellant is required.  Accordingly, both A.O.
    and J.M. are granted leave to appeal.  A.O.’s appeal is allowed in part and
    J.M.’s appeal is dismissed in its entirety.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'>II.        FACTS</h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'>(1)       Circumstances of the Offences</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Four
    of the six robberies were recorded on video security tapes maintained in
    the convenience stores.  We viewed parts of these tapes.  We agree with the
    youth court judge that the robberies were well-planned, violent and terrifying.  They
    were carried out by the appellants and an adult accomplice late at night,
    when only one store clerk was on duty in each of the stores and no customers
    were present.  The appellants and their accomplice dressed entirely in black
    and wore balaclavas, hoods and gloves.  In five of the robberies, one of
    the robbers used a knife and, in the sixth robbery, an imitation firearm
    was employed to threaten, intimidate and control the convenience store clerk.  Neither
    appellant could be identified as the robber who wielded the knife or the
    imitation gun.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each
    of the store clerks was traumatized and four of them sustained serious knife
    wounds.  In one instance, the store clerk was severely beaten and stabbed.  Several
    clerks now suffer from permanent injuries arising from the robberies.  All
    six clerks remain fearful of working at night.  They all experienced financial
    losses due to their injuries and consequent loss of work.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the following description by the youth court judge of the nature
    of the offences:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The offences of [A.O.] and [J.M.] involved planning,
    dis-guises, weapons, and gratuitous violence.  They committed their offences
    while on probation and breaching terms that placed them on a curfew and ordered
    them to stay apart.  The victims were vulnerable – alone at night.  Several
    of the clerks were immigrants to this country, working in a vulnerable situation
    in one of the few jobs available to them as they strived to get ahead in
    this country.  These hard-working men suffered physical, financial, and psychological
    damage.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Considering all of these factors, I find that the
    offences of [A.O.] and [J.M.] were extremely serious.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><span>            </span>(2)       Circumstances
    of the Offenders</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the adult sentencing hearing, detailed evidence of the appellants’ personal
    circumstances was admitted, including psychological and psychiatric evidence.  Written
    reports from Dr. Peter Marshall, a psychologist, and Dr. Richard Meen, a
    psychiatrist, were filed.  Both of these experts testified about their assessments
    of the appellants.  In addition, various social workers, probation officers
    and youth service workers testified as to the progress and conduct of the
    appellants while in custody, and as to their future prospects. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><i>(i)        Circumstances of A.O.</i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the evidence of these witnesses, A.O. is not without admirable traits that
    bespeak some hope for his future.  He was described by Drs. Marshall and
    Meen as an intelligent young person for whom a university education is a
    realistic possibility.  Following his arrest on the predicate offences and
    while he was detained at youth custody facilities, A.O. successfully completed
    his high school diploma.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A.O.
    informed the youth court judge that after his release from custody, he wishes
    to work part-time, take university business classes, start his own business,
    help his family and continue counselling for his problems.  These are responsible
    goals that the experts regarded as achievable by A.O.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence also established that A.O.’s peers tend to see him as a leader and
    that he is an independent decision-maker.  The youth court judge concluded
    that A.O. is
    “very street-wise” and that he had the maturity of an adult when he committed
    the offences in issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    other evidence at the adult sentencing hearing depicted A.O. in a dif-ferent
    and disturbing light.  The experts indicated that A.O. has a high risk of
    recidivism, that considerable time will be necessary to reduce this risk,
    that A.O. has a history of manipulative and deceitful conduct, and that he
    exhibits entrenched antisocial attitudes and behaviours.  Dr. Meen was of
    the view that A.O. suffers from a conduct disorder exemplified by his lack
    of remorse and empathy for his victims.  The experts, among other witnesses,
    agreed that there is no “quick fix” for A.O. and that he still requires significant
    treatment.  The youth court judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The best type of programs for him are functional
    or skills-based programs that involve educational and vocational training. …Based
    on his past behaviour after release from custody, and the apparent inability
    of his parents to influence and control him, I am not satisfied that he would
    pursue the necessary treatment and programs upon his release from secure
    custody.  If he did not pursue the necessary treatment and programs, I find
    that he would relapse into a criminal lifestyle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A.O.
    also has a significant youth court record dating from February 2002.  It
    includes findings of guilt on charges of robbery, assault, obstructing police,
    carrying a concealed weapon, and breach of probation.  The predicate offences
    were committed while A.O. was subject to three separate probation orders.  A.O.’s
    record suggests that he first became involved in criminal activity when he
    was twelve or thirteen years old and that, since that time, he has often
    been in custody and almost continuously on probation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    his arrest in May 2003, A.O. was detained primarily at Brookside Youth Centre.  While
    at that facility, he was involved in a disciplinary incident that concerned
    an attempt by him, together with J.M., to bring marijuana to a scheduled
    court appear-ance.  Subsequently, after an unrelated incident in which A.O.
    was attacked by other youths at Brookside, A.O. was transferred to the Hamilton-Wentworth
    Detention Centre, Youth Unit, where he was detained at the time of his adult
    sentencing hearing.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><i>(ii)       Circumstances of J.M.</i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence concerning J.M. at the adult sentencing hearing established some
    similarities, but also several important differences, between J.M. and A.O.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>J.M.
    appears to have engaged in a criminal lifestyle and drug use since he was
    about thirteen years old.  J.M.’s mother moved her family from the Jane and
    Finch corridor in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto to
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Pickering, in an effort to remove J.M. from negative peer influences.  J.M.,
    however, returned to the Jane and Finch area to engage in drug trafficking.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Like
    A.O., J.M. has a serious youth court record dating from the spring of 2002.  It
    includes findings of guilt for assault, robbery, drug possession and breach
    of probation.  The commission of at least two of these offences (the assault
    and the breach of probation) included A.O.’s involvement.  Also like A.O.,
    J.M. breached a subsisting probation order when he committed the predicate
    offences.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>J.M.
    was detained at
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Brookside after his arrest on the predicate offences.  As we have said, while
    J.M. was in custody, he and A.O. were involved in an attempt to transport
    marijuana to a scheduled court appearance.  Subsequently, in mid-December
    2005, when his placement hearing was pending, J.M. and two other youths attacked
    and beat a third youth at
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Brookside (the “Brookside Incident”).  The victim required medical attention
    for head injuries sustained in this attack.  As a result of this altercation,
    J.M. was transferred to Sprucedale Youth Centre.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Marshall described J.M. as having limited intellectual skills and a grade
    five literacy level.  Dr. Meen testified that J.M. has a history of
    “significant ambivalent attachment disorder”, leading to the development
    of an antisocial lifestyle “aligned with conduct disordered peers”.  This
    assessment was supported by the evidence of other witnesses, including J.M.’s
    social worker and the author of his pre-sentence report.  Moreover, several
    witnesses testified that J.M. lacks both remorse for his offences and genuine
    empathy for his victims.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Psychological
    testing of J.M. indicated that he has an
    “above average” risk of recidivism.  The youth court judge accepted that
    since J.M.’s arrest in 2003 and throughout his detention, he has maintained
    contact with “undesirable friends”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    contrast to A.O., J.M. has a history of academic and other problems in school.  He
    struggled academically and dropped out of high school before the predicate
    offences were committed.  He resumed his schooling only when incarcerated.  His
    goals, ex-pressed to the youth court judge, are to finish high school, get
    a job in the construction industry, and continue with various vocational
    and counselling programs.  The youth court judge regarded J.M.’s employment
    aspirations as realistic and attainable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    youth court judge found that J.M. engages in his own decision-making and,
    in that regard and in his attitude towards certain of his family members,
    he exhibits some mature characteristics.  The youth court judge also found
    that, like A.O., J.M. is “very street-wise” and had the maturity of an adult
    when he engaged in the convenience store robberies.  However, he also concluded
    that J.M. is immature intellectually and, in some respects, behaviourally.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'>III.       ISSUES</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issues in these appeals may be framed as follows:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'>            (1)       In concluding that the appellants should be sentenced
    as adults, did the youth court judge err:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'>                        (i)        by applying the wrong onus of proof;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;

  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:

    about the appellants’ rehabilitative potential?</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;'>            (2)       Did the youth
    court judge err in sentencing the appellants:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:

           by failing to afford adequate credit for the appellants’ pre-sentence

    preliminary issue arises in this case because of the appellants’ lengthy
    (two and a half years) pre-sentence custody.  Before the youth court judge,
    counsel for the appellants conceded that an additional period of time in
    custody was appropriate.  In fact, they urged the judge to impose the maximum
    youth sentence (two years custody and one year community supervision).  The
    Crown submits that it would not have been open to the youth court judge to
    impose a three-year youth sentence, in light of the pre-sentence custody.  She
    relies upon the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <i>R. v. Fice</i> (2005),
    196 C.C.C. (3d) 97 where the court held that a conditional sentence under
    s. 742.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 was not available
    where, together with the pre-sentence custody, the effect would be the imposition
    of a penitentiary sentence.  We need not decide this difficult issue because
    we are satisfied that the maximum youth sentence, even in addition to the
    substantial pre-sentence custody, would not be sufficient to hold the appellants
    accountable for their offending behaviour.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i>(i)        Onus of Proof</i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    72(1)<i>(b)</i> of the Act sets out the criteria that a youth justice court
    must consider and the test it must apply when determining if an adult sentence
    is required for a young person.  The section reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>72.(1)  In making its decision on an application
    heard in accordance with section 71, the youth justice court shall consider
    the seriousness and circumstances of the offence, and the age, maturity,

    factors that the court considers relevant, and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:

    imposed in accordance with the purpose and principles set out in subparagraph
    3(1)<i>(b)</i>(ii) and section 38 would not have sufficient length to hold
    the young person accountable for his or her offending behaviour, it shall
    order that an adult sentence be imposed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant
    to s. 72(2), when the Crown seeks to have a youth justice court impose an
    adult sentence on a young person, it bears the onus of “satisfying” the court
    as to the matters referred to in subsection 1<i>(b)</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    considering whether to impose an adult sentence in this case, the youth court
    judge held that there was “a very heavy onus” on the Crown to satisfy him
    that a youth sentence would not have sufficient length to hold A.O. and J.M.
    accountable for their offending behaviour.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>J.M.
    argues that the youth court judge erred by applying an onus of proof that
    was too low.  He argues that a youth justice court can impose an adult sentence
    only if the Crown proves beyond a reasonable doubt that one is required under
    s. 72(1)<i>(b)</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not accept J.M.’s submission.  The normal meaning of the language of ss.
    72(1)<i>(b)</i> and 72(2) does not require proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  Section
    72(1)<i>(b)</i> requires a youth justice court to impose an adult sentence “if
    it is of the opinion” that a youth sentence is insufficient.  The phrase “is
    of the opinion” does not equate to the level of certainty that attaches to
    a requirement for proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    72(2) refers to an onus of “satisfying” the youth justice court of the matters
    necessary for the imposition of an adult sentence.  This wording tracks the
    language considered by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. M. (S.H.)</i> (1989),
    50 C.C.C. (3d) 503 at 546-8 when it assessed the nature of the onus on a
    party seeking a transfer to adult court under the <i>Young Offenders Act</i>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. Y-1, as rep. by S.C. 2002, c.1, s. 199 (the pre-1995 provisions).  Justice
    McLachlin, as she then was, distinguished an onus “to satisfy” from the criminal
    onus of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  Speaking for the majority, she
    said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Parliament set out in detail the factors which
    must be weighed and balanced, and stipulated that if after considering them
    the court was satisfied that it was in the interests of society and the needs
    of the young person that he or she should be transferred, the order should
    be made.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Nor do I find it helpful to cast the issue in terms
    of civil or criminal standard of proof.  Those concepts are typically concerned
    with establishing whether something took place.  It makes sense to speak
    of negligence being established “on a balance of probabilities”, or to talk
    of the commission of a crime being proved “beyond a reasonable doubt”.  But
    it is less helpful to ask oneself whether a young person should be tried
    in ordinary court
    “on a balance of probabilities”.  One is not talking about something which
    is probable or improbable when one enters into the exercise of balancing
    the factors and considerations set out in s. 16(1) and (2) of the <i>Young
    Offenders Act</i>.  <i>The question rather is whether one is satisfied, after
    weighing and balancing all the relevant considerations, that the case should
    be transferred to ordinary court</i>.  [Emphasis added.]      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    72(1)<i>(b)</i> requires the youth justice court to weigh and balance the
    enumerated factors and then to decide whether a youth sentence is sufficiently
    long to hold a young person accountable for his or her offending behaviour.  That
    type of evaluative decision – making an informed judgment – does not lend
    itself to proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  As McLachlin J. explained in <i>R.
    v. M. (S.H.), supra</i>, the court is not being asked to make findings of
    fact about past events nor to make a determination of whether a crime has
    been committed, which are the types of decisions for which proof beyond a
    reasonable doubt is normally required.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    arguing that the proper onus is proof beyond a reasonable doubt, J.M. relies
    upon this court’s decision in <i>R. v. B. (D.)</i> (2006), 206 C.C.C. (3d)
    289.  In particular, J.M. refers to Goudge J.A.’s statement at para. 63: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[I]n sentencing, the Crown must assume the burden
    of demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that there are aggravating circumstances
    in the commission of the offence that warrant a more severe penalty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, this passage does not support J.M.’s argument.  In the quoted passage,
    Goudge J.A. was not referring to the youth justice court’s decision whether
    to impose an adult sentence.  Rather, he was referring to the proof of aggravating
    circumstances relating to the offence itself.  Clearly, the Crown bears the
    onus of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the factual circumstances that
    are relevant to the court’s decision-making process when considering whether
    to impose an adult sentence.  The requirement of proof beyond a reasonable
    doubt does not, however, extend to the ultimate decision called for under
    s. 72(1)<i>(b)</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, we do not accept J.M.’s argument that the youth court judge imposed
    an improperly low burden of proof upon the Crown.  That said, we recognize
    that the decision to impose an adult sentence upon a young person is a very
    serious one and should only be taken after careful consideration of all the
    relevant factors.  As the youth court judge pointed out, the imposition of
    an adult sentence can lead to very severe consequences for the young person.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    youth court judge reasoned that in order to ensure that the most serious
    interventions are reserved for the most serious crimes, as mandated by the
    preamble to the YCJA, the burden of proof is not mere satisfaction, but rather “a
    very heavy onus to satisfy”, as he put it.  With respect, we would not describe
    the onus in those terms.  Section 72(2) imposes an onus of satisfying the
    court, nothing more.  However, in applying that onus, it is important that
    a youth justice court bear in mind the very serious consequences of an adult
    sentence for the young person, so as to only order an adult sentence when
    necessary to fulfil the objectives of the YCJA. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><i>(ii)       Approach to Accountability </i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the youth court judge erred in several respects in
    his interpretation of the test for imposing an adult sentence.  In particular,
    they submit that he erred in his appreciation of accountability, which is
    the central feature of the decision whether to impose an adult sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    appreciate the appellants’ argument, it is necessary to set out the relevant
    provisions of the YCJA.  The starting place is s. 72, which establishes the
    test for im-posing an adult sentence.  For convenience, we again set out
    s. 72 in full:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>72. (1) In making its decision on an application
    heard in accordance with section 71, the youth justice court shall consider
    the seriousness and circumstances of the offence, and the age, maturity,
    character, background and previous record of the young person and any other
    factors that the court considers relevant, and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>(a)</i>    if it is of the opinion that a youth
    sentence imposed in accordance with the purpose and principles set out in
    subparagraph 3(1)<i>(b)</i>(ii) and section 38 would have sufficient length
    to hold the young person accountable for his or her offending behaviour,
    it shall order that the young person is not liable to an adult sentence and
    that a youth sentence must be imposed; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>(b)</i>    if it is of the opinion that a youth
    sentence imposed in accordance with the purpose and principles set out in

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    can be seen, s. 72 directs the sentencing judge back to the purpose and principles
    set out in s. 3(1)(<i>b</i>)(ii) and s. 38 of the Act:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3. (1) The following principles apply in this Act:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:

  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(<i>b</i>) the criminal justice system for

    is consistent with the greater dependency of young persons and their reduced
    level of maturity[.] [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>38. (1) <i>The purpose of sentencing under section
      42 (youth sentences) is to hold a young person accountable for an offence

      into society</i>, thereby contributing to the long-term protection of the
      public. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>        (2) A youth justice court that imposes
    a youth sentence on a young person shall determine the sentence in accordance
    with the principles set out in section 3 and the following principles:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(<i>a</i>) the sentence must not result in a punishment

    the same offence committed in similar circumstances;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(<i>c</i>) the sentence must be proportionate to
    the seriousness of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the young
    person for that offence;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(<i>d</i>) all available sanctions other than custody
    that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all young
    persons, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal young
    persons; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(<i>e</i>) subject to paragraph (<i>c</i>), the
    sentence must</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i) be the least restrictive sentence that is capable

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii) be the one that is most likely to rehabilitate
    the young person and reintegrate him or her into society, and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii) promote a sense of responsibility in the
    young person, and an acknowledgement of the harm done to victims and the
    community.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3) In determining a youth sentence, the youth
    justice court shall take into account</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(<i>a</i>) the degree of participation by the young

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(<i>b</i>) the harm done to victims and whether

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(<i>c</i>) any reparation made by the young person

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    combined effect of ss. 72, 3 and 38 is to identify accountability as the
    purpose that the youth court judge must consider when deciding an application
    to impose an adult sentence on a young person.  Accountability is achieved
    through the imposition of meaningful consequences for the offender and sanctions
    that promote his or her rehabilitation and reintegration into society.  The
    purpose of accountability in this context would seem to exclude accountability
    to society in any larger sense or any notion of deterrence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    view of accountability is consistent with the
    “offender-centric” nature of a youth sentencing decision identified by the
    Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. P. (B.W.); R. v. N. (B.V.)</i> (2006),
    209 C.C.C. (3d) 97. In that case, the court held that general deterrence
    is not a factor in youth sentencing.  Speaking for the court at para. 33,
    Charron J. said the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
class=loose1><span style='color:black'>In the same way, when the statute speaks
        of “accountability” or requires that “meaningful consequences” be imposed,
        the language expressly targets the young offender before the court: “ensure
        that <i>a young person</i> is subject to meaningful consequences” (s.
        3(1)(<i>a</i>)(iii));
    “accountability that is consis-tent with <i>the greater dependency of young
    persons</i> and <i>their</i> reduced level of maturity” (s. 3(1)(<i>b</i>)(ii));
    “be meaningful <i>for the individual young person</i> given his or her needs
    and level of development” (s. 3(1)(<i>c</i>)(iii)). Parliament has made it
    equally clear in the French version that these principles are offender-centric
    and not aimed at the general public[.] [Emphasis in original.]</span></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    s. 38 sets out principles of sentencing that could have individual as well
    as societal purposes, these must be read in light of the purposes of sentencing
    in the youth justice context.  Thus, for example, s. 38(2)(<i>c</i>) sets
    out as a principle of sentencing that the sentence must be proportionate
    to the seriousness of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the
    young person for that offence.  In the context of the YCJA, proportionality
    must be seen as providing an upper limit on the sentence that can be imposed
    on the offender.  In other words, even if a long sentence were deemed necessary
    to rehabilitate the offender and hold him or her accountable, the sentence
    still must not be longer than what would be proportionate to the seriousness
    of the offence and the offender’s degree of responsibility.  That is not
    a concern in this case.  The offences in this case are so serious that an
    upper limit fixed by the principle of proportionality would not be less than
    what might be necessary to hold the offenders accountable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    the question in this case is what is meant by the terms accountability, meaningful
    consequences, rehabilitation and reintegration.  One obvious point is that
    meaningful consequences cannot be synonymous with rehabilitation and reintegration.  Parliament
    has used the different terms and is presumed to have intended different meanings.  See
    for example, <i>R. v. Barnier</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 1124 at 1135-36; <i>Winko
    v.
    <st1:State w:st="on">

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In
    our view, accountability in this context is the equivalent of the adult sentencing
    principle of retribution as explained by Lamer C.J.C. in <i>R. v. M. (C.A.)</i> (1996),
    105 C.C.C. (3d) 327 (S.C.C.) at paras. 80 and 81:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Retribution in a criminal context, by contrast,
      represents an objective, reasoned and measured determination of an appropriate
      punishment which properly reflects the <u>moral</u> <u>culpability</u> of
      the offender, having regard to the intentional risk-taking of the offender,
      the consequential harm caused by the offender, and the normative character
      of the offender’s conduct</i>. Furthermore, unlike vengeance, retribution
      incor-porates a principle of restraint; retribution requires the imposition
      of a just and appropriate punishment, and <u>nothing more</u>. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center;'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Retribution, as well, should be conceptually distinguished
    from its legitimate sibling, denunciation. Retribution requires that a judicial
    sentence properly reflect the moral blame-worthiness of that particular <u>offender</u>.
    The objective of denunciation mandates that a sentence should also commun-icate
    society’s condemnation of that particular offender’s <u>conduct</u>. In short,
    a sentence with a denunciatory element represents a symbolic, collective
    statement that the offender’s conduct should be punished for encroaching
    on our society’s basic code of values as enshrined within our substantive
    criminal law. [Underlining in original, italics added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, for a sentence to hold a young offender accountable in the sense
    of being meaningful it must reflect, as does a retributive sentence, “the
    moral culpability of the offender, having regard to the intentional risk-taking
    of the offender, the consequential harm caused by the offender, and the normative
    character of the offender’s conduct”.  [Underlining omitted.] We see no other
    rational way for measuring account-ability.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    need to consider the normative character of an offender’s behaviour necessarily
    requires the court to consider societal values.  But what the court cannot
    do is add on to a youth sentence an element of general deterrence or denunciation.  This
    concept of accountability is consistent with this court’s decision in <i>R.
    v. W. (R.E.)</i> (2006), 205 C.C.C. (3d) 183 at paras. 40-42, where the court
    noted the focus of the YCJA on the best interests of the young person, and
    at para. 43, in which it considered the exceptional circumstances in which
    a court can impose a custodial disposition under s. 39(1)(<i>d</i>) of the
    Act:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The scheme of the YCJA suggests that the exceptional
    case gateway can only be utilized in those very rare cases where the circumstances
    of the crime are so extreme that anything less than custody would fail to
    reflect societal values. It seems to me that one example of an exceptional
    case is when the circumstances of the offence are shocking to the community.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    view of the meaning of accountability is also consistent with the other principles
    of sentencing to which the youth court judge is directed under s. 38, especially
    those set out in ss. 38(3)<i>(a) </i>and <i>(b)</i>: degree of participation,
    harm to the victim and whether the harm was intentional or reasonably foreseeable.  These
    principles speak to retribution as defined by Chief Justice Lamer in <i>R.
    v. M. (

    court judges have reached similar conclusions as to the meaning of account-ability
    in s. 72.  As Blacklock J. said in <i>R. v. J.M.</i>, [2004] O.J. No. 2796
    (C. J.) at para. 26, the sentence must “be long enough to reflect the seriousness
    of the offence before the Court and the accused’s role in it”, even taking
    into account the offender’s increased dependence and decreased maturity.  We
    read this as recognition of the need to take into account the normative character
    of the offender’s conduct.  And in <i>R. v. Ferriman</i>, [2006] O.J. No.
    3950 (S.C.J.) at para. 38, McCombs J. said that for a sentence to hold a
    young person accountable it must achieve two objectives:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It must be long enough to reflect the seriousness
    of the offence and the offender’s role in it, and it also must be long enough
    to provide reasonable assurance of the offender’s rehabilitation to the point
    where he can be safely reintegrated into society. If the Crown proves that
    a youth sentence would not be long enough to achieve these goals, then an
    adult sentence must be imposed. [Footnote omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the youth court judge erred when he, in effect, included
    an element of denunciation in the concept of accountability.  The impugned
    passage from the youth court judge’s reasons on the adult sentence application
    is as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Society in general expects an element of punishment
    or retribution in almost every sentence for crimes, including for offending
    behaviour of young persons. The <i>YCJA</i> also acknowledges retribution
    as a factor in the youth criminal justice system
    – see various subsections of sections 3 and 38. Accordingly, while the protection
    of the public through effective rehabilitation and reintegration into society
    is the most important element when considering young persons’
    accountability to society in general, it is not the only consideration. The
    court must also consider whether society in general would view the sentence
    as providing appropriate punishment or retribution for the young person’s
    offending behaviour.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is this approach to accountability that I have
    applied in considering the Crown’s application for adult sentences for [A.O.]
    and [J.M.]. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    passage could be read as invoking a notion of accountability to society that
    might include an element of denunciation.  However, we do not consider that
    the youth court judge made a reversible error in the circumstances of this
    case.  Some of the language in this passage would better have been avoided.  Nonetheless,
    we think that the youth court judge principally had in mind the normative
    character of the appellants’ conduct when he was considering how society
    might view the sentences and when he adverted to accountability to society
    in general.  On that scale, the available youth sentence would not be adequate
    to hold these offenders accountable.  These offences were carried out with
    such brutality and recklessness as to the consequences to the victims that
    only lengthy sentences of imprisonment would properly represent meaningful
    consequences for these youths.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants also submit that the youth court judge erred in his approach to
    rehabilitation.  They argue, in effect, that he misapprehended the requirements
    of the YCJA and the Crown’s onus concerning rehabilitation at an adult sentencing
    hearing.  Specifically, A.O. maintains that the youth court judge erred by
    concluding that under the scheme of the YCJA, the sentence imposed on a young
    person must be sufficient to “secure” his or her rehabilitation.  J.M. contends
    that in order for a young person to be sentenced as an adult, it is incumbent
    on the Crown to establish that the young person “cannot be rehabilitated
    by a youth sentence”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    reject these submissions.  We agree with the Crown that the youth court judge’s
    approach to rehabilitation was consistent with the purposes and principles
    of sentencing under the YCJA and that he did not err in his appreciation
    of the Crown’s onus regarding rehabilitation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the beginning of his reasons in support of his adult sentencing decision,
    the youth court judge explicitly acknowledged that the Crown bore the onus
    under s. 72(1)<i>(b)</i> of the YCJA to satisfy him “that a youth sentence,
    imposed in accordance with the purpose and principles of the YCJA, would
    not have sufficient length to hold [the appellants] accountable for their
    offences”.  Thus, from the outset, the youth court judge correctly identified
    the Crown’s burden and focused on the accountability assessment required
    by the YCJA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    youth court judge then instructed himself that the purposes and principles
    of the YCJA stress that “young persons are to be held accountable through
    sentences that have meaningful consequences for the young person and promote
    rehabilitation and reintegration into society, thereby protecting the public
    in the long term”.  This instruction conforms with s. 38(1) of the YCJA and
    is also consistent with the object of the YCJA set out in s.&nbsp;3(1). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    youth court judge next considered the evidence in the case and evaluated
    the appellants’ prospects for rehabilitation in the context of assessing
    whether a youth sen-tence would be sufficient to hold the appellants accountable
    for their offences.  This approach properly treated rehabilitation as one,
    but only one, of the important factors that are integral to the accountability
    inquiry mandated by ss. 72(1)<i>(b)</i> and 38(1) of the YCJA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary
    to A.O.’s submission, in so doing, the youth court judge did not hold that
    a youth sentence must be sufficient to “secure”
    the rehabilitation of a youthful offender, in the sense of ensuring that
    outcome.  As acknowledged by A.O., in most cases, this would be virtually
    impossible to predict.  There is no guarantee that any sentence, however
    skilfully fashioned, will ensure the rehabilitation of an offender.  What
    is required under the YCJA is that the sentence imposed has meaningful consequences
    for the affected young person and that it promotes his or her rehabilitation
    and reintegration into society.  The youth court judge directed himself to
    this requirement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    also do not accept J.M.’s contention that the Crown’s burden on an adult
    sentencing application extends to proof that a young person cannot be rehabilitated
    by a youth sentence.  The Crown’s burden under s. 72(1)<i>(b)</i> of the
    YCJA is to satisfy the youth court judge, on consideration of all relevant
    factors, that a youth sentence would be of insufficient length to meet the
    base requirement of accountability that drives the entire YCJA sentencing
    regime. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants also argue that the youth court judge erred in his assessment
    of the evidence about their rehabilitative potential.  A.O. attacks, on various
    grounds, the youth court judge’s conclusion that he lacked the capacity or
    commitment to be
    “effectively rehabilitated during the length of a youth sentence that could
    be imposed under the YCJA”.  A.O. submits that the youth court judge erred
    by seeking to fashion a sentence that would ensure, rather than promote,
    A.O.’s rehabilitation, by misconstruing or ignoring Dr. Meen’s evidence of
    A.O.’s capacity to change, by failing to address the possibility that A.O.
    had progressed and begun to change his thinking during his lengthy pre-sentence
    custody, and by taking an unduly pessimistic view of A.O.’s progress based
    on his conduct in custody.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would not give effect to these submissions.  The youth court judge’s reference
    to the
    “effective” rehabilitation of A.O. does not constitute reversible error.  Read
    in context, we take this reference to reflect nothing more than the youth
    court judge’s view, based on the evidence of A.O.’s needs, condition and
    circumstances, that the length of time that could be afforded by the imposition
    of a youth sentence was insufficient to foster A.O.’s rehabilitation in a
    meaningful and realistic fashion.  In effect, the youth court judge concluded
    that a youth sentence would not sufficiently promote A.O.’s rehabilitation
    to meet the requirement of accountability established by the YCJA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are also not persuaded that the youth court judge erred in his appreciation
    of Dr. Meen’s evidence of A.O.’s capacity and commitment to change.  While
    it is true that Dr. Meen testified that A.O. “without question…has the capacity
    for change”, he qualified this statement by saying, “[t]he issue is whether
    he will realize it or not.”  By this statement, Dr. Meen questioned the likelihood
    of the realization of such change in the future.  This was consistent with
    Dr. Meen’s concerns, prompted by his perception of A.O.’s glibness and history
    of manipulation, that A.O.’s conduct potentially might reflect only “superficial”
    compliance.  Thus, Dr. Meen expressed reservations about the genuineness
    of A.O.’s commitment to real change.  This was confirmed by Dr. Meen later
    in his evidence when he said that without further extensive assessment of
    A.O., he could not determine whether A.O. “was really able to make the necessary
    changes in his thinking”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    do we accept that the youth court judge erred by failing to have regard to
    A.O.’s progress in detention, or by adopting an unduly pessimistic perspective
    on A.O.’s rehabilitative progress.  In his reasons, the youth court judge
    adverted to many of A.O.’s accomplishments and positive behaviour while in
    custody, especially at
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Brookside.  He expressly found that A.O. had made progress towards rehabilitation
    while he resided at that facility.  The youth court judge, however, assessed
    the significance of this progress in the context of other important factors
    that called into question A.O.’s capacity for and commitment to the changes
    required to become rehabilitated and reintegrated into society.  It was entirely
    appropriate for the youth court judge to weigh the evidence of A.O.’s rehabilitative
    prospects in this fashion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    also reject J.M.’s argument that the youth court judge misapprehended J.M.’s
    prospects for rehabilitation.  The record simply does not support this contention.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    errors alleged by J.M. fall into two categories.  First, he submits that
    the youth court judge erred by concluding that the length of time required
    for J.M.’s rehabilitation would exceed three years.  J.M. maintains that
    only Dr. Meen testified about the length of time required for J.M.’s rehabilitation
    and that his evidence does not support the youth court judge’s conclusion
    that a youth sentence would be of insufficient length to meet the purposes
    and principles of sentencing outlined in the YCJA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is inaccurate.  Both Drs. Marshall and Meen testified that J.M.’s personality
    and behavioural problems are deeply ingrained.  Given J.M.’s problems, Dr.
    Marshall said that it could take years to effect his rehabilitation.  Dr.
    Meen agreed that J.M.’s rehabilitation “could obviously take more than two
    years”.  He said that although J.M. is capable of change “with reliable supports
    in the community”, there is “no quick fix” for J.M. given the antisocial
    components of his personality.  In addition, these witnesses and others indicated
    that J.M. still requires significant counselling, treatment, educational
    and vocational training.  Finally, as observed by the youth court judge,
    J.M.’s own proposed plan for his future treatment, counselling and programming “would
    take years to complete”.  We see no error in the trial judge’s appreciation
    of this evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    in an appendix to his factum filed with this court, J.M. listed a series
    of alleged errors by the youth court judge in his assessment of the evidence,
    which J.M. claims constitute either errors in principle or a failure to give
    proper effect to the evi-dence concerning J.M.’s rehabilitative potential.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again,
    we disagree.  In respect of each of the errors asserted by J.M., there was
    either evidence to support the impugned finding by the youth court judge
    or the evidence relied upon by J.M. to demonstrate the alleged error is actually
    consistent with the finding in issue.  In respect of some of the alleged
    errors, there is no basis in the youth court judge’s reasons upon which to
    conclude that he ignored or otherwise failed to consider the evidence relied
    upon by J.M.  The youth court judge simply assessed the evidence on the disputed
    issues differently than the manner contended for by J.M.  It was open to
    him to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Distilled
    to its core, the appellants’ challenge to the youth court judge’s assess-ment
    of the evidence of their prospects for rehabilitation is really an attack
    on his factual findings concerning the appellants’ rehabilitative potential.  Absent
    palpable and over-riding error, those findings attract great deference from
    this court, especially where, as here, they form part of a youth court judge’s
    reasoning in support of the decision to sentence a young person as an adult.  We
    are satisfied that the appellants have not met the exacting standard required
    for appellate intervention with the impugned findings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    we reject without hesitation J.M.’s complaint that the youth court judge’s
    adult sentencing ruling falls short of the standard for sufficiency of reasons
    established by <i>R. v. Sheppard</i> (2002), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 298 (S.C.C.)
    and related cases.  There is no basis for this assertion.  As we observed
    at the outset, the youth court judge’s reasons are commendably detailed and
    thoughtful.  They amply reveal his reasoning process and permit meaningful
    appellate review.  This ground of appeal has no merit.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'>(2)       Sentences Imposed</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    youth court judge sentenced each of the appellants to a total of eight years
    imprisonment.  He gave three years credit for the two and a half years they
    had served in pre-sentence custody.  As a result, each appellant was sentenced
    to an additional five years imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants appeal the length of their sentences.  They argue that the youth
    court judge erred by failing to give them adequate credit for pre-sentence
    custody.  They also argue that he erred by relying too heavily on general
    deterrence and that the totality of their sentences – eight years – is outside
    the appropriate range for these types of cases.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the sentences imposed were fit having regard to the seriousness
    of the offences and the circumstances of the appellants.  The youth court
    judge carefully considered all the appropriate sentencing factors and we
    see no basis to interfere with the sentences that he imposed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    turn first to the issue of pre-sentence custody.  The youth court judge gave
    the appellants credit on a ratio of 1.2:1.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    rationales for giving enhanced credit for pre-trial and pre-sentence custody
    are well established.  In <i>R. v. Francis</i> (2006), 207 C.C.C. (3d) 536
    at para. 14, this court summarized the relevant considerations as follows:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.        Other than for life sentences, legislative
    provisions for parole eligibility and statutory release do not take into
    account time spent in pre-sentence custody;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.        There are few rehabilitative, educational
    or retraining programs available in detention centres; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.        Conditions in detention facilities are
    often more crowded and more onerous than in correctional facilities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    fairness requires that a sentencing judge should not deny credit for pre-sentence
    custody without good reason, a sentencing judge has broad discretion regarding
    how much credit to give.  The courts have resisted mandating a fixed ratio
    or multiplier to pre-trial custody, preferring to leave this to the discretion
    of the sentencing judge who can assess what would be fair in the circumstances:  <i>R.
    v. Wust</i> (2000), 143 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (S.C.C.) and <i>R. v. Francis</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at paras. 23-25.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, we are satisfied that it was within the youth court judge’s discretion
    to give three years credit for the two and a half years the appellants spent
    in pre-sentence custody.  The youth court judge carefully explained the reasons
    for his decision.  He noted that the appellants had been detained in youth
    facilities where the conditions were not harsh as they are in many adult
    detention facilities.  He also noted that the facilities in which the appellants
    were held had excellent treatment, counselling, educational and vocational
    programs and that the appellants had taken advantage of many of those programs.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Significantly,
    two of the factors referred to in <i>Francis</i>, <i>supra</i>, that warrant
    enhanced credit – namely, the absence of rehabilitative programs and the
    relatively onerous conditions – were not present in this case.  In our view,
    the factors considered by the youth court judge were appropriate.  We see
    no error in his decision to give credit for pre-sentence custody on a 1.2:1
    basis. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    to general deterrence, while this is not a factor in imposing a youth sentence,
    it is a factor when imposing an adult sentence on a young person.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  In this case, the youth court judge properly
    took into account the very serious circumstances of the six offences for
    which the appellants were convicted and attached appropriate weight to the
    need to deter others from committing similar offences in the future.  It
    is well established that the proprietors of small businesses, such as variety
    stores, that are open late at night are particularly vulnerable to the types
    of violent crimes committed by the appellants.  As a result, they deserve
    special protection by the courts.  In addition, deterrence is important when
    sentencing individuals who have perpetrated violence in groups.  As the youth
    court judge pointed out, general deterrence was important in this case given
    the prevalence of these types of crimes in the community.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    general deterrence was an important consideration in this case, the youth
    court judge appropriately balanced it with the appellants’ youth, their decreased
    maturity and their rehabilitative potential.  He engaged in a lengthy and
    thorough examination of the appellants’ pre-sentence reports and other psychological
    evidence and considered their individual needs and circumstances.  He also
    reviewed their behaviour since arrest, including their involvement in incidents
    requiring disciplinary action at their correctional facility.  He noted that
    the appellants had attempted to bring marijuana in the vehicle transporting
    them to the courthouse.  Given all this evidence, the youth court judge concluded
    that the appellants lacked “the capacity or commitment to be effectively
    rehab-ilitated during the length of a youth sentence”.  The sentences he
    imposed were the shortest possible sentences to accomplish all the appropriate
    sentencing objectives.  We see no error in the youth court judge’s reasoning
    or in his approach to sentencing the appellants.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    we are of the view that the sentences totalling eight years fall within the
    appropriate range for these types of offences and offenders.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    there is no basis on which to interfere with the sentences imposed.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    this placement disposition is not mandatory in all circumstances.  It does
    not apply where the youth justice court is satisfied either that such placement
    would not be in the best interests of the young person, or that it would
    jeopardize the safety of others.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, both A.O. and J.M. were eighteen years or older at the time of
    sentencing and both were sentenced to more than two years imprisonment.  Thus,
    the placement of both appellants in a penitentiary or a provincial correctional
    facility for adults was obligatory unless the youth court judge was persuaded
    that one or both of the exceptions under s. 76(2) applied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    youth court judge concluded that neither exception was made out on the evidence
    in respect of the appellants.  Because no evidence was led before him regarding
    provincial correctional facilities for adults, including about whether placement
    in those facilities might be in the best interests of either appellant, the
    youth court judge directed that the appellants serve their sentences in the
    penitentiary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants do not contest the youth court judge’s articulation of the placement
    test under s. 76.  Rather, they argue that in considering the “best interests” and “safety
    of others” exceptions under s. 76(2), the youth court judge erred in his
    treatment of the expert evidence at the placement hearing of Marc Levine,
    the Provincial Co-ordinator of Assessment, Placement and Transfer for the
    Youth Justice Services Division of the Ontario Ministry of Children and Youth
    Services.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    youth court judge ruled that all the evidence heard on the Crown’s adult
    sentencing application and at the sentencing hearing was admissible at the
    placement hearing.  In addition, two witnesses testified at the placement
    hearing: Marc Levine and Greg Slaght, the Unit Manager at Sprucedale.  Documentary
    evidence was also filed at the hearing, including written placement reports
    concerning both appellants prepared by Mr. Levine pursuant to s. 76(4) of
    the YCJA, and various institutional reports and other documents regarding
    the conduct and progress of the appellants during their pre-sentence detention
    in youth custody facilities.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his placement reports, Mr. Levine recommended that A.O. remain in a youth
    custody facility.  In contrast, he recommended that J.M. serve his sentence
    in the adult penitentiary system.</p>
  <br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A.O.
    submits that the youth court judge improperly discounted Mr. Levine’s recommendation
    that A.O. be kept in a youth custody facility.  J.M. argues that the youth
    court judge erred by failing to take into account a “significant modification”
    by Mr. Levine to his original opinion concerning the appropriate placement
    for J.M., and by failing to exercise “appropriate care” in rejecting Mr.
    Levine’s evidence and that of youth custody corrections staff concerning
    the appropriate placement for J.M.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree that the youth court judge erred in his approach to A.O.’s placement
    by failing to evaluate Mr. Levine’s evidence concerning an appropriate placement
    for A.O.  We see no error, however, in his consideration of Mr. Levine’s
    evidence regarding J.M.’s placement.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i>(i)        A.O.’s Placement</i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    youth court judge’s analysis of an appropriate placement disposition for
    the appellants focused on the circumstances of each offender, including their
    progress in custody, their educational, vocational and counselling needs,
    their ages, and the length of their sentences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect of A.O., and in stark contrast to J.M., the youth court judge found
    that this youth has pursued his goals and rehabilitation and has exhibited
    maturity in his conduct while detained in youth custody facilities.  The
    youth court judge indicated that A.O. “seems to be motivated and [is] making
    genuine progress towards rehabilitation and reintegration into society”.  While
    these positive factors may have attested to the benefits of the youth custody
    system for A.O., ultimately the youth court judge was not satisfied on the
    evidence that requiring A.O. to serve his sentence in the penitentiary would
    not be in his best interests.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    connection with Mr. Levine’s evidence, the youth court judge acknowledged
    that Mr. Levine was “very knowledgeable and experienced in the youth custody
    system” and that his reports and his testimony
    “fully examined the effect on each offender’s best interests should that
    offender be placed in a youth custody facility”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the youth court judge regarded Mr. Levine’s evidence as being of limited
    assistance to the court because Mr. Levine had
    “very little knowledge of the provincial adult correctional system or the
    penitentiary system”.  The youth court judge put it this way: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Mr. Levine’s] placement reports only assisted
    the court about whether, and the degree to which, a youth custody facility
    was capable of addressing the best interests of each offender.  The placement
    reports do not assist the court in deciding the issue of whether, or to what
    degree, the adult provincial or penitentiary systems address the best interests
    of each offen-der.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later
    in his placement ruling, the youth court judge reiterated this concern and,
    consequently, his approach to Mr. Levine’s evidence in relation to A.O.: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   As stated earlier, the usefulness of and the
    weight to be given to Mr. Levine’s placement report and testimony, is limited
    by Mr. Levine’s admitted lack of knowledge about the provincial adult and
    the penitentiary systems.  At best, Mr. Levine’s evidence and recommendation
    are limited to asses-sing the effectiveness of the youth custody system to
    address the best interests of [A.O.]. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is apparent that the youth court judge regarded the usefulness of Mr. Levine’s
    evidence as seriously undermined by his admitted lack of personal experience
    with and knowledge about the federal penitentiary system.  We agree that
    this was a proper consideration in assessing the weight to be afforded to
    Mr. Levine’s evidence.  However, the youth court judge’s reasons contain
    no evaluation of Mr. Levine’s placement recommendation for A.O., nor any
    mention of the basis for that recommendation as outlined by Mr. Levine in
    his report and testimony.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  With
    respect, this was an error.  While the limitation on Mr. Levine’s expertise
    identified by the youth court judge was a legitimate consideration in weighing
    his evi-dence, this factor did not justify discounting almost entirely his
    evidence regarding A.O.  We say this for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    as the youth court judge recognized, evidence of the federal penitentiary
    system relevant to the placement of A.O. was available from sources other
    than Mr. Levine.  This included an information pamphlet from Corrections
    Services Canada that outlined the programming available at federal penitentiaries,
    admitted during the testimony of Tom Windebank (Mr. Levine’s predecessor),
    and the evidence of Maurice White, a parole supervisor with Corrections Services
    Canada, at the adult sentencing hearing.  Thus, any gap in Mr. Levine’s knowledge
    concerning the penitentiary system was met by other admissible evidence.  Mr.
    Levine’s inability to offer this evidence did not detract from the value
    of his evidence concerning the benefits of the youth custody system for A.O.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    Mr. Levine’s evidence was highly relevant to A.O.’s prospects within the
    youth custody system for rehabilitation and reintegration into society and,
    hence, to the central issue of whether his interests would best be served
    if he were to remain within that system.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Levine listed fifteen factors in his placement report in support of his recommendation
    that A.O. serve his sentence in a youth custody facility.  These included:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Since
    entering HWDC [Hamilton-Wentworth Deten-tion Centre] he has been attacked
    on two occasions, once by a youth who attacked and stabbed [A.O.] with a
    homemade weapon, and recently he was
    “swarmed” by 7 youths.  In both situations [A.O.] only defended himself and
    did not fight back or retaliate.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center;'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    past November, [A.O.] <b>graduated</b> from high school, obtaining most of
    his credits while in deten-tion.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Concern
    that placement in either of the adult correc-tional systems will expose [A.O.]
    to negative influen-ces of serious adult offenders and as a result under-mine
    rehabilitative programming.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    lack of age-appropriate programming in the youth custody system for young
    persons age 18 or more, will be a challenge to the youth system.  Thus far,
    [A.O.] appears to be a positive influence on younger youth in HWDC.  His
    Social Worker describes him as a role model in the “day room”, who also volunteers
    for extra work and goes to school regularly.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That
    [A.O.] sees himself as a calm young person who understands the importance
    of an education.  If he remained in the youth system, he would concentrate
    on improving his grades (most are 70’s and 80’s), and attempt to gain access
    to University correspondence courses.  He ultimately would like to help troubled
    youths as part of his future.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center;'>….</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    a positive way, [A.O.] has really taken advantage of his stay in detention.  Aside
    from his education successes, [A.O.] has completed the 7 Step Program, attended
    counselling, learnt “self-help” techniques, was a Duke of Edinborough [<i>sic</i>]
    participant, acquired his propane licence, and was successful in a Brick
    and Stone Pre-Apprentice program. [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Levine’s final written recommendation regarding A.O.’s placement was expressed
    in these terms: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Recommendation:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is obvious to the writer that [A.O.] has made
    many gains while in detention.  His Social Worker at HWDC indicates that
    [A.O.] enjoys good relationships while at HWDC.  He is well behaved, respectful
    to women, attends programs, keeps a clean cell, stays away from negative
    behaviour, demonstrates positive leadership, is kind, humorous and intelligent
    and has shown he can control his impulses.  His Probation Officer and Social
    Worker feel [A.O.] would still benefit from remaining in the youth system,
    as [A.O.] has proven he does not pose a threat to other individuals.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Considering all of the above, it is suggested that
    [A.O.] should remain in the youth system and not be transferred to the adult
    system.  He can continue with his academic goals as well as have the opportunity
    to receive clinical and other supports while in the youth system.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>By his positive actions while in detention the
    past two plus years, [A.O.] has proven that he has all of the ability to
    succeed, and continues to benefit from the internal supports that the youth
    system has and can continue to offer him.  At the same time, he needs to
    persist and build on his successes or else he will have failed more than
    himself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    his testimony, Mr. Levine elaborated upon these views.  He said that A.O.
    was regarded by authorities at Hamilton-Wentworth as a “model prisoner” and
    a role model for other young persons in detention; that A.O.’s graduation
    from high school while in detention was a “quite rare” event in a youth centre;
    that A.O. exhibited
    “great restraint and great maturity” when confronted with violent or aggressive
    behaviour by others; and that A.O.’s behaviour while in custody was non-violent
    and non-threatening.  Mr. Levine also outlined the nature of the educational
    and counselling programming and supports available to A.O. in the youth custody
    system.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, Mr. Levine addressed the issue of A.O.’s age and its implications
    if A.O. remained in a youth custody facility.  In response to questioning
    by the youth court judge, Mr. Levine offered the opinion that it was appropriate
    for A.O. to remain in a youth custody facility for his full sentence, as
    long as his behaviour remained positive and he was gaining from the programs
    offered by the youth custody facility, even though this would mean that A.O.
    would reside, over time, with much younger offenders.  Indeed, in Mr. Levine’s
    view, A.O.’s placement in a youth custody facility would both favour A.O.’s
    rehabilitation and permit him to continue to act as a role model for younger
    residents.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    important evidence by Mr. Levine, which supported A.O.’s placement in a youth
    custody facility, required assessment by the youth court judge.  Although
    the youth court judge’s placement ruling regarding A.O. reflects sensitivity
    to A.O.’s circumstances and the requirements of the YCJA, the requisite evaluation
    of Mr. Levine’s recommendation about A.O.’s placement and his reasons for
    that recommendation was not undertaken. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the youth court judge’s treatment of Mr. Levine’s evidence about A.O. stands
    in marked contrast to his treatment of Mr. Levine’s evidence regarding J.M.’s
    placement.  In respect of J.M., the youth court judge noted Mr. Levine’s
    testimony that the influence on J.M. of negative peers was a concern if J.M.
    were to be placed in the penitentiary.  He went on to expressly address Mr.
    Levine’s placement recommendation for J.M., including what the youth court
    judge described as a “major basis of this recommendation”, namely, Mr. Levine’s
    fear for the safety of others if J.M. were to be placed in a youth facility.  The
    youth court judge then stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   The fact that a person like Mr. Levine, that
    is, a person very knowledgeable and very experienced in the youth custody
    system, did not recommend the youth custody system for [J.M.], even with
    the lessened safety concerns [due to J.M.’s good behaviour after the Brookside
    Incident], is a significant factor to consider when determining if the youth
    custody system is capable of addressing [J.M.’s] best interests, es-pecially
    effective rehabilitation and reintegration into society.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the youth court judge that Mr. Levine’s recommendation regarding
    J.M.’s placement was an important consideration.  But, Mr. Levine’s recommendation
    about A.O.’s placement was no less significant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the circumstances, on the basis of his ruling concerning A.O., we cannot
    be satisfied that proper regard was had by the youth court judge to Mr. Levine’s
    evidence concerning an appropriate placement for A.O.  Because this was important
    and highly relevant evidence bearing upon the placement decision for A.O.,
    the youth court judge’s placement ruling concerning A.O. cannot stand.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the new placement hearing concerning A.O. that we conclude is necessary,
    updated evidence regarding his conduct and progress in the youth custody
    system and additional focused information about the suitability of the federal
    penitentiary system for his placement may well be available.  It will be
    for the youth justice court to determine on the whole of the evidence adduced
    at that hearing whether it is not in A.O.’s best interests to serve his sentence
    in the penitentiary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A.O.
    recently turned twenty years of age.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a>  Since we would allow his appeal to the extent
    of ordering a new placement hearing under s. 76, the youth justice court
    will need to consider subsection (9) of that section.  This subsection provides
    that no young person shall remain in a youth custody facility after he attains
    the age of twenty years unless the youth court judge is satisfied that remaining
    in such a facility is in the best interests of the young person and would
    not jeopardize the safety of others.  This will be a factor for the youth
    justice court to consider on the new placement hearing.  We note that in <i>R.
    v. M.(J.), supra</i> and <i>R. v. Ferriman, supra</i> the youth justice court
    ordered, pursuant to s.&nbsp;76(9), that the offenders serve their adult
    sentences in youth custody facilities although they would reach the age of
    twenty years during the currency of their sentences.  Even if the judge makes
    an order under s. 76(9), an application to review that decision can be brought
    at some future time pursuant to s. 76(6).   </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><i>(ii)       J.M.’s Placement</i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    contrast to our conclusion regarding the youth court judge’s treatment of
    Mr. Levine’s evidence concerning A.O., we do not accept that the youth court
    judge misap-prehended or erred in his approach to Mr. Levine’s evidence about
    J.M.’s placement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    we have said, J.M.’s involvement in the Brookside Incident in December 2005
    led to his transfer to Sprucedale.  In his placement report regarding J.M.,
    Mr. Levine provided this description of the Brookside Incident:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]here is recent information to suggest [J.M.]
    has again jeopardized the safety of other youth[s] in custody.  There was
    a fight in mid December/05, a 3 person on 1, that [J.M.] was involved in.  An
    internal investigation showed that conflict was likely to continue, with
    [J.M.] at the forefront.  [J.M.] was eventually transferred to Sprucedale
    Youth Centre.  The victim was treated in the hospital for head injuries and
    charges were considered.  [J.M.] maintains that his involve-ment was a result
    of a misunderstanding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Levine also commented in his report, “[w]hile in Sprucedale Youth Centre
    in the last month, [J.M.] has been very well behaved and described as a model
    resident.  No apparent clinical issues.  Very motivated to achieve in school.” And, “[t]he
    writer has no doubt that [J.M.] has made many gains while in detention.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Levine also acknowledged in his report that J.M.’s probation officer was
    of the view that J.M. should remain in the youth system and that his social
    worker “expressed concerns an adult sentence will only serve to harden [J.M.]
    as he still grav-itates to negative influences”.  Mr. Levine, however, did
    not share these opinions.  Based on the Brookside Incident, Mr. Levine was
    concerned for the safety of others within the youth system should J.M. serve
    his sentence at a youth custody facility.  In his report, he stated, “[o]f
    significant concern to the writer is [J.M.]’s most recent involvement in
    a violent and physical altercation, part of a 3 on 1, peer on peer assault.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    his testimony, Mr. Levine indicated that notwithstanding J.M.’s positive
    behaviour at Sprucedale and the fact that his conduct had not deteriorated
    at that facility after learning of Mr. Levine’s adverse placement recommendation,
    Mr. Levine remained concerned that J.M. had chosen to involve himself in
    a serious altercation at Brookside in which another youth was beaten at a
    time when the determination of J.M.’s future place-ment was pending before
    the court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Read
    in its entirety, Mr. Levine’s evidence confirms that his placement recommendation
    concerning J.M. remained unchanged at the hearing, although he recognized
    and credited J.M. for his recent favourable conduct at Sprucedale.  The final
    exchange between Mr. Levine and J.M.’s counsel at the placement hearing captures
    the main thrust of Mr. Levine’s evidence on this issue:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Okay.  I guess to conclude and to go
    back to, I think, the initial question I asked you, <i>you obviously have
    some safety concerns still in terms of [J.M.]’s threat to others within a
    youth facility because of the December incident </i>[the Brookside Incident].<i>  Correct?</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        <i>Correct.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        <i>But those concerns, I guess, have
      lessened.  Is that a fair characterization, because of his behaviour since
      that point?</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        <i>I think there’s – I think it’s fair
      to say I think it’s still out there.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Right.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        But I’m certainly – he’s impressed me
    that he, he seems to have made a real commitment to stay out of trouble and,
    and when he knew what my recommendation was, he could have been very negative
    as a result and he’s chosen to go the other route instead of trouble and
    be that role model which is something we would want him to be.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Right.  And the, the, the staff at Sprucedale
    have an awareness of this December incident as far as you know?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        They would have.  Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        And they’ve indicated that they believe
    that they can deal with any security concerns that [J.M.] presents?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Absolutely.  They conveyed to me that
    they’re willing to work with him and, and if he’s given a – if he’s sent
    to a youth centre.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Thank you.  Those are my questions.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    these circumstances, in our view, the youth court judge did not err by con-cluding
    that J.M.’s continued contact with negative peers and his disciplinary problems
    while in custody demonstrated “that he is not yet learning from his arrest
    and time in custody”.  Nor did he err when he characterized the essence of
    Mr. Levine’s evidence this way:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   In his placement report, Mr. Levine recommended
    that [J.M.] serve his sentence in a penitentiary.  A major basis of this
    recommendation was the fact that, based on the mid-December 2005 fight, Mr.
    Levine feared for the safety of others if [J.M.] were to be placed in a youth
    facility.  <i>Mr. Levine did not go so far as to change his recommendation,
    even when he acknowledged that [J.M.]’s good behaviour, since the fight,
    lessened the safety concern for other inmates.</i> [Emphasis added.]   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    youth court judge was entitled to reject the placement recommendation of
    J.M.’s probation officer and, having taken the evidence of J.M.’s social
    worker, Mr. Levine and others into account, to conclude on all the evidence
    that J.M. should serve his sentence in the penitentiary.  We see no error
    in the youth court judge’s approach to or assessment of the evidence relevant
    to J.M.’s placement.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'>(4)       A.O.’s Constitutional Challenge</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    remains to consider A.O.’s challenge to the constitutionality of s. 110(2)<i>(a)</i> of
    the YCJA.  Section 110(1) of the YCJA states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Subject to this section, no person shall publish
    the name of a young person, or any other information related to a young person,
    if it would identify the young person as a young person dealt with under
    this Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    protection of privacy afforded by the publication ban established by s. 110(1)
    is not absolute.  Section 110(2)<i>(a)</i> provides that the ban does not
    apply “in a case where the information relates to a young person who has
    received an adult sentence”.  Thus, the ban is intended to extend only to
    those young persons to whom the youth corrections system applies.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the youth court judge decided to sentence A.O. as an adult, but before he
    imposed sentence, counsel for A.O. sought an order protecting A.O.’s identity
    or, in the alternative, allowing A.O. to challenge the constitutionality
    of s. 110(2)<i>(a)</i>.  The youth court judge declined both requests.  In
    respect of the constitutional issue, he ruled:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The offenders further submitted that there are
    constitutional problems because s. 110 of the YCJA may impose a reverse onus.  I
    disagree.  There is no notice of constitutional ques-tion served or filed
    in this matter.  Further, under s. 110 of the [YCJA], the publication ban
    is automatically terminated after imposition of the adult sentence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>To be successful in an application for an adult
    sentence the Crown bears a very heavy onus, as I outlined in my November
    17th reasons on the adult sentence applications.  At that time, I found that
    in this case, the Crown had met that very heavy onus.  Therefore, I disagree
    with the offenders’ submission on the constitutional issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    this court, A.O. again seeks to argue that s. 110(2)<i>(a)</i> is unconstitutional
    because it provides for the automatic lifting of the ban under s. 110(1)
    where a young person is sentenced as an adult pursuant to the YCJA.  For
    two reasons, we agree with the Crown that this court should decline to address
    this issue in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    although A.O. raised this issue before the youth court judge at the beginning
    of his sentencing hearing, A.O. failed to serve the requisite notice of a
    constitutional question on either the provincial or the federal Attorney
    General.  Consequently, neither Attorney was provided with proper notice
    of A.O.’s constitutional challenge.  Nor was any adjournment of A.O.’s sentencing
    hearing sought to permit the service of the requisite notices.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    because the required notices of a constitutional question were not delivered,
    neither Attorney was furnished with an adequate or timely opportunity to
    lead evidence in defence of the constitutionality of the impugned section
    of the YCJA.  In the result, no evidentiary foundation for A.O.’s constitutional
    challenge was established before the youth court judge.  Moreover, this court
    does not have the benefit of the youth court judge’s reasoning on the issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    these circumstances, where the evidentiary record before this court is insufficient
    to permit adjudication on the constitutional issue raised, where inadequate
    notice of the issue was provided to the applicable authorities, and where
    the youth court judge’s reasoning on the question is unavailable, we decline
    to exercise our discretion to consider this issue on the merits.  See <i>R.
    v. Rees</i> (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 122 (

    April 21, 2006, a panel of this court stayed the placement decision of the
    youth court judge concerning A.O. pending the hearing of his appeal and ordered
    that A.O. be returned to the youth facility.  This stay was extended pending
    the release of our reasons for judgment, but the stay was to expire on A.O.’s
    twentieth birthday in view of s. 93 of the YCJA, which provides that when
    a young person attains the age of twenty years he is to be transferred to
    the provincial correctional facility for adults to serve the remainder of
    the youth sentence unless the provincial director orders otherwise.  In December
    of 2006, while the case was still under appeal, A.O. applied for a further
    stay of the placement decision although he was about to turn twenty years
    of age.  The Crown agreed that this court had jurisdiction to make that order
    and fairly did not oppose the making of that order.  A.O. has thus remained
    in the youth facility.</p>
