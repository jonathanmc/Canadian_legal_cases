  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants raise two arguments in their main appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    they argue that neither all the facts nor the legal characterization that
    they seek to put on them in their proposed action have been litigated before,
    and that the motion judge erred in finding otherwise.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree.  The appellants acknowledge that essentially all the facts concerning
    the Receiver’s conduct have been known throughout, with the exception of
    the details that now may be available from the Receiver’s notes of a meeting
    on May 7, and a possible further cross-examination on those notes.  However
    from the beginning, the Receiver disclosed the meeting and who was present.  It
    would have been possible to obtain the notes through cross-examination in
    the prior proceedings but the appellants chose not to do so.  Moreover, it
    is hard to see what value would be added to the appellant’s proposed allegations
    by those notes.  Thus, with this minor exception all the facts have been
    previously scrutinized by the court and the Receiver’s conduct has been found
    entirely proper.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    to the proposed legal characterization of those facts, counsel told us that
    the allegations of negligence and breach of fiduciary duty have not been
    made in previous proceedings.  A perusal of the facta filed by counsel in
    those proceedings makes it obvious that that representation is not so.  The
    very allegations were indeed made in those terms, and, like the facts, have
    been scrutinized in previous proceedings.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    judges have expressly found that, given the facts and in spite of the arguments
    of the Receiver’s negligence and breach of fiduciary duty, the Receiver was
    throughout seeking to deal with the property prudently and fairly, and in
    a commercially reasonable manner.  The appellants’ arguments were obviously
    rejected.  The same facts and arguments were put before a third judge in
    opposing the order approving the sale, and while he gave no reasons, that
    judge also clearly rejected them because he granted the order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants have therefore litigated the same facts and arguments to final
    disposition against the Receiver not once but three times.  We agree with
    the motion judge that since the appellants, having previously chosen to put
    in issue before three courts the facts, and the arguments that the Receiver
    breached its duty of care and its fiduciary obligation, and having had those
    issues determined against them to the point of finality, issue estoppel dictates
    that they not be permitted to try a fourth time.  At the very least it would
    be an abuse of process to permit them to do so.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    light of this conclusion, we need not deal with the appellants’ second argument,
    namely that if issue estoppel does not apply, the motion judge erred in the
    test he applied to determine whether leave to commence the proposed action
    should be granted.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellants also seek leave to appeal the costs order below.  We see no
    reason to interfere with the discretion of the motion judge to award costs
    on a substantial indemnity scale. While the allegations made against the
    Receiver do not extend to fraud, they are allegations of a serious dereliction
    of duty by the Receiver.  Particularly in light of the fact that the appellants
    have sought unsuccessfully to raise these allegations again, and again, we
    see no error in the scale ordered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal must be therefore dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is dismissed with costs in the amount of $15,000.00 inclusive of disbursements
    and G.S.T.</p>
