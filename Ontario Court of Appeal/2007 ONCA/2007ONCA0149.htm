style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    October 12, 2006, the applications judge declared s. 453.01(1)(a) and (b)
    of the <i>Canada Elections Act</i>, S.C. 2000, c. 9, (the Act)<i> </i>invalid
    pursuant to s. 52 of the <i>Canadian</i> <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>,
    Part I of the <i>Constitution Act, 1982</i>, being Schedule B to the <i>Canada
    Act 1982</i> (U.K.), 1982, c. 11.<i> </i> Pending disposition of its appeal
    to this court, the Attorney General applies for a stay of two paragraphs
    of his order. </p>

    respondents on the motion are all registered political parties and their
    leaders. Blair T. Longley is the leader of the Marijuana Party; Kevin Peck
    is the chief agent of the Canadian Action Party; Miguel Figueroa is the leader
    of the Communist Party of Canada; and Jim Harris was the leader of the Green
    Party.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    proclamation of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>, the Supreme
    Court of Canada has had to consider the constitutionality of various limitations
    in both the provincial and federal elections acts.  In particular, in <i>Figueroa</i> v. <i>The
    Attorney General of Canada</i>, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 912, the Supreme Court considered
    whether the 50-candidate requirement for a registered party’s entitlement
    to benefits in the <i>Canada</i> <i>Elections Act</i>. (the Act), such as
    the right to issue tax receipts for donations made outside the election period,
    was inconsistent with s. 3 of the <i>Charter</i> dealing with a citizen’s
    right to vote and, if so, whether the infringement could be justified under
    s. 1. The Supreme Court declared these provisions unconstitutional but the
    declaration of unconstitutionality was suspended for 12 months.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the decision under appeal, the provision at issue entitles registered political
    parties to receive an additional measure of public funding (known as the
    quarterly allowance) in the form of $1.75 per vote per annum based on the
    level of voter support that the parties received in the previous federal
    election. Eligibility for this funding is restricted to parties that obtained
    2% of the national vote or 5% of the votes in electoral districts in which
    the party fielded candidates.<span

'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applications judge concluded that the Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Figueroa</i> applied
    to the provisions in issue before him. As a result, in paragraph 1 of his
    order, he declared the existing thresholds in s. 435.01(1)(a) and (b) of
    the Act null and void and of no force and effect. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paragraph
    2 of his order, which raises the main issue on this stay application, states: </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>THIS COURT ORDERS  that  s. 435.01(1)
    of the <i>Canada Elections Act</i> read as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>435.01(1) The Chief Electoral Officer shall determine,
    for each quarter of a calendar year, an allowance payable to a registered
    party whose candidates for the most recent general election preceding that
    quarter received at that election at least one vote.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>Thus, the applications judge read
    into section 435.01(1) a threshold of one vote. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paragraph
    3 of the applications judge’s order provides for the quarterly allowances
    to be paid from January 1, 2004 to September 30, 2006 plus prejudgment interest
    and sets out the amounts.  The applications judge reasoned that, as efforts
    made to persuade the government to repeal the impugned provisions after the
    release of the Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Figueroa</i> went unheeded,
    to deny the applicants this remedy would perpetuate the injustice of the
    government’s failure to introduce repealing legislation. He concluded that
    this harm could be remedied by paying the allowance retroactively so that
    all affected parties could approach the next federal election on the same
    footing as the major parties. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Attorney General asks that paragraphs 2 and 3 of the order of the applications
    judge be stayed on two bases: 1) that the Attorney General meets the requirements
    for obtaining a stay and 2) that the order in question is an order for the
    payment of money and is automatically stayed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent concedes that paragraph 3 of the order requiring payments retroactively
    from January 1, 2004 up to September 30, 2006 is an order for the payment
    of money and the filing of a notice of appeal automatically stays that portion
    of the order pursuant to Rule 63.01 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Attorney General argues that the prospective payments ordered in paragraph
    2 are also in effect an order for the payment of money.  The Attorney General
    submits that the same principles and considerations that underlie the automatic
    stay pending appeal of orders for the payment of money under Rule 63.01(1)
    apply.  I will deal with this aspect of the motion first.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Is the order with respect to
      prospective payments an order for the payment of money?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Courts
    have traditionally interpreted the application of rule 63.01(1) narrowly
    in terms of the kinds of orders that fall under it.  An order for the payment
    of money is an order that creates a fixed debt obligation: see para. 104
    of the dissenting opinion of Laskin J.A. in <i>Dickie v. Dickie</i> (2006),
    78 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.), aff’d 2007 SCC 8 and also <i>Lee v. Lee</i>,<i> </i>[1995]
    O.J. No. 1196 (Div. Ct.) <i><span> </span></i><span> </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    order in paragraph 2 applies not only to the applicants before the court
    but to “a registered party whose candidates for the most recent general election
    preceding that quarter received at that election at least one vote.”  While
    a consequence of paragraph 2 would be a monetary payment once the CEO has
    made his determination, the order itself is not a fixed debt obligation and
    is not an order for the payment of money.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>My
    conclusion is confirmed by the presence of section 435.02(3) of the Act which
    states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Receiver General shall, on receipt of a certificate,
    pay to the registered party out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund the amount
    set out in the certificate. ….</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>This is the section that provides
    for payment and creates an obligation.  There would be no reason for this
    section if s. 453.01(1) created an obligation to pay.  Thus, paragraph 2
    of the order is not an order for the payment of money within the meaning
    of rule 63.01(1). As it would not be appropriate to order an automatic stay,
    I must consider whether the requirements for ordering a stay pending appeal
    are met. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The requirements for a stay
      pending appeal </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    test for staying an order pending an appeal is the same as the test for an
    interlocutory injunction: <i>Circuit World Corp. v. Lesperance et al. </i>(1997),
    33 O.R. (3d) 674 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at 676-677.  First, a preliminary assessment must be made of the merits
    of the case to ensure that there is a serious question to be determined on
    the appeal.  Second, the court must determine if the appellant would suffer
    irreparable harm if the application were refused.  Finally, the balance of
    convenience must be determined by assessing which of the parties would suffer
    greater harm from the granting or refusal of the remedy pending a decision
    on the merits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    three requirements necessary to support the granting of a stay are not to
    be considered as separate hurdles but as interrelated considerations:  <i>Apotex
    Fermentation Inc. v. Novopharm Ltd. </i>[1994] M.J. No. 357 (C.A.).  Accordingly,
    strength respecting one criterion may compensate for the weakness of another: <i>Circuit
    World Corp., supra. </i>The overarching consideration is whether the interests
    of justice call for a stay: <i>International Corona Resources Ltd. v. LAC
    Minerals Ltd. </i>(1986), 21 C.P.C. (2d) 252 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Are the requirements for a
      stay met here?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Insofar
    as the first requirement is concerned, the appellants submit that the constitutionality
    of the sections in issue is clearly a serious question to be determined.  The
    words “a serious question to be determined” are equivalent to saying that
    their appeal is not frivolous and vexatious: <i>RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada
    (A.G.), </i>[1994]<i> </i>1 S.C.R. 311 at para. 44.   The appellant points
    out that in <i>Horsefield v. Ontario (Registrar of Motor Vehicles)</i> (1997),
    35 O.R. (3d) 304 (C.A.) this court held the threshold for satisfying this
    element of the test for a stay pending appeal is a low one. Further, statements
    in private law applications for interlocutory relief pending appeal, to the
    effect that once a decision has been rendered on the merits at trial the
    burden on an applicant for interlocutory relief increases, have no application
    in <i>Charter </i>cases:  <i>RJR-MacDonald Inc. v.
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    (A.G.), supra</i> at para. 47.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents submit the binding judgment of the Supreme Court in <i>Figueroa</i> is
    determinative and there are no serious issues to be determined. They rely
    on the following passage from <i>RJR-MacDonald, supra </i>at para. 33:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…the <i>Charter </i>charges the courts with the
    responsibility of safeguarding fundamental rights.  For the courts to insist
    rigidly that all legislation be enforced to the letter until the moment that
    it is struck down as unconstitutional might in some instances be to condone
    the most<i> </i>blatant violation of <i>Charter </i>rights.  Such a practice
    would undermine the spirit and purpose of the <i>Charter </i>and might encourage
    a government to prolong unduly the final resolution of the dispute.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept the respondents’ submission that the Supreme Court decision
    in <i>Figueroa</i> is determinative of the issues in this appeal and that,
    as a result, there is no serious issue to be determined. In <i>Figueroa</i>,
    Iacobucci J., writing for the majority, was clear at para. 91 that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This decision does not stand for the proposition
    that the differential treatment of political parties will always constitute
    a violation of s. 3. Nor does it stand for the proposition that an infringement
    of s. 3 arising from the differential treatment of political parties could
    never be justified. Consequently, although the disposition of this case will
    have an impact on sections of the <i>Elections Act </i>that provide… the
    right to partial reimbursement of election expenses upon receiving a certain
    percentage of the vote, I express no opinion as to the constitutionality
    of the legislation that restricts access to those benefits. It is possible
    that it would be necessary to consider factors that have not been addressed
    in this appeal in order to determine the constitutionality of restricting
    those benefits. </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>In the passage cited above,<i> </i>the
    Supreme Court made it clear that its decision<i> </i>is not to be applied
    so as to automatically invalidate the provision in issue.  Yet that is what
    the applications judge did here.  He held that the principles in <i>Figueroa </i>were
    equally applicable to these sections of the Act and that he was bound to
    follow them. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the Supreme Court noted,<i> </i>it may be necessary to consider factors on
    this appeal that were not addressed in <i>Figueroa</i>. One of the factors
    not addressed in the Supreme Court’s decision, upon which the Attorney General
    relies here, is that the role of the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) could
    become politicized or more politicized. The Attorney General has satisfied
    the first element of the test.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the need to establish irreparable harm, this court explained recently
    in <i>Henco</i> <i>Industries Ltd. v. Haudenosaunee Six Nations</i> (2006),
    82 O.R. (3d) 338 at para. 91 that: “a public authority can almost always
    show irreparable harm if the stay is not granted by demonstrating that its
    actions have been taken to promote the public interest.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    substance of the Attorney General’s argument is that, given the absence of
    meaningful prerequisites for the receipt of the per-vote allowance, the CEO
    might be obliged to assess the genuineness of leaders’ declarations on behalf
    of entities that register as political parties in order to gain access to
    public monies.  Such a situation raises concerns about the possible politicization
    of the office of the CEO, concerns that could compromise the public’s confidence
    in the political neutrality, independence, and impartiality of this office
    specifically and in the electoral process generally. Affidavit evidence before
    this court relied on by the appellant is to the effect that the office of
    the CEO enjoys a high level of credibility and public trust and that a great
    risk to public confidence could occur if the CEO determined that he was obliged
    to question the legitimacy of registered parties. One of the objectives of
    the <i>Elections Act</i> has been to avoid requiring the CEO to make determinations
    of any kind that could be regarded as political. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondents’ position is that recent amendments to the <i>Canada Elections
    Act</i> in the <i>Federal Accountability Act</i>, S.C. 2006, c. 9 call the
    appellant’s submissions about a potential loss of confidence in the CEO into
    question.  These amendments, which have received Royal Assent and come into
    force on June 12, 2007, transfer the power to appoint and dismiss returning
    officers from the Governor in Council to the Chief Electoral Officer. See <i>Federal
    Accountability Act</i>, section 174. A returning officer is responsible for
    administering the electoral process in the electoral district for which he
    or she is appointed, and ensuring that it is handled fairly and impartially.
    Concerns of partisanship <i>could</i> arise in the appointment of returning
    officers. In legislating these amendments, Parliament is implicitly conveying
    confidence that the CEO will carry out his or her duty to appoint returning

    respondents submit that if Parliament was not concerned with the prospect
    of a loss of public confidence by giving the CEO the authority to make appointments
    for this very important position, public confidence would not be lost in
    the event that the CEO feels it is his or her obligation to scrutinize the
    sincerity of a leader’s declarations on behalf of an entity that registers
    as a political party in order to gain access to public monies.</p>

    respondents’ argument that Parliament has already politicized the role of
    the <i>CEO </i>in making subsequent amendments to the <i>Act</i> does not
    entirely detract from the appellant’s argument.  If the applications judge’s
    order is not stayed, the potential for greater politicization of the role
    of the CEO and resulting risk of a loss of public confidence is a valid concern.
    The Attorney General is attempting to ensure public confidence in the administration
    of the federal electoral process and the office of the CEO and irreparable
    harm will ensue if that confidence is undermined. Its actions are being taken
    to promote the public interest. The second element of the test is met. </p>

    final consideration is the balance of convenience.  The prospect of irreparable
    harm to the respondents must be weighed against the prospect of the possible
    harm that the Attorney General has established. Both parties acknowledge
    that the minority status of the current Federal Government raises the real
    possibility that an election could be called before the hearing of this appeal
    and decision of this court. Political parties and candidates require funds
    to participate in the electoral process and to communicate information about
    their platforms. I accept the respondents’ submission that, if a stay is
    granted, they will suffer harm in their ability to contest an election without
    the funding that is owed to them. If there is a correlation between voter
    support and effective communication, parties entitled to these funds could
    be disadvantaged and might not win as much support as they otherwise could. </p>

'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accepting
    that there is a correlation between funding and votes, I am of the opinion
    that the harm the respondents will suffer is not irreparable. There is no
    evidence before me that the respondents cannot borrow the money in issue
    until the outcome of this appeal is determined.  In the event that they borrow
    the money, they will not suffer irreparable harm but only financing costs.
    At this time, the retroactive payment that the respondents concede is automatically
    stayed is the greater amount in issue, not the prospective payments. No application
    to lift that stay has been made. </p>

    also note that in <i>Figueroa, supra,</i> in the face of a pending federal
    election, the Supreme Court suspended the unconstitutionality of its declaration
    for 12 months in order to give Parliament an opportunity to respond.  In
    effect, the Supreme Court granted a stay of its decision.  Here, if a stay
    is not granted, Parliament will have no opportunity to choose its own response
    to this declaration prior to its prospective implementation. The question
    on appeal of whether the declaration should be suspended will be effectively
    rendered moot. </p>

    of justice to maintain the <i>status quo</i> pending the hearing of the appeal
    and to grant the stay requested. </p>
