  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the order of
      Justice Cumming of the Superior Court of Justice dated June 12, 2006.</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant made an assignment in bankruptcy in 1994 and was discharged in
    1996.  The appellant’s trustee in bankruptcy, the respondent, was discharged
    in 1997.  As a result of recent litigation, the trustee learned that the
    appellant may have failed to disclose that he held a valuable interest in
    real property at the date of bankruptcy. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    bankruptcy judge accepted the trustee’s submission that the bankrupt owned
    an interest in the property at the date of bankruptcy and that this interest
    had not been disclosed.  As a result, the bankruptcy judge granted the trustee’s
    motion and made an order under s. 41(11) of the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency
    Act</i> reappointing the respondent as trustee in bankruptcy of the appellant
    for the purpose of completing the administration of the estate of the bankrupt.  The
    order also provided that the reappointment of the trustee was without prejudice
    to any claim that may be brought pursuant to s. 81(1) of the <i>Bankruptcy
    and Insolvency Act</i> by the appellant’s spouse, Rachelle Chetty, 675590
    Ontario Limited or by anyone else claiming an interest in the property. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal to this court, the appellant maintains that the bankruptcy judge’s
    order is based on a finding that the appellant failed to disclose his interest
    in a valuable asset and amounts to a finding of fraud, and that such a finding
    ought not to have been made in a summary proceeding where, as here, there
    was conflicting evidence.  The appellant maintains that the interest in the
    property is not his but rather that of his wife.  His wife is not a party
    to this proceeding and the bankruptcy judge’s finding is prejudicial to her
    interest. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trustee takes the position that the material clearly established a <i>prima
    facie</i> case that the bankrupt owned an interest in the property.  The
    finding of the bankruptcy judge was therefore fully supported by the evidence
    and ought not to be interfered with.  The appellant’s spouse is not prejudiced
    since the order specifically provides that it was made without prejudice
    to her rights, the rights of 675590 Ontario Limited in which she has a 50%
    interest, and the rights of others that may claim an interest in the property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the bankruptcy judge ought to have ordered the trial of an issue
    pursuant to s. 187(8) of the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i>.  The allegation
    of the trustee was, in effect, that the appellant had hidden and failed to
    disclose his interest in the property from bankruptcy.  This was disputed
    by the appellant and affidavit and documentary evidence in support of both
    positions was filed.  In light of the issues of credibility raised squarely
    by the parties and the significance of the issue, it ought not to have been
    decided in a summary proceeding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    the appellant’s spouse was not a party to the proceeding.  Although the order
    was made without prejudice to her rights and the rights of others wishing
    to challenge the appellant’s ownership of an interest in the property, the
    decision nonetheless finds under s. 41(11) that the court was “satisfied” that
    the appellant owned the property and, for practical purposes, the onus is
    then on those seeking to challenge his ownership to prove otherwise.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    proceeding by way of the trial of an issue, those claiming an interest will
    be made parties and all of the relevant evidence will be put before the court
    in one proceeding.  Findings of credibility, where required, can be made
    on <i>vive voce</i> testimony.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    conclusion, we allow the appeal, set aside the decision of the bankruptcy
    court and order the trial of an issue.  The parties may speak to a judge
    sitting on the Commercial List for directions on how the trial of the issue
    is to proceed.
     Costs reserved to the judge hearing the trial of the issue.</p>
