    appellants appeal from an order of Jenkins J. requiring that they remove
    their satellite dishes from their patio terrace. The appellants’ patio terrace
    is an exclusive use common element in London Condominium Corporation No.
    13. The Declaration of the Condominium Corporation provides as follows in
    paragraph 7.(1)(h):</p>

    addition, By-law 1 of the Condominium Corporation provides in Schedule B,
    item (l):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(l)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the Condominium Corporation enacted a rule, the relevant portions of which
    are as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The following are the standards adopted by the
    Board of Directors for satellite dish or cable installation within the Corporation. <i>These
    standards are intended to give the complex a uniform standard of appearance
    and quality that will enable all owners to benefit from well maintained units</i>. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b><u>STANDARDS</u></b></p>

    Corporation has an agreement with Star Choice for exclusive delivery of Satellite
    Services. <i>This service has one dish on each set of units. No other Satellite
    services are allowed</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>CABLE:</b></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cable

    cables running to the units will be either buried or attached to the units
    under the siding. The installer is responsible for all cable. No cable is
    to be left in such a manner as to interfere with grounds maintenance.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
    cable is to run up the outside of the siding.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>…</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants raise three main issues on appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the appellants contend that the Declaration prohibits installation of satellite
    dishes. They say that the words “except for in connection with a common television
    cable system” encompass cable television systems only and do not permit satellite
    television services. By permitting some satellite dishes (contrary to the
    terms of the Declaration) and not others, the Condominium Corporation is
    acting in a discriminatory fashion. Accordingly, the application judge should
    have exercised his discretion to decline to enforce the Declaration against
    them. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree. In our view, by enacting the rule that it did, it is clear that
    the Condominium Corporation interpreted its Declaration and By-laws as permitting
    a common television system encompassing both cable and satellite components.
    Moreover, we consider that it is for the Condominium Corporation to interpret
    its Declaration and By-laws and that so long as its interpretation is not
    unreasonable, the court should not interfere.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, in our opinion, the interpretation of the Declaration adopted
    by the Condominium Corporation is not unreasonable. While the exception to
    the prohibition in the Declaration refers to “<i>a common television</i> <i>cable
    system</i>”, we consider that those words are capable being construed in
    a generic way, and as signifying nothing more than a requirement that there
    be a common television network. Since Star Choice Satellite Services is the
    only permitted satellite service provider, the Condominium Corporation was
    not acting in a discriminatory fashion by requiring that the appellants remove
    their satellite dishes installed by a different satellite service provider.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s second argument is that satellite dishes cannot come within the
    definition of “a common television cable system”
    as set out in the Declaration because satellite dishes, by their nature,
    are stand alone units that do not provide a common service. We do not accept
    this submission. No evidence was adduced on this issue as part of the application  However,
    we note that the rule enacted by the Condominium Corporation states in part,
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Corporation has an agreement with Star Choice
    for exclusive delivery of Satellite Services. <i>This service has one dish
    on each set of units</i>. [Emphasis added.]  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>In our view, it is clear
    on the face of the rule that the permitted satellite services form part of
    a common system.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s final argument is that there was no evidence that the two satellite
    dishes installed on their patio terrace were visible to onlookers and therefore
    there was no evidence that their satellite dishes contravene the aspect of
    the rule aimed at preserving the uniform appearance of the condominium complex.
    The application judge should therefore have exercised his discretion not
    to enforce the rule as against the appellants because the rule as it related
    to them did not serve one of the two permissible purposes of a rule under
    s. 58 of the <i>Condominium Act</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree. The rule enacted by the Condominium Corporation indicates on its
    face that it was aimed at preserving a uniform appearance and quality in
    the condominium complex, which is a general purpose that appears to comply
    with s. 58 of the <i>Condominium Act</i>. To the extent that the appellants
    wished to assert that the application of the rule in their case would not
    comply with the permitted purposes of a rule under s. 58 of the <i>Condominium
    Act</i>, it was for them to adduce evidence on that issue. As the appellants
    adduced no admissible evidence on the application, we would not give effect
    to this argument.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is therefore dismissed. Costs of the appeal are fixed in the amount
    of $3,000.00 on a partial indemnity scale inclusive of disbursements and
    applicable G.S.T.</p>
