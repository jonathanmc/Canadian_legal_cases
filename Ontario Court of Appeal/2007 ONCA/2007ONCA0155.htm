  <h2>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view the motion judge erred in dismissing the within action against Robert
    Lee.  It cannot be said that there was no evidence of conduct on Mr. Lee’s
    part that could constitute oppression in relation to Mr. Mendelson within
    the meaning of s. 248 of the <i>Ontario Business Corporations Act</i>.  Lee
    read over the Share Purchase Agreement with a view to advising Norris on
    the financial aspects thereof before it was signed and he was a witness to
    it.  After the subsequent share transfer from Norris to Lee, Mendelson was
    removed as Chair allegedly as orchestrated by Lee in August of 1998.  Thereafter
    payments to Mendelson as originally agreed to continued for some time before
    they were reduced and ultimately terminated.  Soon thereafter Lee sold his
    interest in the corporation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lee
    was aware that Mendelson relied on this money for income in his later years.  He
    threatened him when the reduction was made that if Mendelson took action
    against him in court he would cash in the insurance policies on Mendelson’s
    life.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the court may find that the evidence of such conduct does not amount to oppression,
    at this stage it is not appropriate to weigh that evidence.  Its very existence
    is the reason this case should not have been dismissed at this early stage.  As
    for whether Mendelson is a  creditor within the meaning of s. 248 having
    status to bring this action and also the position here raised for the first
    time in respect of that part of his claim that relates to wages, those are
    matters to be determined in the court below if and when it becomes appropriate.  They
    are not matters for this court where the issues were not raised below and
    appear nowhere in the factums filed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was conceded before the motion judge that there was a triable issue with
    respect to the claim by Mendelson against TTI for Directors’ fees.  Mendelson’s
    oppression claim against Lee rests on his allegation that Lee was the directing
    mind of  TTI and therefore the author of the conduct that is alleged to constitute
    oppression.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons the appeal is allowed.  The summary judgment of Murray J. dismissing
    the action against Lee is set aside and the motion for summary judgment is
    dismissed.  It follows that any related costs orders are also set aside.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs
    of the appeal and of the motion below are to the appellant fixed at $10,000.00
    and $7,500.00 respectively on a partial indemnity scale inclusive of disbursements
    and applicable G.S.T.</p>
