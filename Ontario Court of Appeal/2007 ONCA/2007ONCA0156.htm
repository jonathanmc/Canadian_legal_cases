    Building Supplies (1997) Ltd. carries on business as a supplier of drywall
    and related construction materials.  It extended credit to Nicola Iori and
    Steve Gramolini who carried on a drywalling business under the name of Blue
    Willow Contracting.</p>

    Willow got paid but it did not pay Village so Village registered a lien against
    title to several lots in the subdivision. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Village
    agreed to release its liens in exchange for a mortgage of approximately $100,000
    on a home in the subdivision owed by Nicola Iori’s wife, Giuseppina Iori.  The
    property was the matrimonial home.  Title to the property was in Giuseppina
    Iori’s name alone.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    a trial, Macdonald&nbsp;J. declared the mortgage in favour of Village to
    be null and void.  She found that Ms.&nbsp;Iori’s signature on the mortgage
    had been forged and that the mortgage had been registered without Ms.&nbsp;Iori’s
    knowledge or consent.  The trial judge found that Village knew Ms.&nbsp;Iori
    was the registered owner at the time that the mortgage had been placed on
    title but that it made no inquiries to confirm that Ms.&nbsp;Iori had actually
    signed the mortgage.  She held that, as the mortgage was being placed on
    the matrimonial home, pursuant to s.&nbsp;21(1) of the <i>Family Law Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;F.3, extra precaution had to be taken to ensure that
    both spouses signed the mortgage with the benefit of independent legal advice.  Although
    she found Village to be innocent, the trial judge also found that had it
    or its advisors exercised due diligence, the fraud would probably have been
    prevented.  She held the forged mortgage to be a nullity.  She further held
    that the admitted forgery invalidated the counterclaim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Village
    argues that the trial judge failed to properly or adequately deal with its
    counterclaim.  The two principal claims made in the counterclaim and advanced
    again on appeal are that Ms.&nbsp;Iori has been unjustly enriched to the
    detriment of Village and that Ms.&nbsp;Iori is a constructive trustee of
    the property for Village’s benefit because of her knowing receipt of funds
    obtained through breaches of trust.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>UNJUST ENRICHMENT</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It
      is trite law that in order for Village to succeed in its unjust enrichment
      claim, it must prove that:</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>(1)       Ms.&nbsp;Iori was enriched;</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;

      and</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>(3)       there is no juristic reason for the enrichment.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ms.&nbsp;Iori
      is said to have been enriched as a result of an $80,000 reduction in the
      purchase price of the property.  This reduction resulted from an agreement
      made in April 2000 between the builder-developer of the subdivision and
      Blue Willow.  There is no evidence that Ms.&nbsp;Iori, although named as
      a party to the agreement, ever signed the agreement.  Under the terms of
      the April 2000 agreement, the purchase price of the property was reduced
      by $80,000 in exchange for drywalling to be supplied and installed in the
      subdivision by Blue Willow.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Even
      assuming that the first two requirements for unjust enrichment have been
      satisfied, we are of the view that the April 2000 agreement is a juristic
      reason for Ms.&nbsp;Iori to have received the $80,000 benefit.  The April
      2000 agreement made between the builder&#8209;developer and Blue Willow
      was a valid contract under the terms of which the builder&#8209;developer
      received drywall services from Blue Willow in exchange for which it reduced
      the purchase price of the matrimonial home by $80,000.  The contract is
      a juristic reason for the $80,000 reduction in the purchase price which
      inured to Ms.&nbsp;Iori’s benefit.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>CONSTRUCTIVE TRUST</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again,
    there is no quarrel between the parties on the basic principles of law: a
    stranger to a trust may be liable as a constructive trustee for breach of
    trust on the basis of knowing receipt of trust property.  Liability in this
    case depends on Village proving that two requirements have been satisfied:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.&nbsp;Iori
    received trust property; and</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>she
    had knowledge of the breach of trust.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    does not appear from the record that Ms.&nbsp;Iori had sufficient knowledge
    of the circumstances such that it would be open to a court to find that an
    honest person would have been on inquiry, as required by the <i>Citadel General
    Assurance Co. v. Lloyds Bank Canada</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 805.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    Ms.&nbsp;Iori never received trust property.  Even if Nicola&nbsp;Iori received
    monies which could be characterized under the <i>Construction Lien Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;C.30, as trust monies, there is no evidence to trace
    those monies into Ms.&nbsp;Iori’s hands or the property.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
    the appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondents fixed at $4,000, inclusive
    of GST and disbursements.</p>
