  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the conviction
      entered on March 5, 2004, and the sentence imposed on March 29, 2004, by
      Justice Casimir N. Herold of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting without
      a jury</span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>.</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is an appeal from the decision of Herold J. following a five-day trial in
    which he convicted the appellant of possession of child pornography, sexual
    interference and sexual assault.  After staying the sexual assault conviction,
    the trial judge sentenced the appellant to two years less a day, to be followed
    by three years probation, with the added five-year prohibition that the appellant
    stay away from parks and schools.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the sexual assault charge should have been stayed as
    a section 7 <i>Charter</i> violation because the destruction of the videotape
    prejudiced his ability to make full answer and defence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not agree.  In our view, the absence of the videotape did not prejudice
    the appellant because the police officer’s notes were available and outlined
    the weaknesses in the videotape.  Those weaknesses included concerns about
    the interviewer asking the child leading questions, the child changing her
    mind on whether she had been asleep or awake during the assault, and the
    child indicating twice that some of her information came from her mother.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    the complainant testified at the preliminary inquiry and at trial, the defence
    had the opportunity to test both her credibility and her reliability.  In
    his closing submissions at trial, the appellant’s counsel stressed that the
    videotape was no longer available and that the police notes demonstrated
    the unreliability of the complainant.  In addition, the trial judge specifically
    reviewed the videotape’s weaknesses in his reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are not satisfied that there was any prejudice that would warrant a stay.  Accordingly,
    we cannot find that counsel rendered ineffective assistance by not moving
    for a stay at trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also alleges ineffective assistance of counsel because his trial
    counsel failed to bring an application for production of the complainant’s
    counselling records.  In our view, there is nothing to support the “likely
    relevance”
    necessary to found a claim for production.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that his counsel failed to follow his instructions to put
    forward a defence that the pornography was planted by his former wife with
    the collaboration of her sons.  On this issue, the trial counsel clearly
    considered the potential for a defence of fabrication, retained a computer
    expert to analyse the material and, in our view, wisely concluded that the
    defence of fabrication had no chance of success.  The trial counsel documented
    his concerns about this defence in a lengthy letter to the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the appellant was present and testified at the trial.  When asked to explain
    the presence of the pornography, he offered no explanation.  It would have
    been evident to the appellant that his counsel was not putting forward this
    defence.  Therefore, we are inclined to the view that the appellant accepted
    his counsel’s advice not to put forward this defence.  In any event, given
    the lack of merit to the defence, there was no miscarriage of justice caused
    by the failure to put it forward.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellant argues that the trial judge erred in taking into consideration
    as a factor on the sexual assault charge that the pornography included images
    of young girls with the face of his step-daughter as a child transposed onto
    their bodies.  In our view, the trial judge was entitled to consider this
    evidence in arriving at his verdict.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant has served his period of incarceration.  We see no error in the
    length of probation or in the five-year prohibition order that the appellant
    stay away from parks and schools.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is dismissed.</p>
