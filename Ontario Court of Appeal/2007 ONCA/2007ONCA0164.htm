style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Rattray was stopped by a police officer while he was driving a motor vehicle.  The
    police officer told him that the licence plates on the car he was driving
    were stolen dealer plates.  Mr. Rattray was charged with possession of the
    stolen plates.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    Mr. Rattray arrived for the trial on the charge relating to the stolen dealer
    plates, he brought with him a letter which purported to explain that the
    dealer plates had been given to him in error.  Although the letter was unsigned,
    it was on
    “Toronto Auctions” letterhead and showed that it had been prepared by “Ingrid
    Steenkamp, dealer services representative”.  One of Ms.&nbsp;Steenkamp’s
    business cards was stapled to the letter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on the letter, Mr. Rattray was charged with obstructing the course of justice
    in a judicial proceeding, contrary to s.&nbsp;139(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    and with knowingly using a forged document, contrary to s.&nbsp;368(1) of
    the <i>Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.&nbsp;Steenkamp
    testified at Mr. Rattray’s trial on these charges.  She testified that she
    never wrote the letter and would not have had any reason to write it, given
    her employment responsibilities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.  Rattray

    trial judge gave numerous examples of inconsistencies and inaccuracies in
    Mr. Rattray’s version of events and then rejected it.    </p>

'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Rattray appeals from conviction on the basis that the trial judge erred by
    imposing on him an improper burden of proof.  Rather than applying the reasonable
    doubt standard, it is argued that the trial judge asked whether Mr. Rattray’s
    evidence “could reasonably be true”.  The error is said to be evident in
    the following passage from the reasons for conviction:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Therefore, what do we have before us?  <b>We have
      the evidence of Mr.&nbsp;Rattray, which not only did I not accept,</b> <b>but</b> based
      on the comments I have made, <b>cannot reasonably be true</b>.  [emphasis
      added.]</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Because
      Mr.&nbsp;Rattray testified, the trial judge was obliged to follow the three&#8209;step
      analysis outlined in <i>R. v. W. (D.)</i> (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.):</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>First, if you believe the evidence of the accused,
    obviously you must acquit.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Secondly, if you do not believe the testimony of
    the accused but you are left in reasonable doubt by it, you must acquit.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Thirdly, even if you are not left in doubt by the
    evidence of the accused, you must ask yourself whether, on the basis of the
    evidence which you do accept, you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt
    by that evidence of the guilt of the accused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the trial judge did not explicitly refer to <i>W.(D.)</i>, his reasons appear
    to follow the prescribed analysis.  At p.&nbsp;9 of the reasons, the trial
    judge wrote:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>At the end of the day, Mr.&nbsp;Rattray is spinning
    a web that unfortunately is so full of holes that there is no reasonable
    inference that the Court can make on his evidence, save and except for the
    one reasonable inference the Court can make, which is that it is unreasonable
    to accept any of the comments that he made based on the analysis I have made.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    conforms with the first step of the <i>W. (D.)</i> analysis: the trial judge
    did not believe Mr.&nbsp;Rattray’s evidence and, therefore, did not acquit
    on that basis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge should then have moved to the second step of <i>W. (D.)</i>,
    which would have required a determination of whether Mr.&nbsp;Rattray’s evidence,
    although disbelieved, raised a reasonable doubt.  Instead, he made the impugned
    comments, set out above.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then undertook the third step of the <i>W. (D.) </i>analysis,
    albeit not expressly.  He found Ms.&nbsp;Steenkamp’s evidence believable,
    and held that all elements of the offences had been proven beyond a reasonable
    doubt.  He stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…[L]ooking at the evidence globally, I come to
    the following conclusion, which is that the only reasonable inference open
    to me, is that in fact Ms.&nbsp;Steenkamp never wrote that letter.  This
    letter is in fact a forgery and …
    Mr.&nbsp;Rattray presented it in the hopes that it would be considered to
    be a genuine document.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court has repeatedly held that the “might reasonably be true” test should
    be avoided when dealing with contradictory evidence in cases where the presumption
    of innocence, and none other, applies.  Use of the “might reasonably be true” test
    amounts to imposing an affirmative obligation on the defence to either introduce
    evidence disproving guilt, or risk conviction, and undermines the presumption
    of innocence.  The proper approach, in accordance with the second step of <i>W.(D.)</i>,
    is for the trier of fact to determine whether the accused’s evidence raises
    a reasonable doubt, and acquit if it does.  See, for example, <i>R. v. Phillips</i> (2001),
    154 C.C.C. (3d) 345 at paras. 35&#8209;36; <i>R. v. G.H.</i>, [2002] O.J.
    No. 3635 at paras. 14-15; and, <i>R. v. Phung</i>, [2007] O.J. No. 352 at
    paras. 4-6.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    problem with the “might reasonably be true” test was explained by Fish J.A.
    (as he then was) in <i>R. v. Mathieu</i> (1994), 90 C.C.C. (3d) 415 (Que.
    C.A.):  inquiring whether the accused’s evidence might reasonably be true
    reverses the onus of proof, and therefore does not accomplish the objective
    of the <i>W.(D.)</i> analysis.  The “might reasonably be true”
    test emerges from the doctrine of recent possession which is based on the
    principle that “the accused risks conviction for certain theft&#8209;related
    offences unless he or she furnishes a plausible explanation”.  In theft cases,
    the absence of an explanation that might reasonably be true will usually
    lead the trier of fact to conclude that the fact of possession proves beyond
    a reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But,
    applying the “might reasonably be true” test to cases in which the trier
    of fact is faced with contradictory evidence would risk undermining the presumption
    of innocence.  The accused is obliged neither to testify nor to disprove
    his or her guilt.  Rather, the Crown bears the onus of establishing guilt
    beyond a reasonable doubt.  There is an unacceptably high risk that the trier
    of fact, if permitted to ask whether the accused’s evidence might reasonably
    be true, will be drawn into choosing between conflicting versions of events.  This
    would effectively impose an affirmative onus on the accused to disprove his
    or her guilt, which is obviously an error of law.  Because of this danger,
    the “might reasonably be true” test should not be imported into the context
    of resolving credibility contests.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the impugned language reveals that the trial judge erred at the
    second stage of the <i>W.(D.) </i>analysis.  He was obliged to decide whether
    Mr.&nbsp;Rattray’s evidence raised a reasonable doubt.  Mr.&nbsp;Rattray
    was not obligated to provide an explanation that could reasonably be true.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However,
      it is clear that the trial judge completely rejected the appellant’s testimony
      and found the Crown’s case overwhelming.  Accordingly, I am not persuaded
      that the error constitutes reversible error.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This
      court has upheld convictions in prior cases where the trial judge inquired
      at the second stage of the <i>W.(D.)</i> analysis whether the accused’s
      evidence
    “might reasonably be true”.  In <i>Phillips</i>, Moldaver&nbsp;J.A. stated
    that although it would have been preferable for the trial judge to have instructed
    the jury in accordance with <i>W.(D.)</i>, the failure to do so did not constitute
    reversible error.  He found that the trial judge’s instruction would have
    left the jury with the understanding that they “need not accept [the witness’]
    evidence as truthful before acting on it to find a reasonable doubt”.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Similarly,
      in <i>G.H.</i>, this court found that the trial judge misstated the second
      branch of <i>W. (D.)</i> by asking whether the accused’s evidence could
      reasonably be true.  However, it upheld the accused’s conviction, saying
      at para. 15, that “in the circumstances of this case, it is clear that
      the trial judge completely rejected the appellant’s testimony and found
      the Crown case overwhelming”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although
      this court’s most recent decision on point quashed the accused’s conviction,
      the trial judge’s reasons in that case revealed a much more fundamental
      error than in the present case.  In <i>Phung</i>, the trial judge found
      the accused had failed to establish “on the balance of probabilities”
    that his evidence might reasonably be true.  This court held that the trial
    judge had imposed an affirmative evidentiary burden on the accused to prove
    his innocence by furnishing an explanation that met the balance of probabilities
    standard of proof.  As such, the trial judge had misapprehended, rather than
    misstated, the law. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      my view, the trial judge’s error in the present case is akin to that in <i>G.H.</i>  It
      is apparent that the trial judge unequivocally rejected Mr.&nbsp;Rattray’s
      testimony and, in fact, found it nonsensical.  When read as a whole, the
      reasons for judgment indicate that the trial judge applied the proper standard
      of proof and was left with no doubt as to Mr.&nbsp;Rattray’s guilt.    </span></p>
