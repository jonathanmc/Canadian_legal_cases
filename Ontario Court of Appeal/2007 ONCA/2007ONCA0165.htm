      factor tells strongly in favour of the respondent.  The reality – and,
      in my view, this is the crucial point in this application – is that the
      gathering order stage of the hearing process is a preliminary one.  The
      pivotal point, where important issues are raised and serious interests
      are at stake, is the sending stage which, in this case, is scheduled to
      proceed later this week.  All that the application judge did last week
      was preserve the relevant material, make it accessible to the parties,
      and lay the groundwork for a full and effective sending stage of the hearing.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(c)       <u>Merits of grounds

      do not say that the proposed grounds of appeal are frivolous.  However,
      I would label two of the grounds (the conflation and legal test grounds)
      as very weak and the third (the excision issue) as peripheral to the main
      issue before the application judge.  Accordingly, this factor favours the
      respondent.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This
      factor strongly favours the respondent.  The gathering order prejudices
      no one.  As set out above, the import and effect of the gathering order
      is the preservation of relevant material, ensuring its accessibility to
      both parties, and promoting a full, fair and effective sending stage of
      the hearing.  As expressed by Ms.&nbsp;Alyea, the sending hearing is “the
      meat and potatoes” of the process; the gathering stage is preliminary.</span></p>
