    June 26,&nbsp;1997 the appellant, Louise Reynolds, was charged with the second
    degree murder of her seven year old daughter Sharon.  It would be almost
    two years until she was released on bail pending her trial.  Pursuant to
    a warrant under the <i>Coroners Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;C.37, the respondent,
    Dr. Charles Smith, a pediatric pathologist, had earlier conducted a <i>post</i> <i>mortem</i> examination
    on the body of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sharon to determine the cause of her death.  In his view, her death was caused
    by the loss of blood resulting from multiple stab wounds.  Contrary to s.
    28(2) of the Act, following the autopsy, Dr.&nbsp;Smith gave an oral opinion
    of the cause of death to the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Kingston police.  It was not until March&nbsp;8,&nbsp;1998 that Dr.&nbsp;Smith
    complied with s.&nbsp;28(2) by providing a written <i>post mortem</i> report
    to the coroner who had issued the warrant directing him to perform the autopsy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was on the basis of Dr.&nbsp;Smith’s opinion of the cause of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Sharon’s death that Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds was charged with
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sharon’s murder.  There was a pit bull terrier located in the basement of
    Ms. Reynolds’ home where
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Sharon’s body was found.  The
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Kingston police failed to tell Dr.&nbsp;Smith about this before he performed
    the autopsy, although he subsequently became aware of this fact during the
    police investigation.  However, he continued to assert that the cause of
    death was multiple stab wounds.  In testifying on April 27 and 29, 1998 at
    Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds’ preliminary hearing, Dr.&nbsp;Smith testified that
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sharon’s death was caused by loss of blood resulting from more than eighty
    stab wounds to her body made by a knife or a pair of scissors.  He also testified
    that it was his opinion that
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Sharon’s wounds were not caused by dog bites.  Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds was consequently
    committed to trial on the charge of second degree murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the preliminary hearing, on the recommendation of the Deputy Chief Coroner
    for
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario and the Chief Forensic Pathologist for
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, crown counsel obtained an order for the exhumation of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Sharon’s body.  A second <i>post mortem</i> examination of her body was performed
    by Dr.&nbsp;Smith and by other pathologists.  The result of this autopsy
    was that a dog was responsible for at least some of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sharon’s injuries.</p>

'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on the result of the second autopsy, on January 25, 2001, the Crown withdrew
    the second degree murder charge against Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds.  She had been
    in custody for exactly twenty&#8209;two months from the date of her arrest
    until April&nbsp;26,&nbsp;1999, when she was granted judicial interim release
    on very stringent terms.  During this period, her other children were removed
    from her care by the authorities.</p>

'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly
    after the Crown withdrew the murder charge, Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds commenced this
    proceeding against the City of
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Kingston Police Services Board, six members of the Kingston Police Force,
    Dr.&nbsp;Smith and Dr.&nbsp;Wood.  Dr. Wood is a forensic odontologist, retained
    by the Crown, who, in his report of February&nbsp;22,&nbsp;1998, opined that
    the markings seen on
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sharon’s body were not dog bite marks.  In a twenty&#8209;four page statement
    of claim, Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds described her claims against all of the defendants
    with exceptional particularity.  Her claims against the police defendants
    alleged that they negligently investigated her daughter Sharon’s death, leading
    to her false arrest and false imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    central focus of Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds’ claim against Dr.&nbsp;Smith is also
    based on negligent investigation.  She alleges that he performed the initial
    autopsy negligently, recklessly and in bad faith, with the view to securing
    a conviction.  In addition, she relies on the emerging tort of misfeasance
    in a public office, alleging deliberate unlawful conduct on the part of Dr.&nbsp;Smith
    in the exercise of his public functions under the <i>Coroners Act</i>.  It
    is evident from the statement of claim that Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds’ claim against
    Dr.&nbsp;Smith is based on what he did or failed to do, and not in respect
    to his testimony at her preliminary hearing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying
    on the witness immunity rule, Dr.&nbsp;Smith moved pursuant to rule&nbsp;21.01(1)(b)
    of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> to strike out Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds’ statement
    of claim on the ground that “it discloses no reasonable cause of action”.  In
    dismissing the respondent’s motion, Coo&nbsp;J. concluded “that it is not
    plain and obvious that the plaintiff’s claim is doomed to failure as it has
    been cast in this action”.  Before Coo&nbsp;J., the appellant’s statement
    of claim did not include a claim based on the tort of misfeasance in a public
    office.  Master&nbsp;Egan subsequently granted the appellant leave to amend
    her statement of claim to add a claim based on this tort.</p>

'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.&nbsp;Smith

    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court from the orders of Coo&nbsp;J. and Master&nbsp;Egan.  In
    reasons reported at (2006), 267 D.L.R. (4th) 409, a majority of the Divisional
    Court allowed both appeals.  On behalf of the majority, O’Driscoll&nbsp;J.
    dismissed Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds’ action against Dr.&nbsp;Smith.  In dissent,
    Wilson&nbsp;J. would have dismissed both appeals and permitted Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds’ action
    to proceed to trial.  Having been granted leave to appeal, Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds
    appeals from the result reached by the majority of the

    considering the reasons of O’Driscoll&nbsp;J. and Wilson&nbsp;J., it will
    be helpful to make a brief reference to the test that applies on a rule&nbsp;21.01(1)(b)
    motion and to the witness immunity rule.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Hunt
      v. Carey Canada Inc.</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959, is the leading case on when
      a statement of claim, or portions of it, may be struck out on the ground
      that it fails to disclose a reasonable cause of action.  As such, it deals
      with the substantive adequacy of a claim.  On behalf of the Supreme Court,
      at p.&nbsp;980 Wilson&nbsp;J. articulated the following test:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>Thus, the test
      in Canada governing the application of provisions like Rule 19(24)(a) of
      the British Columbia</span><i><span style='font-family:&quot;Book Antiqua&quot;;letter-spacing:
-.15pt'> Rules of Court</span></i><span style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'> is the
      same as the one that governs an application under R.S.C.&nbsp;O. 18, r.&nbsp;19:
      assuming that the facts as stated in the statement of claim can be proved,
      is it “plain and obvious” that the plaintiff’s statement of claim discloses
      no reasonable cause of action?&nbsp; As in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">England</st1:country-region>
    , if there is a chance that the plaintiff might succeed, then the plaintiff
    should not be “driven from the judgment seat”.&nbsp; Neither the length and
    complexity of the issues, the novelty of the cause of action, nor the potential
    for the defendant to present a strong defence should prevent the plaintiff
    from proceeding with his or her case.&nbsp; Only if the action is certain
    to fail because it contains a radical defect ranking with the others listed
    in Rule 19(24) of the British Columbia</span><i><span
style='font-family:"Book Antiqua";letter-spacing:-.15pt'> Rules of Court</span></i><span
style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'> should the relevant portions of a plaintiff’s
    statement of claim be struck out under Rule 19(24)(a).<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Earlier,
    at p.&nbsp;972, Wilson&nbsp;J. observed:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…<span style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>Thus, the
      fact that the plaintiff’s case was a complicated one could not justify
      striking out the statement of claim.&nbsp; Complex matters that disclosed
      substantive questions of law were most appropriately addressed at trial
      where evidence concerning the facts could be led and where arguments about
      the merits of a plaintiff’s case could be made.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>The requirement
      that it be “plain and obvious” that some or all of the statement of claim
      discloses no reasonable cause of action before it can be struck out, as
      well as the proposition that it is singularly inappropriate to use the
      rule’s summary procedure to prevent a party from proceeding to trial on
      the grounds that the action raises difficult questions, has been affirmed
      repeatedly in the last century.  [Citations omitted.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Wilson&nbsp;J.
    concluded as follows at pp.&nbsp;990&#8209;991:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>The fact that
      a pleading reveals “an arguable, difficult or important point of law” cannot
      justify striking out part of the statement of claim.&nbsp; Indeed, I would
      go so far as to suggest that where a statement of claim reveals a difficult
      and important point of law, it may well be critical that the action be
      allowed to proceed.&nbsp; Only in this way can we be sure that the common
      law in general, and the law of torts in particular, will continue to evolve
      to meet the legal challenges that arise in our modern industrial society.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The “plain
    and obvious” test has been followed consistently in Ontario in cases such
    as <i>R.D.&nbsp;Belanger &amp; Associates Ltd. v. Stadium Corp. of Ontario
    Ltd.</i> (1991), 5&nbsp;O.R. (3d) 778 (C.A.); <i>Spasic Estate v. Imperial
    Tobaced Ltd.</i> (2000), 49 O.R. (3d) 699 (C.A.); leave to appeal to S.C.C.

    267 D.L.R. (4th) 37 (Ont. C.A.); leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused 267 D.L.R.
    (4th) ix.  These cases stand for the proposition that at the interlocutory
    stage of proceedings the court should not dispose of matters of law that
    are not fully settled in the jurisprudence.  Such issues should be decided
    at trial on the basis of a full evidentiary record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    absolute immunity of parties and witnesses from subsequent liability for
    their testimony in judicial proceedings developed in early English cases
    and is well established at common law.  Any communication, even perjured
    testimony, made in the course of a judicial proceeding, cannot serve as the
    basis for a suit in tort.  The rationale for witness immunity, which has
    become less an evidentiary rule than a rule of substantive law, is that the
    proper administration of justice requires full and free disclosure from witnesses
    unhampered by fear of retaliatory lawsuits.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Samuel
    Manu&#8209;Tech Inc. v. Redipac Recycling Corp.</i> (1999), 38 C.P.C. (4th)

    on the ground that he erred in failing to apply the witness immunity rule

    that as he had testified at her preliminary hearing, absolute privilege provided
    him with immunity from liability for all stages of his involvement in the
    police investigation of the death of the appellant’s daughter, beginning
    with the autopsy that he performed on her body at the direction of the coroner.  Dr.&nbsp;Smith
    repeated this argument before this court.  He also appealed on the same ground

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, on the facts admitted for the purpose

    Sharon to ascertain the cause of her death. The <i>Coroners Act</i> also
    required Dr. Smith to prepare a written post-mortem report. Dr. Smith was
    required by the provisions of the <a name=reflex-statute-12027145><i>Criminal
    Code</i></a> of

    to obey the subpoena, attend at Ms. Reynolds’ preliminary inquiry and, under
    oath or solemn affirmation, answer the questions asked of him. Dr. Smith
    did all the things required of him by law. His opinion as to the cause of
    death never changed. There can be no question that Dr. Smith has witness
    immunity for <i>his oral testimony</i>….</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>On this record, I come to the same conclusion as
    reached in <i>Elliott (supra)</i> – the witness immunity rule applies to
    the negligence claim against the defendant – here Dr. Smith – a witness who
    testified in an earlier proceeding and who is now being sued on that earlier
    testimony and/or a post mortem report that he was required by law to prepare.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Having reached that conclusion, in my view, it
    is “plain and obvious” that the Plaintiff cannot succeed on the negligence
    claim against Dr. Smith. See: <i>Hunt v. Carey Canada Inc.</i>, <a
name=reflex-caselaw-28655171>1990 (S.C.C.)</a>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959, 976.   [Emphasis

    dismissed Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds’ claim in negligence, in paras. 33 and 34, without
    any analysis, O’Driscoll&nbsp;J. also dismissed her claim for misfeasance
    in a public office:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As quoted earlier, in <i>Samuel Manu-Tech (supra)</i> at
    para. 20 it is stated that the doctrine of witness immunity “extends to any
    action, however framed and is not limited to actions of defamation”. See

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Therefore, the Plaintiff’s action based on the

    her dissenting reasons, Wilson&nbsp;J. explained that Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds was
    not suing Dr.&nbsp;Smith with respect to the testimony he gave at Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds’ preliminary
    hearing.  Wilson&nbsp;J. interpreted the allegations against Dr.&nbsp;Smith
    in the statement of claim as having negligently performed the initial autopsy
    in bad faith, with a view to securing a conviction, and having engaged in
    misfeasance in a public office.  At para.&nbsp;53, she stated:</p>

    conducts an autopsy pursuant to the <i>Coroners Act </i>and subsequently
    testifies in criminal proceedings.&nbsp; Furthermore, both the law relating
    to the doctrine of witness immunity and the law relating to the tort of public
    misfeasance are uncertain and constantly evolving, driven by the particular
    facts of individual cases.&nbsp; Counsel for Dr. Smith have not cited any
    binding authority on this court in support of their position.&nbsp; The decision

  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>As it emanated from the dismissal

    engaged in a lengthy review of English and Canadian authorities that have
    considered the application of the witness immunity rule in a variety of factual
    situations.  In para.&nbsp;112, she concluded that the authorities demonstrate
    that the law with respect to the scope of witness immunity is not settled
    in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario, and that the courts have decided that this issue cannot be resolved
    at the pleading stage.  It can only be determined at trial on the basis of
    a complete factual record.  This is because whether witness immunity applies
    is primarily a question of fact.  Moreover, the party claiming immunity has
    the burden to prove facts that bring him or her within it.  She went on to
    refer to <i>R.D. Belanger</i>, <i>supra</i>, and other decisions of this
    court which emphasize that matters of law that have not been fully settled
    should not be disposed of at the pleading stage of the proceedings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice&nbsp;Wilson’s
    reasons for dismissing the appeal are to be found at paras.&nbsp;130 to&nbsp;132:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The law with respect to witness immunity and absolute
    privilege has evolved and continues to evolve. The courts have not examined
    the provisions of the <i>Coroners Act </i>that define the duties and limit
    the privilege afforded to someone like Dr. Smith.&nbsp; The determination
    of the boundaries of witness immunity, and the distinction between investigation
    and testimony in this specific context, involve nuanced questions of fact.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The determination of unsettled legal issues should
    be made only in the context of a full factual record, possibly including
    appropriate expert evidence: see <i>Spasic Estate v. Imperial Tobacco Ltd.</i> (2000),
    49 O.R. (3d) 699, 188 D.L.R. (4th) 577 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at paras. 22-23.&nbsp; To the extent that this case involves the resolution
    of unsettled questions of law, requiring a factual context, a Rule 21 motion
    is not the proper forum to resolve the issue.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>For all these reasons, I am not satisfied that
    the defendant Dr. Smith has proved that it is “plain and obvious” in law
    that witness immunity applies to all acts and reports provided by Dr. Smith
    related to the autopsy. I would therefore dismiss the appeal from the decision
    of Justice Coo.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, Wilson&nbsp;J. would have dismissed Dr.&nbsp;Smith’s appeal from
    Master&nbsp;Egan’s order granting Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds leave to amend her statement
    of claim to add a claim based on the tort of misfeasance in a public office.  The
    added claim raised the issue whether a medical practioner who performs an
    autopsy at the request of a coroner is a public officer, or acts as an agent
    of the coroner.  Justice&nbsp;Wilson stated that this issue has not been
    determined by any court in this province.  In para.&nbsp;145, Wilson&nbsp;J.
    expressed her agreement with the conclusion of Master&nbsp;Egan that “it
    is not beyond all doubt that the claim that Dr.&nbsp;Smith is a public officer
    is impossible of success”.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    only issue on this appeal is whether, in striking out Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds’ claims
    against Dr.&nbsp;Smith, the majority of the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court erred in law by failing to properly apply the “plain and
    obvious” test.  In my view, it did.  The essence of Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds’ claims
    against Dr.&nbsp;Smith is in respect to his role as a public official investigating
    a suspicious death under the <i>Coroners Act</i>, and not to his role in
    testifying in her criminal prosecution.  As Wilson&nbsp;J. has pointed out,
    this is a classic example of the type of case that should be allowed to proceed
    to trial to enable the court to make a decision on Dr.&nbsp;Smith’s witness
    immunity claim, which he has the burden of establishing, on the basis of
    a complete factual record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, it is important to keep in mind that the court is dealing with a
    pleading motion brought by Dr.&nbsp;Smith who contends that it is plain and
    obvious that the respondent’s statement of claim fails to disclose a reasonable
    cause of action.  As such, this issue is to be determined on the basis of
    the pleadings that, for the motion, are taken to be accurate and capable
    of proof.  Following this analysis, I have no doubt that the statement of
    claim discloses a reasonable cause of action constituting the torts of negligence
    and misfeasance in a public office.  There is no radical defect in the pleading
    of the elements of either tort.  Dr.&nbsp;Smith contends that the claims
    cannot succeed because he is the beneficiary of the witness immunity rule.  In
    my view, this is different from contending that a statement of claim is not
    substantively adequate.  Probably it would have been more appropriate had
    the appellant’s claims been attacked on a Rule&nbsp;20 motion for summary
    judgment.  However, in my view the result of such motion would have been
    the same as it would have been clear that there was a genuine issue for trial
    in respect to the application of the witness immunity rule as this would
    be for the trial judge to determine on the basis of a complete factual record.</p>

'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have mentioned, the majority of the Divisional Court, without any analysis,
    allowed the appeal from Master&nbsp;Egan’s order granting leave to the appellant
    to amend her statement of claim to plead the tort of misfeasance in a public
    office on the ground that “the allegation of misfeasance in public office
    cannot succeed because the <i>Hunt v. Carey</i> test has once again been
    met”.  In <i>Freeman&#8209;Maloy</i>, <i>supra</i>, applying <i>Odhavji Estate
    v. Woodhouse</i>, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 263, at para. 26 Sharpe&nbsp;J.A. stated
    that “[a]lthough the tort of misfeasance in a public office has deep roots
    in the history of the common law, it is constantly evolving”.  Given the
    permissive right to amend pleadings in rule&nbsp;26.01, in my view the majority
    of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court erred in reversing Master Egan’s order.  As well, there
    did not appear to be any evidence that Dr.&nbsp;Smith would be prejudiced
    by the amendment.  That is not to say that the claim will succeed, only that
    it should be allowed to proceed to trial to be fully considered on the basis
    of a proper factual record and in the light of the other claims asserted
    by Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds.  As Sharpe&nbsp;J.A. pointed out in para.&nbsp;27 of <i>Freeman&#8209;Maloy</i>: “This
    will allow the appellant to air all aspects of his complaint and develop
    a full record to afford the court the opportunity to rationalize the appropriate
    scope and limits of this tort in relation to the other causes of action advanced
    by the appellant.”  Further, as Iacobucci&nbsp;J. stated in para.&nbsp;42
    of <i>Odhavji</i>: “If the facts are taken as pleaded, it is not plain and
    obvious that the actions for misfeasance in a public office…must fail.”</p>
