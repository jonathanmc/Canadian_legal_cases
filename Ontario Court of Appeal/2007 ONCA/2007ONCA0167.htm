style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    his conviction for obstructing a police officer, the appellant submits that
    the trial judge erred in two ways: first, he erred in his analysis of the <i>mens
    rea</i> requirement of the offence; second, he misapprehended the evidence
    about whether the lead BMW was a stolen car.  We disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    passages in the trial judge’s reasons show that he applied the proper <i>mens
    rea</i> analysis and that he found that the Crown had proved the appellant
    had the necessary <i>mens rea</i>.  In his reasons, the trial judge said: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The defence
    subsequently submitted that there was no evidence that the defendant had
    any knowledge that the suspect vehicle was allegedly stolen, and the defendant
    therefore had no motive to help the driver of that vehicle.  I entirely agree
    that no such knowledge can be imputed to the defendant.  However, I have
    concluded that the defendant was helping the suspect.  The defendant could
    have had any number of reasons, such as believing that the suspect was prohibited
    from driving, but it is not appropriate to speculate on motivation.  Also,
    the defendant’s motives are of no consequence.  The important point is that
    the defendant deliberately impeded Officer Jackson and thereby assisted the
    suspect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge reiterated this finding later in his reasons: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I have found
    that the defendant wilfully placed his vehicle in front of a uniformed police
    officer in a marked police vehicle and blocked the officer from following
    a suspect with a view to arresting him.  I am satisfied that the “knowledge” component
    was made out by the evidence and that <i>mens rea</i> was proven.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>On the
    basis of these passages we are satisfied that the trial judge did not err
    in his <i>mens rea</i> analysis.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant complains that in his reasons the trial judge erroneously considered
    that the lead BMW was a stolen car and that this misapprehension of the evidence
    tainted his analysis.  The appellant was acquitted of the theft charge and
    the Crown led no evidence that the other BMW was stolen.  We do not think,
    however, that the trial judge misapprehended this evidence.  Early in his
    reasons the trial judge correctly referred to the lead BMW as “a suspected
    stolen vehicle”.  The trial judge’s later references to the “stolen car” were
    undoubtedly a short hand reference to a car the police thought had been stolen.  Thus,
    we do not think that the trial judge made any error in his appreciation of
    the evidence.  Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal from the conviction for
    obstructing a police officer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    his conviction for possession of a prohibited weapon, the appellant argues
    that the trial judge erred in finding that the buck knife opened by centrifugal
    force.  We disagree.  The trial judge was entitled to rely on the officer’s
    demonstration: see <i>R. v. Phillips </i>(1978), 44 C.C.C. (2d) 548 (Ont.
    C.A.).  Accordingly, the appeal from this conviction must also fail.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is therefore dismissed. </p>
