      entered on January 9, 2006, by Justice Barry G. A. MacDougall of the Superior
      Court of Justice, sitting with a jury.</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>GILLESE J.A.:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was driving a car when it went off the road.  The passenger in
    his car, Linda Smith, was killed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was convicted of driving “over 80”, dangerous driving causing death,
    and impaired driving causing death.  He was sentenced to two years imprisonment
    and three years probation in relation to the counts of impaired driving causing
    death and dangerous driving causing death.  The count of driving with excess
    blood alcohol was stayed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals against conviction.  He argues that the convictions should
    be set aside because the trial judge:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'>(i)        erred in permitting the jury to rely upon opinions expressed by
    the Crown’s accident reconstructionist, Constable Gary Blackman, that were
    outside of his area of expertise, amounted to nothing more than his belief,
    and were without foundation in science or empirical study; and, </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'>(ii)       failed to instruct the jury that there was no evidence upon which
    it could conclude that the appellant had not engaged in bolus drinking prior
    to the accident.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>Constable Blackman’s Evidence</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Constable
    Blackman testified that the accident was caused by three factors: the appellant’s
    excessive speed, his sudden steering manoeuvre to the right at a left-hand
    bend in the road, and his impairment.  No objection was taken at trial to
    the admissibility of Constable Blackman’s opinion.  Indeed, counsel for the
    appellant at trial conceded Constable Blackman’s expertise in accident reconstruction.  The
    appellant now claims the trial judge failed to exercise his
    “gatekeeper” function by permitting Constable Blackman’s evidence regarding
    excessive speed and impairment as contributing causes of the accident to
    go to the jury.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      my view, Constable Blackman was qualified, by virtue of his training and
      experience, to give those opinions.  The weight to be accorded those opinions
      was for the jury to decide.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the issue of speed, the appellant’s complaint is essentially that because
    no mathematical calculation or scientific computation was possible, Constable
    Blackman should not have been permitted to proffer the opinion that the appellant
    was travelling in excess of the speed limit.  It is said his opinion was
    unreliable and that there was substantial potential for prejudice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    Constable Blackman did not have to be an engineer before he could proffer
    his opinion on speed.  Witnesses can obtain the necessary expertise through
    training and experience.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    principle requirement for the admission of expert evidence is that the witness
    possess special knowledge and experience going beyond that of the trier of
    fact.  Constable Blackman had extensive training and experience in accident
    reconstruction.  At the time of trial, he had attended at or reconstructed
    127 fatal collisions and 88 serious personal injury collisions involving
    motor vehicles, all-terrain vehicles and vessels; he was one of only three
    marine accident reconstructionists in the province; and he had testified
    as an expert in 20 matters before various courts and tribunals.  Any alleged
    deficiencies in Constable Blackman’s opinion went not to its admissibility
    but to its weight.  The weight to be accorded to his opinion was a matter
    for the jury. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Constable
    Blackman’s opinion on the speed of the appellant’s vehicle – which was neither
    technical nor complex – was based not only on the extensive damage to the
    appellant’s vehicle, but also on the dynamics of the accident itself.  The
    dynamics of the accident included that the vehicle had become airborne three
    times; struck one, then a second tree; rolled; and ended up at the bottom
    of a ravine.  All of this occurred over a considerable distance.  Constable
    Blackman’s opinion on speed was, in my view, well within his area of expertise.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
    the trial judge correctly charged the jury on how it was to treat expert
    evidence, including a mid-trial instruction given immediately after Constable
    Blackman’s expertise was conceded by the defence, and before he testified
    in examination-in-chief.  The trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>Because the defence has also acknowledged
      that this witness, Officer Gary Blackman, possesses the – the qualifications
      to be qualified as an expert in the area of collision re-construction,
      it also applies to him, and will also apply to any other experts that are
      qualified to testify here.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>Sometimes knowledge of a technical
      subject may help jurors decide a case.  Persons who are qualified in that
      subject by training, education or experience, may state their opinions
      about it.  They may also give reasons for their opinion.  The opinions
      of experts are just like the testimony of any other witness.  <i>Just because
      an expert has given an opinion, does not require you to accept it.  You
      may give the opinion as much or as little weight as you think it deserves.</i></span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>Here are some things to consider
      as the expert testifies: the education and experience of the expert, the
      reasons given for the opinion, the suitability of the methods used and
      other evidence in the case.  It is up to you to decide how much or little
      to rely on an expert’s opinion.  Experts usually form their opinions by
      applying their training, education and experience to a number of facts
      which the expert assumes as the basis for his or her analysis.  <i>What
      an expert assumes as a fact for the purpose of offering his or her opinion
      may be the same or different from what you later find as facts in coming
      to your decision from the evidence introduced in this case.  To the extent
      that the facts you find are different from the facts assumed by the expert
      in reach[ing] his or her conclusion, you may consider the expert’s opinion
      less reliable in helping you decide this case. </i> How much or little
      you believe of or rely upon an expert’s opinion is entirely up to you.  [Emphasis
      added]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    light of the straightforward and non-technical nature of Constable Blackman’s
    impugned opinion, his vigorous cross-examination, the trial judge’s mid-trial
    and final instructions and the closing addresses of counsel, there was no
    danger that the jury would accept Constable Blackman’s opinion that the appellant’s
    vehicle was travelling in excess of 80 km/hr as “virtually infallible”, and
    give it more weight than it deserved.  This is particularly so given defence
    counsel’s concession during his closing address that “Mr. Bulman might have
    been travelling too fast for that particular scene, but not speeding.”  The
    issue, then, was really a question of degree.  This was manifestly a question
    for the jury to resolve.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relation to impairment, I note that there was ample evidence about the appellant’s
    behaviour which the jury could find was consistent with him being impaired.  That
    evidence came from Constable Crowder, Mr. Gordon, the paramedics and Mr.&nbsp;Wigmore,
    the forensic toxicologist.  It was clear to the jury that Constable Crowder’s
    opinion of impairment was the basis for Constable Blackman’s view and that
    they had to accept Constable Crowder’s evidence on this matter before they
    could rely on Constable Blackman’s opinion that impairment was a contributing
    cause.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>Bolus Drinking</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    jury was aware that Mr. Wigmore’s expert testimony was dependent on an underlying
    assumption that had to be proven by the Crown –
    namely, that the appellant had not consumed a large quantity of alcohol shortly
    before driving (“bolus drinking”).  Whether Mr. Wigmore’s underlying assumption
    was proven was a question of fact for the jury to decide.  In making this
    finding, the jurors were entitled to rely upon their common sense, and to
    draw inferences about how normal people behave.  A reasonable inference is
    that normal people do not consume large quantities of alcohol shortly before,
    or while, driving.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, the jury had evidence that bolus drinking was “abnormal”.  Mr.
    Wigmore repeatedly referred to the bolus drinking and post-offence drinking
    scenarios as
    “abnormal”.  In the absence of any evidence suggesting that the appellant’s
    drinking pattern on this occasion was abnormal or unusual, the jury was entitled
    to conclude that the underlying assumptions of Mr. Wigmore’s opinion had
    been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition to Mr. Wigmore’s evidence concerning the rarity of bolus drinking,
    the jury was entitled to consider the inherent implausibility of the appellant
    exhibiting indicia of impairment within as little as ten to fifteen minutes
    after the accident if he had not been impaired when he was driving.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jury was fully, fairly, and properly instructed in the law.  No objection
    was taken to the charge at trial, and none is raised now.  The jury was entitled
    to find as a fact that the underlying assumptions had been proven beyond
    a reasonable doubt.  </p>
