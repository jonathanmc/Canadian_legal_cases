line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      At
    its regular public meeting on May 17, 2005, the City Council of the City
    of
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Kingston adopted a by-law changing the name of its principal public gathering
    place from “
    <st1:Street

    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Market Square” to “
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Springer Market Square”, to recognize the donation of $1 million by the Springer
    family towards the revitalization of the Square.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Prior
    to that, Council held two meetings that were closed to the public. On April
    5, 2005, Council met in closed session and approved in principle the acceptance
    of the gift and the renaming of the Square. On May 17, 2005, before its regular
    public meeting, Council met in closed session again, during which it decided
    to recommend approval of the by-law at that evening’s public meeting. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    issue in this appeal is whether the closed meetings on April 5 and May 17
    failed to comply with the requirements of the <i>Municipal Act</i>, S.O.
    2001, c. 25 (the “Act”), and if so, whether the by-law that was subsequently
    passed must be quashed for illegality.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    application judge was not persuaded that the closed meetings were illegal,
    but in any event, since the by-law was passed at a public meeting, he concluded
    that the application should be dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      While
    I do not agree that all the steps taken by the respondent in connection with
    the closed meetings were in full compliance with the Act, I agree with the
    disposition made by the application judge. For the reasons that follow, I
    would therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    facts are uncontested. Market Square has been an historic landmark in
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Kingston for more than 200 years. In March 2005, the Springer family, a wealthy
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Kingston family, indicated that they intended to donate $1 million in support
    of the project undertaken by the City to revitalize the Square, with the
    understanding that the City would rename the Square in honour of the family.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      On
    April 5, 2005, Council met and by resolution decided to go into closed session.
    The resolution to do so simply indicated that at the closed meeting Council
    would be considering “legal matters”. Once in camera, Council received a
    report from the Commissioner of Operations about the renaming, together with
    legal advice on its ability to do so and on the agreement to be entered into
    with the Springer family. Council then voted to approve in principle the
    acceptance of the Springer donation and the renaming of the Square, subject
    to an agreement being negotiated with the family to be approved by the Committee
    of the Whole and the matter being reported out for final decision by Council
    in public session.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      On
    May 17, 2005, Council again resolved to meet in closed session to consider “legal
    matters”. Once in camera, Council received a further report on the renaming
    and further legal advice from the City Solicitor including his legal opinion
    on the agreement with the Springer family. Then, sitting in camera as Committee
    of the Whole, Council voted to report out in open session the same night
    its recommendation that Council pass the by-law accepting the Springer donation
    and renaming the Square as
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Springer Market Square.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    open meeting that followed immediately was well attended by the public. Once
    the open session convened, Council voted to add the proposed by-law to its
    agenda with only one vote opposed. This more than met Council’s procedural
    requirement for a two-thirds majority to add a matter to the agenda. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Council
    then debated the issue in open session for approximately one hour. This included
    discussion of whether public consultation or public meetings were required
    prior to the vote and whether the proposed renaming was appropriate. During
    the debate, two motions to require further public consultations were put
    and defeated. In the end, Council voted 7 to 5 to adopt By-Law 2005-137,
    which accepted the Springer family donation and approved
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Springer Market Square as the official name for the Square in perpetuity. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, a resident of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Kingston, then brought an application to declare the two closed meetings
    in contravention of the Act and to quash the by-law for illegality.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge concluded that the real decision to pass the by-law was
    made at the open meeting on May 17 and then only after lengthy debate. He
    found that no final determination on the issue was made at the closed meetings
    of April 5 and May 17. He dismissed the application, concluding as follows,
    at paras. 40-41:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Although the
    matter had been discussed by Council in the April 5<sup>th</sup> and May
    17<sup>th</sup> in the[<i>sic</i>] in-camera meetings, there was no final
    determination on the issue until the matter was brought to Council and debated
    openly in the May 17<sup>th</sup> open meeting. I specifically reject the
    allegations of bad faith by the applicant in this application.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In view of my
    decision that this by-law was passed as a result of the public meeting of
    May 17, 2005, it is not necessary for me to decide on the legality of the
    April 5<sup>th</sup> and May 17<sup>th</sup> in-camera meetings. However,
    I have not been persuaded by the applicant that the April 5<sup>th</sup> and
    May 17<sup>th</sup> in-camera meetings were illegal. I find that the substantive
    matters discussed in those meetings would have properly been considered under
    section 239(2)(a) and (f) of the <i>Municipal Act</i>.</p>

      appellant first argues that the subject matter considered at the meetings
      of April 5 and May 17 fits none of the exceptions in s. 239(2), particularly
      s. 239(2)(f), the primary exception relied on by the respondent.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      do not agree. These meetings were about Council receiving and considering
      legal advice from the City Solicitor together with the surrounding circumstances
      relevant to that advice. Council obviously anticipated that this would
      all be done on a confidential basis. This advice was therefore subject
      to solicitor-client privilege. The exception relied on by the respondent
      clearly applies, and the meetings complied with s. 239(2).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Secondly,
      the appellant argues that the resolutions stating that Council will go
      into closed session to consider “legal matters” were insufficient to comply
      with s. 239(4). She argues that such a resolution falls short of stating “the
      general nature of the matter to be considered at the closed meeting.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      agree. In the circumstances of this case, I do not think that the description
    “legal matters” is sufficient. In my view, the clear legislative purpose
    informing s. 239 is to maximize the transparency of municipal governance
    so far as that as possible in the circumstances. In <i>RSJ Holdings Inc.
    v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    London (City)</i> (2005), 16 M.P.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 1 at para. 16, this
    court said the following:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>Section 239(1) of the Act requires that all meetings shall be open
      to the public unless the subject matter being considered comes within an
      exception listed in subsection (2). In light of the increased powers of
      municipalities, the mandatory wording of s. 239 that meetings “shall” be
      open to the public except in narrowly defined situations, and the specificity
      of the exceptions, it seems clear that the purpose of these provisions
      is to ensure that, in general, municipal authority is exercised openly.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      respondent argues that s. 239(4)(b) requires that the resolution do no
      more than state the exception in s. 239(2) relied on to justify closing
      the meeting to the public. However, in my view, if the legislative intent
      was to require no more than that, it would have been easy to say so in
      s. 239(4)(b). The notion of “the general nature of the matter to be considered” suggests
      more fidelity to transparent governance than that, while recognizing that
      a full description of the matter to be considered cannot be revealed to
      the public because of the very need to go into closed session. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Reading
      subsections (2) and (4)(b) together in the context of the desirability
      of open municipal government, I think that the resolution to go into closed
      session should provide a general description of the issue to be discussed
      in a way that maximizes the information available to the public while not
      undermining the reason for excluding the public. Where the exception to
      the presumptive openness of Council meetings is that of privileged solicitor-client
      advice, there may be circumstances where the need for confidentiality encompasses
      even the information that such advice has been obtained on a specific issue.
      However, in this case no such suggestion is made. The broad issue to be
      discussed in closed session on April 5 and May 17 was privileged legal
      advice concerning the renaming of the Square. This triggered the exception
      in s. 239(2)(f). In the circumstances of this case, nothing has been put
      forward to suggest that the use of a general description such as this would

      that may be taken in closed session. This vote was neither. It was not
      a vote for a procedural matter nor for giving directions to staff. However,
      s. 244 contemplates that such votes may happen and provides for the consequence.
      It says that such an unauthorized vote is of no effect. The section reads
      as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span

      would therefore conclude that the vote held in the closed meeting of April
      5 was not authorized by s. 239(6)(b) of the Act and was thus of no effect.
      I would not, however, characterize this as the respondent having violated
      the Act. It simply conducted a vote that the Act deems to have no legal
      effect.</span></p>

      summary, the respondent conducted two closed meetings that the Act permitted
      to be held in camera. Council did not pass the resolutions required by
      the Act prior to doing so. And, it conducted a vote at the first of these
      two meetings that was of no effect. </span></p>

      the meetings of April 5 and May 17 to the public did not violate s. 239(2)
      of the Act, given the subject matter being considered. It is true that
      Council did not pass the resolution required by s. 239(4)(b) prior to doing
      so and s. 239(6)(b) does not authorize the vote to approve in principle
      conducted at the April 5 meeting. However, as a matter of law, s. 244 renders
      that vote of no effect. And as a matter of fact, the application judge
      found that no final determination was made by Council at either closed
      meeting. Rather, he found that the real decision to pass the by-law was
      made at the public meeting of May 17 after a lengthy debate. Thus, I conclude
      that the failure to pass the necessary resolutions prior to going into
      closed session and the unauthorized vote held on April 5 are at most procedural
      irregularities unconnected to the real decision to pass the by-law. They
      therefore do not taint its legality.</span></p>

      public meeting at which the by-law was passed was purely perfunctory. Using
      the language of the application judge in this case, it could not be said
      that the “real decision”
    to pass the by-law was made at an open meeting of Council. As a result, I
