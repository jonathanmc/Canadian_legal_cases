    appellant seeks to set aside his conviction on 249 counts of fraudulently
    obtaining and attempting to obtain Goods and Services Tax (GST) refunds through
    a scheme that involved more than $1.5 million.  He alleges that he requested
    disclosure from the Crown to assist with his alibi at trial but the evidence
    was unavailable.  He therefore submits that the trial judge erred in failing
    to instruct the jury that the Crown was under an obligation to preserve evidence
    and the defence could not be faulted for not gaining access to the evidence
    before it was destroyed (the “Bero” error: see <i>R .v Bero</i> (2000), 151
    C.C.C. (3d) 545 (Ont. C.A.).  He now seeks to introduce fresh evidence (his
    employment records) which he claims support his alibi defence.  In his Notice
    of Appeal, the appellant asserted that the verdict was unreasonable and that
    the trial judge erred in failing to give an adequate <i>Vetrovec</i> warning
    in relation to the Crown’s principle witness, the appellant’s father, William
    Henderson Sr., but he abandoned these grounds in oral argument.  Separately,
    the Crown is appealing the sentence of eighteen months in custody, submitting
    that the appropriate sentence is four years.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Henderson was an auditor for Revenue
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  As such he had access to Revenue
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ’s GST accounts.  Each auditor has a unique user ID and password.  The evidence
    at trial was that the accounts were accessed in relation to fraudulently
    established farm accounts via the appellant’s user ID and password on many
    occasions.  Farmers do not pay GST on purchases relating to their farming
    businesses, and accordingly are entitled to rebates on the tax they pay. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was the Crown’s original theory, when the case commenced, that the appellant
    and his father conspired together to claim the false credits.  During trial
    the theory was expanded to include the existence of an inside co-worker acting
    as an accomplice to the appellant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    Sr. had pleaded guilty, and been sentenced, prior to the appellant’s trial,
    and gave evidence against the appellant at trial.  A co-worker of the appellant
    also testified that the appellant had discussed a similar scheme with her
    late in 1998, although he had subsequently told her he was joking, and that
    he confessed to her about the criminal activity afterwards.  In addition,
    a search of the basement of the appellant’s house revealed documents and
    computer disks related to the scheme (which he said had been placed there
    by his father).  Letters written to advance the scheme were created on the
    appellant’s home computer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s defence was in the nature of an alibi (of which the Crown was
    advised only a week before trial).  He said that he could only access the
    Revenue Canada accounts from his computer at the office (which was not contested)
    and that he was away from the office on the days when the fraudulent accessing
    was alleged to have occurred.  He said that someone working with him could
    easily have discovered his password (notwithstanding he had changed it at
    least three times during the period over which the fraud occurred), for instance
    by looking over his shoulder.  Essentially, his defence was that some other
    person inside the Revenue Canada office had stolen his user ID and password
    and used them to assist Henderson Sr. in committing the crime.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    support of that defence he produced a travel expense voucher showing that
    he was away from the office on at least two of the days in question and he
    maintained that he was offsite doing an audit (‘the Saugeen audit”) in the
    town of Durham on several other occasions.  He argued vigorously through
    cross-examination of the Crown witnesses, and through his counsel’s address
    to the jury, that he was precluded from cementing the validity of this defence
    because the Crown had destroyed, and was unable to produce, his employment
    records that would confirm his story.  The trial judge told the jury that
    the travel voucher created an
    “irresistible inference” that the appellant had been away from his office
    on those occasions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    lost evidence was the subject of a pre-trial motion to stay (subsequently
    withdrawn) and a post-conviction motion for a stay.  The trial judge allowed
    the post-conviction motion but did not grant a stay; instead he declared
    a mistrial.  The Crown appealed this decision to this Court, which set aside
    the order for a mistrial on the grounds that once the jury’s verdict was
    delivered and recorded the trial judge had no jurisdiction to order a mistrial.  It
    sent the matter back for sentencing.</p>

  <h3><u><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Times New Roman";'>The Fresh Evidence
        Application</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    lost documentation forms the primary basis for the fresh evidence application
    before us.  During the various post conviction proceedings the Crown has
    produced, as part of its ongoing disclosure obligations, documentation that
    confirms the Saugeen audit actually took place, and a further document – created
    post-conviction – that outlines hours worked by the appellant during the
    relevant periods.  The appellant says the former documentation would have
    enabled him to deflect the Crown’s attack at trial on the legitimacy of the
    travel expense voucher, and that the latter document demonstrates that he
    was working on a compressed work schedule and was not in the office on a
    number of Fridays on which the fraudulent accounts were accessed from his
    computer.  He also says that the latter document has refreshed his memory
    and that he was at the doctors on another such date in the morning and with
    his mother in the afternoon.  He is now able to produce medical evidence
    of the visit to the doctor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, none of the proposed fresh evidence meets the <i>Palmer</i> criteria
    for admission.  Much of it would have been available at trial if pursued
    with due diligence and in any event none of it would have had an impact on
    the jury’s verdict, in our view.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Only
    three documents were produced following the conviction: (a) the computer
    print out reconstructing the appellant’s work schedule mentioned above; (b)
    documentation confirming the existence of the Saugeen audit; and (c) Revenue
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    ’s internal investigation report that indicated there were discrete instances
    where other Revenue Canada employees (including his friend and co-worker)
    accessed the accounts in question.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the compressed work schedule does not assist the appellant because it does
    not establish his absence on specific days.  Whether he was in fact absent
    on those days is dependent upon his personal testimony to that effect, something
    that it was open to him to say at trial.  Similarly the investigation report
    would not have assisted the appellant.  He already had disclosure of all
    access dates to the fraudulent accounts and he could well have followed up
    on them with the Crown.  In particular, he would have recognized that the
    February 11, 1998 access – which turned out to be by his friend and co-worker,
    John Beda – took place well after he had left Revenue
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  He had in his possession a copy of an interview with John Beda, prior
    to trial, and an easy follow up request for information respecting the access
    on that date would have revealed the Beda access.  Both of these documents
    fail on the due diligence <i>Palmer</i> criterion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    medical record produced is not dispositive either.  The fresh evidence shows
    that the appellant’s computer was accessed many times during the afternoon
    of that date, January 30, 1996, and his story that he was with his mother
    that afternoon – recalled ten years after the event – is evidence that could
    well have been provided at trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the end of the day, the only persuasive documentary evidence in support of
    the appellant’s defence that he was absent on certain of the access days
    in question was the travel expense voucher respecting the Saugeen audit.  This
    document was before the jury, however, and as noted above the trial judge
    gave a strong instruction that it created an “irresistible inference” that
    the appellant was absent on those dates.  Accordingly, documentation confirming
    the actual existence of the Saugeen audit would have added little to the
    appellant’s defence at trial.</p>

    would not give effect to the argument that the trial judge failed to instruct
    the jury that the Crown had a duty to preserve documentation and that it
    was not the fault of the appellant that the documentation respecting his
    employment records and the template regarding the increased threshold had
    been destroyed or could not be found: <i>R v. Bero</i>, <i>supra</i>.</p>

    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ’s reasonable internal document retention policy, an explanation that was
    before the jury.  The unavailability of these documents, and the absence
    of the template, were front and centre in the appellant’s defence and well
    known to the jury.  At trial the appellant chose to utilize this absence
    as a basis for creating a reasonable doubt concerning his absences from the
    office, rather than asserting a failure to disclose on the part of the Crown
    as a ground for a stay.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raises no allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel.  It
    appears to us that the treatment of the missing documents was a tactical
    decision made by the defence at trial.  No <i>Bero</i> charge was requested.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the end, we are not persuaded that the absence of such a charge, even if
    applicable, would have led to a different verdict from the jury.  There was
    ample evidence upon which the appellant’s conviction could be based.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    our view, while a sentence imposed was undoubtedly at the extreme low end
    of the range for this type of offence, there were many circumstances particular

    underpinnings of the conviction in terms of the respondent’s role, as he
    was obliged to do.  While we may not have taken the same view of the evidence,
    and we are unsure the jury did either, the trial judge was entitled to his
    assessment of the jury’s verdict.  In the absence of palpable and overriding
    factual error or error in principle we are obliged to approach the appeal
    on the basis of the trial judge’s perspective of the respondent’s role.  On
