  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment
      of Justice David G. Stinson of the Superior Court of Justice dated September
      13, 2005.</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raises two issues on this appeal. The first is that the trial judge
    erred in his interpretation of the contract, with the result that the respondent
    was held to be entitled to retain a back-charge of $64,955.92 plus G.S.T.
    on a $1,697,736 contract.  The second issue is that the trial judge erred
    in the amount he awarded for costs, $93,604.17 inclusive of disbursements
    and G.S.T.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the interpretation of the contract issue, the appellant argues that the proper
    interpretation of the relevant provisions of the contract is that Coldmatic
    was not responsible for providing any of the electrical wiring beyond its
    refrigerated room and automatic doors. The trial judge found that although
    Coldmatic was not responsible for providing the main wiring that connected
    the refrigerated room with the electrical distribution panel, the contract,
    properly interpreted, provided that Coldmatic was responsible for certain
    “secondary wiring” that connected its installation to “disconnect boxes”,
    that then led to the main electrical distribution panel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    appears that while one of the disconnect boxes was required by the Electrical
    Code for the door operations, the other was put in by agreement on site but
    was not required by the Code. The trial judge relied in part on the broad
    description of Coldmatic’s responsibilities in the contract, which included “design…and
    install[ation of] the walk-in refrigerator and freezer panel system”, emphasizing
    its responsibility to provide a fully operational system. This was a designer-built
    project, and in our view, the trial judge was entitled to find that both
    disconnect boxes and the wiring leading to them from the system supplied
    by Coldmatic was within the scope of Coldmatic’s responsibility under the
    contract. We would therefore not give effect to the first ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s main concern with the award of costs at trial was that the amount
    awarded exceeded the amount in issue in the action. In our view, in the circumstances
    of this case, the trial judge made no error in his award of costs. Counsel
    for both sides spent similar amounts of time in the prosecution of this litigation,
    so that the appellant cannot say that the respondent’s counsel spent an inordinate
    amount of time that should not be reflected in an award of costs. A significant
    factor leading to this award was a Rule 49 offer that was not accepted by
    the appellant. We would grant leave to appeal the costs order but dismiss
    the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, the appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent fixed at
    $15,000, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
