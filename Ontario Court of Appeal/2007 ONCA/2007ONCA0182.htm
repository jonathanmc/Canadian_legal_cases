      entered on April 1, 2005 and the sentence imposed on June 8, 2005 by Justice
      Colin D.A. McKinnon of the Superior Court of Justice.</span></h4>
  <h2>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Galna was convicted of four counts of fraud and nine counts of encouraging
    others to act on a forged document.  He received a total sentence of four
    years and was ordered to make restitution of $662,000 USD.  He now appeals
    from conviction.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s position on appeal and trial is that he was entitled to use the
    investors’ funds in any manner that he chose.  In our view, there was overwhelming
    evidence to support the trial judge’s findings respecting the safekeeping
    representations made by the appellant regarding where the investors’ money
    would be held and the use that would be made of the funds.  The trial judge
    was entitled to accept, as he did, the evidence of the investors who testified,
    and whom he found to be credible, and the written documentation which contained
    such representations.  Instead of holding the funds in safekeeping, the trial
    judge found, on the basis of thorough forensic evidence, that the funds had
    been used by the appellant, primarily through the company Donbanx, for operational
    expenses.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
    we see no basis for interfering with the trial judge’s findings regarding
    the use of the investors’ funds.  In our view, the evidence overwhelmingly
    supports the fraud convictions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    the convictions on the counts involving forged documents were based on unimpeachable
    findings by the trial judge that the appellant did not have the protections
    in place, as represented, to guarantee the investments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    see nothing in the numerous other procedural fairness issues raised by the
    appellant.  The trial judge explicitly recognized the challenges that the
    appellant faced in conducting his own defence, given that he was self-represented
    at trial.  We begin by noting in this regard that, after sentence was passed,
    the appellant complimented the trial judge on his fairness and efforts to
    assist him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge repeatedly assisted the appellant including by identifying the
    relevant issues and assisting him in framing questions to elicit evidence
    that would be admissible and relevant.  He loaned the appellant a book on
    trial practice and gave an overview of the trial process.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    see nothing to support the allegations that the appellant was unfairly restricted
    in cross&#8209;examination of witnesses or in the making of closing submissions.  Where
    the cross&#8209;examination was curtailed, that was done either because it
    was not relevant or because the witness was unable to give evidence on the
    point.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we would dismiss the convictions appeal.</p>
