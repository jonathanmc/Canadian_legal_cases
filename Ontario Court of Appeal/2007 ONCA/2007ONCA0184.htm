    215 Glenridge Avenue in the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">

    St. Catharines.  The owner of the condominium unit brought an application
    in the Superior Court of Justice to have Ms. Waddington’s cats removed from
    the building.  The application was dismissed by Justice J. W. Quinn of the
    Superior Court of Justice.  The condominium owner did not appeal the dismissal
    of the application.  However, Niagara North Condominium Corp. No. 125, the
    appellant, brought a subsequent application for the same relief.  Justice
    L. Waters of the Superior Court of Justice dismissed the subsequent application
    as an abuse of process.  The appellant now appeals the judgment of Walters
    J.  </p>

    an apartment building which was converted to a condominium complex in June
    1997.</p>

    respondent, Ms. Heather Waddington, is the tenant of unit 410.  Unit 410

    215 Glenridge Avenue Ltd. Partnership is also referred to as the owner of
    unit 410 in these proceedings and no issue appears to be taken with that
    designation.  Ms. Waddington entered into a lease with the owner of the unit
    on May 5, 2003.  When she moved into unit 410, she brought her two cats with
    her.  The cats continue to live in unit 410.  </p>

    11, subsection 7 of the appellant’s Declaration provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>No animal, livestock, fowl, fish, reptile or insect
    (a “Pet”) shall be permitted or kept in the building.  Any owner shall, within
    two (2) weeks of receipt of written notice from a Board or Manager requesting
    removal of any such animal, permanently remove such animal from the property.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule

    evidence before the court indicated that before the building was converted
    to a condominium complex the occupants of the building were permitted to
    have pets in their apartments.  After the building was converted to a condominium
    complex, the persons who had pets in their apartments were permitted to keep
    them there until the pets either left or died.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    property manager of the appellant sent a letter to Ms. Waddington on November
    24, 2003 demanding that she remove her cats from the building by December
    8, 2003.  A second letter dated May 11, 2004 demanded that the cats be removed
    by May 25, 2004.  A third letter dated July 23, 2004 advised that an inspection
    of the condominium unit would take place on August 7, 2004 “to confirm there
    are no pets living in the unit and you are complying with Article 11 subsection
    7 of the Declaration”.  Finally, a letter dated October 26, 2004 addressed
    to Ms. Waddington from the property manager demanded that the cats be removed
    by November 15, 2004 and advised that an inspection would be carried out
    on November 16, 2004.  The letter of October 26, 2004 also indicated that
    failure to comply with the demand to remove the cats would result in litigation
    commenced by the appellant condominium corporation.  In particular, the letter
    said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If the pet(s) have not been permanently removed,
    this matter will be referred to the Corporation’s solicitor to obtain a court
    order to have the pet(s) permanently removed from the prop-erty.</p>

    followed.  However, it was the owner of the unit and not the appellant condominium
    corporation that commenced the proceedings.  On January 4, 2005,
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    215 Glenridge Avenue Ltd. Partnership, commenced its application (“the first
    application”) against Ms. Waddington for:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)     a declaratory order stating that Ms. Waddington
    is in breach of the Declaration of the Niagara North Condo-minium Corp. No.
    125; and,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)    a compliance order for the removal of the
    cats.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first application was supported by an affidavit of Richard Rosenman.  Attached
    to his affidavit are the four letters sent by the property manager of the
    appellant to Ms. Waddington dated November 24, 2003; May 11, 2004; July 23,
    2004; and October 26, 2004.  An affidavit of Peter Greco, the property manager
    of the appellant, was also filed in support of the first application.  Finally,
    an affidavit of Lynn Berthiaume, the building superintendent of the appellant,
    was filed in support of the first application.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first application proceeded before Justice J. W. Quinn of the Superior Court
    of Justice in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    St. Catharines on January 20, 2005.  Judgment was reserved to February 18,
    2005 when Justice Quinn released a six page endorsement in which he gave
    his reasons for dismissing the application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Quinn
    J. found that the provisions banning pets in the Declaration and the rules
    of the appellant condominium corporation failed to comply with the provisions
    of the <i>Condominium Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C. 26.  In paragraphs 16,
    17 and 18 of his reasons, Quinn J. said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[16]     Subsection 58(1) of the <i>Condominium
      Act</i> does not authorize a condominium corporation to make a blanket
      rule banning all pets.  Only if pets compromise “the safety, security or
      welfare of the [unit] owners and of the property and assets of the [condominium]
      corporation” (clause 58(1)(a)) or if they constitute an “unreasonable interference
      with the use and enjoyment of the common elements, the units or the assets
      of the [condominium] corporation (clause 58(1)(b)), may the board of directors
      ban or prohibit their presence.  There is no evidence that the cats of
      the respondent run afoul of clauses (a) or (b) of subsection 58(1).  And
      it cannot be said that the presence of all pets inherently constitutes
      a breach of those clauses.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[17]     I also think that, if any part of a declaration
    conflicts with subsection 58(1) it is void and unenforceable.  In other words,
    where, pursuant to clause 7(4)(b) of the <i>Condominium Act</i>, a declaration
    contains “conditions or restrictions with respect to the occupation and use
    of the units or common elements,” a condominium corporation cannot go beyond
    that which is permitted in subsection 58(1).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[18]     Consequently, the declaration and rules
    of the Corpor-ation are insufficient to prohibit the presence of the cats.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    owner of unit 410 did not appeal the decision of Quinn J.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    September 20, 2005, seven months after the decision of Quinn J. was released,
    the appellant issued a notice of application (“the second application”) in
    the Superior Court against Ms. Waddington, in which it sought the same relief
    as had been sought by the owner of the condominium unit in the first application,
    i.e. the removal of the two cats from the condominium unit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant filed an affidavit of its property manager, Peter Greco, in support
    of the second application.  The Greco affidavit contained essentially the
    same evidence that had been placed before the judge in the first application,
    including the letters dated November 24, 2003; May 11, 2004; July 23, 2004;
    and October 26, 2004 addressed to Ms. Waddington demanding the removal of
    her two cats from the building.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Waddington filed two affidavits in opposition to the second application.  She
    deposed that she suffers from a brain injury and is disabled.  She receives
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario disability support and lives on a limited income.  She deposed that
    she had never received any complaints about her cats.  She attached a report
    to her affidavit from her psychologist who opined that Ms. Waddington’s cats
    are an important focus in her life and that they make a significant contribution
    to her health and well-being.  Her psychologist further said that she would
    suffer an unreasonable and unnecessary hardship if she were required to give
    up her cats.  Ms. Waddington’s family physician also provided a report in
    which she said that, “her cats are a vital part of her life and I know that
    the loss of her treasured pets would set her back considerably”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second application was heard by Walters J. on January 5, 2006.  She dismissed
    the second application.  Her endorsement reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Last year the owner of the unit in question brought
    an application against the same Resp. requesting the exact same relief in
    this application.  Justice Quinn denied the appli-cation.  No appeal was
    taken.  The Cond. Corpn. which knew all the particulars of the first application – in
    fact it’s employee swore the affid. used in the appln. never asked to be
    joined in the action to be heard either in front of Quinn J. or at a subsequent
    appeal.  The exact same facts + issues are before me as were in front of
    Quinn J. last year.  Although technically this may not be <i>res judicata</i>,
    as the applicant is a different party, the issues are identical.  In these
    circum-stances proceeding with the appln. would be an abuse of process.  The
    applicant wants an appeal of Quinn J.’s order without going through the appeal
    process.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Appl. also asked that motion be adj so that this
    matter could be placed back before Quinn J.   With respect, all that would
    do is ask Quinn J. to sit on appeal of his earlier decision.  This is prejudicial
    to the Resp.  Accordingly, the Appln is dismissed.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Resp. is entitled to costs fixed in the amount
    of $2,500, incl of GST &amp; disb.</p>

    appellant submits that the application judge erred in law when she failed
    to articulate and apply the legal test for abuse of process.  In particular,
    the appellant asserts that the application judge was required to ensure that
    her decision on the issue of whether the second application constituted an
    abuse of process resulted in fairness and justice to the parties.  </p>

    application judge did not articulate a test for abuse of process.  Abuse
    of process is a doctrine designed to provide a remedy in a variety of situations
    including a remedy for the unfairness of relitigating the same issue against
    the same party in circum-stances where issue estoppel does not apply.  Abuse
    of process is essentially a fairness doctrine.  In
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Toronto</i><i> (City) v. Canadian

    Union of Public Employees (C.U.P.E.), Local 79</i>, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 77, Arbour
    J. engaged in a thorough review of the doctrine.  She cited with approval
    at para. 37 the dissenting judgment of Goudge J.A. in <i>Canam Enterprises
    Inc. v. Coles</i> (2000), 51 O.R. (3d) 481 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at paras. 55-56:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   The doctrine of abuse of process engages the
    inherent power of the court to prevent the misuse of its procedure, in a
    way that would be manifestly unfair to a party to the litigation before it
    or would in some other way bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  It
    is a flexible doctrine unencum-bered by the specific requirements of concepts
    such as issue estoppel.  See <i>House of Spring Gardens Ltd. v. Waite</i>,
    [1990] 3 W.L.R. 347 at p. 358, [1990] 2 All E.R. 990 (

    ).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   One circumstance in which abuse of process has
    been applied is where the litigation before the court is found to be in essence
    an attempt to relitigate a claim which the court has already determined.</p>

    Lange, <i>The Doctrine of Res Judicata in Canada</i> (2000) at pp. 347-48
    in support of the policy grounds which underlie abuse of process in these
    circumstances:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The two policy grounds, namely, that there be an
    end to ligitation and that no one should be twice vexed by the same cause,
    have been cited as policies in the application of abuse of process by religitation.  Other
    policy grounds have also been cited, namely, to preserve the courts’ and
    the litigants’ resources, to uphold the integrity of the legal system in
    order to avoid inconsistent results, and to protect the principle of finality
    so crucial to the proper administration of justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the application judge’s very brief endorsement does not provide a fulsome
    analysis of the issues to be decided by her, it is clear that she concluded
    that to permit the second application to proceed would be unfair and unjust
    given that the identical claim was disposed of in the first application and
    considering the appellant’s apparent involve-ment in the initiation of the
    first application.  While one might have preferred a more fulsome set of
    reasons from the application judge, I do not find her endorsement to be so
    bereft of analysis that it does not explain why she reached her conclusion.  Her
    endorsement taken together with the application record provides this court
    with a basis to engage in meaningful appellate review.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Did the application judge err
      in failing to consider the statutory scheme of the <i>Condominium Act</i> and

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge did not consider the relevant sections of the <i>Condominium
    Act</i> and the merits of the case.  Since she dealt with the application
    before her on the basis of abuse of process she did not go further.  Indeed
    she expressly told counsel for the appellant that she did not intend to consider
    the merits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But,

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  Would that be a decisive factor in favour of
    the appellant?  In other circumstances, an erroneous decision on the merits
    in the initial proceeding might make a difference although we were not cited
    any authority in support of that proposition.  In any event, in these circum-stances,
    where the unit owner (the first applicant) and the appellant (the second
    applicant) were so inextricably connected to the identical claim against
    the same respondent, I think an erroneous decision, if there be one, is not
    a decisive factor.  The unit owner could have exercised his right of appeal
    to the Court of Appeal but did not.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;page-break-after:auto'><span lang=EN-US>Did the
      application judge err in failing to consider the prejudice to the appellant
      and the owners?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the application judge failed to consider the prejudice
    to the appellant in not being able to enforce the no pets prohibition and
    the uncertainty caused in the building with respect to the housing of pets
    as a result of the decision in the first application.  It seems to me that
    if there was any such prejudice, it was not of such a degree that would justify
    setting aside the application judge’s exercise of discretion in this case.   </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;page-break-after:auto'><span lang=EN-US>Did the
      application judge err in failing to consider that the owner of the condo-minium
      unit and Ms. Waddington should have taken steps to join the appellant in
      the first application? </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the application judge should have considered that
    neither the owner of the condominium unit nor Ms. Waddington took any steps
    to add the appellant as a party to the first application to ensure that the
    result would be binding on the appellant.  The appellant cites rule 5.03(1)
    and rule 5.03(4) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, which deal with the joinder
    of necessary parties.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, there was no obligation on Ms. Waddington to move to add the appellant
    as a party to the application.  In all probability, counsel for Ms. Waddington,
    if he put his mind to it, would have assumed that the appellant made a conscious
    decision not to join in the application.  In any event, the fact that the
    appellant was not a party to the first application, was likely the subject
    of some discussion between it and the unit owner.  If they concluded that
    the unit owner alone would proceed in order to avoid potential costs or other
    consequences so be it.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;page-break-after:auto'><span lang=EN-US>Did the
      application judge err in failing to consider the importance, relative ease
      and practicality of intervening?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    a dialogue, at the hearing of the second application, between the application
    judge and counsel for the appellant, the application judge suggested that
    the appellant could have sought to be added as a party in the first application.  The
    appellant submits that this would not have been practical.  First, the appellant
    argues that on such a motion, the unit owner would likely have opposed the
    motion because the appellant would have sought its costs against the unit
    owner which are provided for in the condominium declaration.  This argument
    is pure speculation.  Given the co-operation that existed between the unit
    holder and the appellant, I think this is an unlikely scenario.  Second,
    the appellant argues that it would have had no reason to believe that there
    was any risk of the unit owner not succeeding in his claim and therefore
    presumably had no reason to seek to be added as a party.  If that is so,
    then the appellant made a tactical decision and must accept the consequences.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Did the trial judge err in
      failing to understand that the appellant had no right of appeal from the
      decision in the first application?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the application judge’s endorsement is read as a whole, I believe it is clear
    that she fully understood that the appellant could not appeal the decision
    in the first application.  Her words: “the applicant wants an appeal of Quinn
    J.’s order without going through the appeal process” must be read in context.  The
    gist of her reasoning is that the appellant in the second application was,
    in effect, attempting to appeal the first decision.  Although there was considerable
    discussion between the application judge and counsel for the appellant concerning
    the possibility of the appellant becoming involved in an appeal on the first
    application, I do not accept that any of that discussion would lead this
    court to reverse her decision on abuse of process.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;page-break-after:auto'><span lang=EN-US>Did the
      application judge err in failing to consider that the appellant had no
      opportunity to make submissions to the court in the first application?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the application judge failed to consider the unfairness
    of the first application judge’s decision in light of the fact that before
    Quinn J. determined the appellant’s pet prohibitions to be unenforceable,
    he did not accord the appellant the opportunity to make submissions on the
    issue.  I see no merit in this argument.  As already observed, the appellant
    obviously made a conscious decision not to join in the first application
    as a party.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;page-break-after:auto'><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    accept that the application judge was entitled, in the circumstances of this
    case, to invoke the doctrine of abuse of process.  Here we have the relitigation
    of an identical claim against Ms. Waddington.  Although the appellant was
    not a party to the first application, the appellant took the initiative in
    making the demands on Ms. Waddington to remove her cats and threatened litigation
    against her.  When she did not comply with the demands to remove the cats,
    the unit owner was the named applicant in the first application.  However,
    the appellant provided virtually all of the evidence in respect of the application.  Although
    not a party in the formal sense, the appellant was an active participant
    in promoting the first application.</p>
