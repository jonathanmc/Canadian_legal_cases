  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment
      of Justice Nancy M. Mossip of the Superior Court of Justice dated June
      6, 2005 and the order made by Justice Mossip dated August 5, 2005.</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raises two grounds of appeal. The first is that the trial judge
    erred because having found that the parties were partners in the Muskoka
    business, she failed to find that the <i>Partnership Act</i> applies and
    that on dissolution of the partnership, the appellant is entitled to a half
    interest in the entire property. We do not accept this submission. The trial
    judge found that the parties were partners but that their partnership relationship
    was governed wholly by the Acknowledgment document that they executed when
    the property was purchased by the numbered company. The respondent provided
    all of the funds for the purchase and agreed to hold 50 percent of the shares
    on the basis that the appellant had an exclusive option to purchase for three
    years. As he did not purchase within that time or ever, he lost that option.
    The fact that he made a contribution to the partnership by working does not
    change the result. He received a share of the profits of the business while
    he worked there. Under the express terms of the Acknowledgement, the appellant
    acquired no right to the shares in the numbered company unless he made the
    required payments. He did not make those payments and it follows that the
    shares never became “partnership property” within the meaning of the <i>Partnership
    Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree that the appellant’s contribution of $50,000 at the time the property
    was refinanced should be characterized as a partial payment on the option
    and not as a loan. However, because the appellant did not comply with the
    condition of the option by contributing his full 50 percent share, he lost
    that opportunity. The trial judge made no error in holding that his remedy
    is a return of the $50,000 with interest. To the extent that paragraph 3
    of the Judgment may not reflect that outcome, it may be amended.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred by failing to allow
    the appellant to amend his defence after judgment in order to rely on the
    failure of the respondent to give notice under the <i>PPSA</i> before appropriating
    the appellant’s 50 percent of the shares. We also reject this submission.
    We agree with the conclusion reached by the trial judge on the motion to
    re-open the case and amend the statement of defence that the arrangement
    between the parties did not constitute a security interest in the shares,
    but was in essence a conditional option to purchase. Consequently, the <i>PPSA</i> is
    not applicable.</p>

line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs, fixed at $10,000.</p>
