'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is a sentence appeal.  The appellant pleaded guilty before Justice Festeryga
    in the Superior Court of Justice to charges which covered a time period of
    April 24, 2003 to June 3, 2003.  Four of the charges involved three non-violent
    break and enters and a possession over charge.  The remaining four charges
    included two counts of assault with intent to steal, break and enter and
    robbery and possession of a prohibited firearm.  The latter four charges
    involved three incidents of significant violence or threatened violence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first incident occurred on May 4, 2003 shortly after the appellant smoked
    crack with a female friend.  The two elected to steal a car from a parking
    lot by using a crowbar to break its steering column.  When the owner of the
    car, who was in his mid-sixties, unexpectedly arrived, there was a confrontation.  Anticipating
    an assault, the owner of the car struck the appellant in the face with his
    fist.  The appellant then knocked the owner of the car down, hit him with
    the crowbar and repeatedly punched and kicked him.  The appellant yelled
    to his friend to run over the owner of the car while he was prone.  The owner
    of the car eventually gave up the fight and the appellant removed his wallet,
    which contained about $1,450 in cash, then fled in the car. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second incident occurred on May 29, 2003 in a farmhouse in a rural area.  At
    about 2:30 in the morning, the owner of the house, a 76-year-old man, awoke
    to the sound of somebody in the house.  The owner of the house got out of
    bed, armed himself with a registered .25 calibre handgun, and investigated
    the noise.  In the area of his bathroom, the appellant surprised the owner
    of the house from behind and knocked him to the floor.  The appellant was
    armed with a knife and managed to disarm the owner of the house.  The appellant
    ordered the owner of the house into the bedroom at gunpoint and demanded
    to know where the safe was as he ransacked the room.  Another struggle ensued
    and the gun discharged, sending a bullet through the homeowner’s hip into
    his right buttock.  The appellant stole the homeowner’s car keys and fled
    in his car, abandoning it a short distance away.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third incident occurred on June 2, 2003 at about 6:20 in the morning.  The
    appellant pushed into the office of a motel with what appeared to be a sawed-off
    shotgun and confronted the female proprietor saying to her, “give me the
    money or I’ll shoot you.”  She fled through a door in the back of the office
    and told her son to call 9-1-1.  The appellant fled in a get-away car without
    having stolen any money or causing injury to anyone. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was 31 years old at the time of sentencing.  He had a lengthy criminal
    record, which included robbery, break and enter and theft, threatening, assault
    with a weapon, mischief, various property offences and failure to comply
    with court orders.  He was described in his pre-sentence report as a career
    criminal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant comes from a family where he was subjected to significant physical
    abuse from his father.  The appellant has a Grade 12 education.  The appellant
    had a four year common-law relationship with a woman.  There is a son from
    that relationship.   Access to his son has waned.  </p>

'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant has a history of drug addiction which underlies his criminal activity.  Due
    to his criminal activity, he has not engaged in much legitimate employment
    although he has job skills in roofing, welding and working with heavy equipment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time of sentencing, the appellant was treated as having served two years
    and seven months pre-trial custody.  During the pre-trial custody, the appellant,
    on his own initiative, acted as an informer for the jail authorities.  The
    evidence before the sentencing judge was that the information provided to
    the jail authorities was extremely useful and led to at least one arrest
    and conviction as well as appropriate action related to others.</p>

    respect of the three non-violent break and enter charges and the possession
    over charge, counsel for the Crown and defence agreed on a joint submission.  Crown
    and defence agreed that the appellant would be sentenced to one year and
    eight months of his pre-trial custody which, on a basis of a two-for-one
    credit, would be an effective sentence of three years and four months. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect of the four remaining charges, arising out of the three violent incidents,
    there was no agreement between the Crown and defence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the appellant at the sentencing hearing submitted that the judge should
    give three-for-one credit for the remaining eleven months of pre-trial custody
    followed by a conditional sentence of two years less a day. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the Crown suggested that the appellant should receive credit of one to
    two years for his assistance to the jail authorities and two-for-one credit
    for the remaining eleven months of pre-trial custody followed by an additional
    six years in custody.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Sentence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge accepted the joint submission in relation to the non-violent
    break and enters and possession charge.  In regard to the charges arising
    out of the three violent incidents, he sentenced the appellant to a further
    six years in custody.  In coming to this conclusion, the sentencing judge
    said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I find that an appropriate range of sentence would
    be eight to ten years as suggested by the Crown for the home invasion and
    an additional two years for the brutal and serious assaults, for a total
    of 12 years.  He shall be allowed some leniency for cooperating with the
    authorities to bring jail guards and other citizens to justice, and undertaking
    to cooperate with the police in a murder investigation.  The net sentence
    will be eight years after being given that leniency.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>He shall also be given credit for 11 months pre-sentence
    custody and I am allowing two-for-one, or two years, and therefore, the sentence
    will be a global sentence of six years for counts one, three, six and seven
    on indictment J-05-24 to be served concurrently and concurrently to the sentence
    on the other counts…</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the appellant submits that the trial judge made two errors in sentencing
    the appellant in respect of the convictions arising out of the three violent
    incidents.  The first error relates to a failure to take into account the “jump”
    principle.  The second error relates to a failure to give sufficient credit
    to the appellant for his assistance to the jail authorities. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the appellant argues that before giving credit to the appellant for his
    assistance to the authorities and credit for pre-trial custody that the appropriate
    sentence in this case is eight years.  Counsel submits that the longest sentence
    served by the appellant to date is eleven months for break and enter plus
    ninety days for breach of probation.  He reasons that a twelve year sentence
    is too big a jump. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    submitting that the trial judge erred in failing to give adequate credit
    for the assistance provided to the authorities, counsel relies on the reasons
    for judgment of Hill J. of the Superior Court of Justice in <i>R. v. John
    Doe</i> (1999), 142 C.C.C. (3d) 330. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the above case, John Doe pleaded guilty to importing one and a half kilograms
    of cocaine into
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    from
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Jamaica</st1:country-region>
    .  The cocaine had an estimated street value exceeding $250,000.  After arrest
    and before sentencing, Doe provided information to the police, which led
    to the arrest of others involved in two separate transactions.  The sentencing
    judge concluded that ordinarily, a just and fit sentence would be four to
    five years in the penitentiary.  However, given the exceptional circumstances
    of helping the police, he was given a conditional sentence of two years less
    a day.   </p>

'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hill
    J. engaged in a thorough review of the circumstances under which a sig-nificant
    discount should be given in sentencing an accused person who has provided
    meaningful assistance to the police and other authorities. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    considering the quantification of a discount for informer assistance, Hill
    J. said at para. 42:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Cooperation of a high order requires a meaningful
    discount.  However, an accused who has under consideration the role of police
    informer is understandably, and not unreasonably, anxious to know that the
    assistance provided will have a real effect in his or her own criminal proceeding.  Perhaps,
    to this end, some courts have expressly stated that real or valuable assistance
    uncovering serious criminality will draw sub-stantial credit, perhaps a one-half
    to two-thirds reduction in the otherwise appropriate sentencing disposition: <i>R.
    v. King,</i> [1985] 7 Cr. App. R. (S) 227 at p. 230; <i>R. v. Sehitoglu and
    Ozaken,</i> [1984] 1 Cr. App. R. (S) 89 at p. 95; <i>R. v. Perrier and Richardson </i>(1990),
    59 A. Crim. R. 164 at p. 172.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the appellant urges that we accept eight years as the starting point
    and further submits that the discount for informer assistance should be a
    one-half to two-thirds reduction in respect of eight years.  After applying
    that discount and the two-for-one credit for the remaining eleven months
    of pre-trial custody, the appellant submits that he should receive a conditional
    sentence in respect of the remaining time. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect of the appellant’s submission that a “jump”
    from incarceration of eleven months plus ninety days to twelve years is too
    great, counsel for the respondent submitted that the home invasion conviction
    alone warranted a sentence of ten years.  See <i>R. v. Wright</i> (2006),
    218 O.A.C. 215.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    of the three offences involved a significant degree of violence.  The third
    offence involved a threat with a sawed off shotgun.  One of the offences
    involved a house invasion.  In the circumstances, I do not accept that there
    has been a violation of the “jump” principle. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect of the appropriate credit for the appellant’s assistance to the jail
    authorities, I do not think that the trial judge erred in failing to apply
    a discount of one-half to two-thirds of the appropriate sentence.  The three
    cases cited by Hill J. in <i>R. v. John Doe</i> in support of a discount
    of that magnitude are from the English and Australian courts.  Although the
    cases are persuasive, they are non-binding authorities.  Each of those cases
    involved fact situations different from this case.  I also note that the <i>John
    Doe</i> case was a narcotics importing case which involved an accused with
    no prior criminal record. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hill
    J. in <i>John Doe</i> does not purport to set a fixed tariff for discounts
    in the sentencing of police informants.  His language is carefully qualified
    at paragraph 43 of his reasons for judgment:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The just allowance will, of course, vary case to
    case depending on a discretionary assessment of individual cir-cumstances
    measuring the extent to which the actions of a co-operative accused justify
    a particular result.  John Doe was the beneficiary of such an approach.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    authorities of this court and other courts make it clear that the sentencing
    of an accused is dependent upon the individual circumstances of the accused
    and the offence committed.  In my view, the informer discount of four years
    cannot be said to be inappropriate in the circumstances of this case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    submission that the appellant should receive a conditional sentence appears
    to me to be entirely out of the question.  This appellant has a lengthy criminal
    record and these offences involve significant violence.  But for his assistance
    to the jail authorities, he would be receiving a sentence of twelve years
    on these offences.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    additional credit of two years for pre-trial custody is not challenged in
    this appeal and is appropriate.</p>

'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In

    for the appellant has requested that we make a formal order pursuant to s.&nbsp;684(1)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i> appointing him as counsel to the appellant.  The
    result of such an order is that the fees and disbursements of counsel are
    paid by the Attorney General.  In making an order under this section, the
    court considers whether there is an arguable case on the merits.  If there
    is an arguable case, “the question becomes – can the appellant effectively
    advance his grounds of appeal without the assistance of counsel?”  See <i>R.
    v. Bernardo</i> (1998), 121 C.C.C. (3d) 123 at para. 24 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  In answering this question, Doherty J.A. said in <i>Bernardo</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This inquiry looks to the complexities of the arguments
    to be advanced and the appellant’s ability to make an oral argument in support
    of the grounds of appeal.  The complexity of the argument is a product of
    the grounds of appeal, the length and content of the record on appeal, the
    legal principles engaged, and the application of those principles to the
    facts of the case.  An appellant’s ability to make arguments in support of
    his or her grounds of appeal turns on a number of factors, including the
    appellant’s ability to understand the written word, com-prehend the applicable
    legal principles, relate those principles to the facts of the case, and articulate
    the end product of that process before the court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if it can be said that there was an arguable case, based on <i>John Doe</i>,
    it cannot be said that the appellant could not have effectively advanced
    his two grounds of appeal without the assistance of counsel.  Indeed, during
    the course of the argument, the appellant made articulate interjections from

    appellant would have had the assistance of experienced duty counsel in any
    event. </p>

    the court was assisted by the submissions of Mr. Williams on behalf of the
    appellant, this is not a case in which the court should make an order under
    s. 684(1).  That said, Mr. Williams is to be commended for taking on this
    case on a <i>pro bono</i> retainer.</p>
