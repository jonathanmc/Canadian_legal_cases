'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    litigation concerns a failed business partnership formed in the early 1970s
    by two friends, Joseph Husar and Felice Marignani, for the purpose of purchasing
    land and developing a subdivision of residential building lots for resale.  The
    central issue concerns the entitlement of Husar to demand an accounting of
    partnership profits eigh-teen years after the effective collapse of the partnership.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that Husar, by his conduct, both proposed and agreed to
    the dissolution of the partnership by January 1981.  He held that Marignani
    owed Husar the duties of a fiduciary, including the duty to account, and
    that Husar was entitled to an accounting of partnership profits as at the
    partnership dissolution date.  In the trial judge’s view, Husar lacked the
    information necessary to determine whether he had a cause of action against
    Marignani when the partnership was terminated.  Consequently, Husar’s entitlement
    to an accounting of profits as at January 1981 was not barred by laches or
    acquiescence, notwithstanding his significant delay in advancing a claim
    against Marignani.  In contrast, because of the 1981 dissolution of the partnership,
    the trial judge also concluded that Husar was not entitled to share in any
    post-dissolution partnership profits.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, the trial judge held that Marignani and P &amp; M Construction
    Limited (“P &amp; M”), a company controlled by Marignani, were liable to
    Husar and John Massarelli, an assignee of part of Husar’s interest in the
    partnership, for their share of partnership profits accrued as at January
    30, 1981 – the date of the dissolution of the partnership.  The trial judge
    also awarded Husar and Massarelli prejudgment interest and costs of the trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Marignani
    and P &amp; M appeal on various grounds from the trial judge’s liability
    holding, his assessment of damages and his awards of prejudgment interest
    and costs.  On behalf of Husar, who died in July 2000,<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> Husar’s estate cross-appeals from the trial judge’s
    decision that Husar and Massarelli were not entitled to recover any post-dissolution
    partnership profits, from the rate of prejudgment interest awarded by the
    trial judge, and from the quantum of the trial judge’s costs award.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I conclude that the trial judge erred by holding
    that Husar and Massarelli are entitled to an accounting of partnership profits
    as at January 30, 1981.  Given Husar’s conduct, including his extraordinary
    and unreasonable delay in seeking redress against Marignani and P &amp; M,
    it is my opinion that the doctrine of laches defeats Husar’s and Massarelli’s
    right to insist on an accounting at this late date.  Accordingly, I would
    allow the appeal and dismiss the action against Marignani and P &amp;
    M.  It follows that I would also dismiss the cross-appeal in its entirety.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US>II.        Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    approximately 1972, Husar and Marignani agreed to purchase a parcel of land
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Port Colborne,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario (the “Property”) for the sum of $63,500.  They intended to subdivide
    the Property into residential building lots for resale.  Husar, a real estate
    agent, introduced Marignani to the Property while it was subject to a real
    estate listing.  To avoid the payment of real estate commission on the purchase,
    Husar and Marignani acquired the Property after the expiry of the listing
    agreement and arranged for title to be registered in the name of Emilio Magnanelli,
    a friend of Marignani.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    document their bargain, the parties entered into a written agreement in February
    1972 (the “1972 Agreement”), which provided: (i) Magnanelli held the Property
    in trust as partnership property for Marignani and Husar; (ii) Marignani
    would pay the downpayment on the Property; (iii) Marignani would be paid “all
    of the moneys expended for the purchase of the [Property] out of profits
    realized from the sale of the [Property]”; (iv) all other expenditures would
    be borne equally by Marignani and Husar; and (v) nothing would be done to
    the Property without Marignani’s and Husar’s concurrence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    accordance with the 1972 Agreement, Marignani paid a $15,000 downpayment
    on the Property.  The balance of the purchase price, in the sum of $48,500,
    was raised by mortgage financing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About
    two years later, in May 1974, Husar sold one-half of his interest in the
    partnership to another friend, John Massarelli, in exchange for $57,500 and
    the assump-tion by Massarelli of liability for one-quarter of the amount
    then outstanding on the mortgage on the Property.  The funds paid by Massarelli
    were retained by Husar for his own use.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties dispute whether Marignani was informed of this transaction.  How-ever,
    it is uncontested that his consent to the sale and the involvement of Massarelli
    was neither sought nor provided.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    development of the Property proceeded in stages.  The costs of Phase I, which
    involved the creation of nineteen residential building lots, were substantial.  Marignani’s
    expenditures for this Phase appear to have been in the approximate amount
    of $353,000.  For his part, by June 1978, Husar had contributed only the
    aggregate amount of $26,600 to the expenses of the partnership.  Contrary
    to his obligations under the 1972 Agree-ment, he made no other payments at
    any time concerning the costs of the development project.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the costs of the development mounted, Husar acknowledged that he was unable
    to pay his share of the expenses.  In about 1980, he told Marignani that
    he
    “should do what he want[ed]” with the Property.  It appears that Husar did
    not inform Massarelli of this statement to Marignani.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Marignani
    took Husar’s statement to mean that Husar was ending his involvement in the
    partnership and that he was turning the entire venture, including the Property,
    over to Marignani.  As a result, on January 30, 1981, Marignani arranged
    for title to the Property to be transferred from Magnanelli to P &amp; M.  No
    consideration was paid to Husar in respect of this transfer; nor did he seek
    any, although he was aware of the conveyance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the years that followed, Marignani and Husar remained friends and continued
    to see each other socially.  To Husar’s knowledge, Marignani proceeded with
    the development of the Property, at Marignani’s sole expense and without
    Husar’s further involvement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    the end of 1987, fifteen Phase I building lots had been sold at a price of
    about $15,000 per lot.  Marignani built houses on the remaining unsold four
    lots, and operated them as rental properties.  Phase II of the development
    was undertaken in the mid- to late-1980s.  As occurred with Phase I, some
    of the Phase II lots were sold, while others became rental properties that
    were operated by Marignani or P &amp; M.  None of the sale proceeds or rental
    revenues from the development was paid to Husar or Massarelli.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
    1981 onwards, Husar had no involvement with the partnership.  He appeared
    to have ‘washed his hands’ of any participation in, or obligation in respect
    of, the partnership and the development of the Property.  For his part, Massarelli
    had no dealings of any kind with Marignani or P &amp; M.  Indeed, he met
    Marignani only once, at a social function.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1998, at the urging of Massarelli, Husar asked Marignani for an accounting
    of the profits from the sale or the rental of the lots.  Husar and Marignani
    exchanged oral offers regarding the proposed transfer of some of the building
    lots to Husar, but no transfer occurred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    January 1999, when the accounting requested by Husar was not forthcoming,
    Husar and Massarelli sued Marignani, P &amp; M and Magnanelli, claiming various
    declar-atory relief, damages in the amount of $3.5 million for alleged breach
    of trust and fiduciary duty, and $1 million in punitive damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    positions of the parties in the litigation were starkly divided.  Husar and
    Massarelli maintained that the partnership between Husar and Marignani was “valid
    and subsisting” and that it had not been terminated prior to Husar’s death
    in 2000.  They alleged that the Property was partnership property and that,
    by virtue of the 1981 transfer of the Property to P &amp; M, each of Marignani,
    P &amp; M and Magnanelli were in breach of trust and fiduciary duty, with
    the result that they were “liable to account for all dealings with the Property” from
    the date of its acquisition in 1972.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants Marignani and P &amp; M, together with Magnanelli, denied any
    breach of trust or duty on their part.  They alleged that Husar breached
    the 1972 Agree-ment and abandoned the partnership prior to the transfer of
    the Property to P &amp; M.  In the alternative, they claimed that if a valid
    agreement between Husar and Marignani was found to be in effect, an accounting
    of the entire partnership venture should be ordered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    action was tried in the fall of 2004 before Rouleau J. of the Superior Court
    of Justice, as he then was.  He accepted that the 1972 Agreement established
    a partnership between Husar and Marignani concerning the purchase and development
    of the Property.  However, he found that Marignani and Massarelli were not
    partners and that Husar’s dealings with Marignani bound Massarelli, with
    whom Husar had a separate relationship.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    relevant to these proceedings, the trial judge’s key findings include the
    following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)     contrary to Husar’s contention, the 1972
    Agreement had not been amended to relieve Husar from his obligation to pay
    fifty per cent of the expenditures regarding the Property;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)    Husar’s statement to Marignani that he “should
    do as he want[ed] with the land” amounted to a proposal, which was accepted
    by Marignani and which bound Massarelli, that the Partnership be dissolved;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii)   when Husar made this statement to Marignani,
    he “did not have sufficient information regarding the financial situation
    of the partnership to have acted in a knowing manner”;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iv)   although Husar was aware of it, he did not
    object to the 1981 transfer of the Property from Magnanelli to P &amp; M.  This
    transfer marked the dissolution of the partnership by mutual agreement; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(v)     Marignani did not pay Husar for this “acquisition
    of the partnership assets”.  Nor did Husar seek an accounting from Marignani
    when the partnership was dissolved;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(vi)   Marignani honestly believed in 1981 and
    thereafter that the partnership was not “profitable”.  He regularly told
    Husar that there had been
    “no profit” and that the part-nership had “no value”;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(vii)  in fact, when the partnership was dissolved
    on January 31, 1981, it had a “net positive value”, after all expen-ditures,
    of $74,235.97;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(viii) Marignani was in a fiduciary position towards
    Husar and owed him a duty to account for partnership assets that he acquired
    upon the dissolution of the partnership;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ix)   by proposing an end to the partnership,
    Husar did not abandon his right to share in partnership profits accrued as
    at the date of the dissolution of the partnership, although he had no right
    to share in any post-dissolution profits;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(x)    Marignani failed both to maintain separate
    books of account for the partnership and to account to Husar for partnership
    profits accrued as at the date of the dis-solution of the partnership; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(xi)   Husar was unaware in 1981 of facts sufficient
    to lead a reasonable person to believe that he had a possible claim against
    Marignani.  Accordingly, the action commenced by him in 1999 was not barred
    either by laches or ac-quiescence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    judgment dated March 7, 2005, the trial judge held that Marignani and P &amp; M
    were liable to each of Husar and Massarelli in the sum of $37,117.99 on account
    of partnership profits accrued as at January 30, 1981, the date of the partnership
    dissolution.  The trial judge also awarded Husar and Massarelli prejudgment
    interest at the rate of five per cent per annum, commencing on January 30,
    1981, and their costs of the action, fixed in the total amount of $120,000.  </p>

    the grounds of appeal raised by Marignani and P
    &amp; M, I address two main issues in these reasons.  First, I am satisfied
    that the appellants had adequate notice of the theory of liability that grounded
    the trial judge’s liability holding.  Accordingly, I would reject their contention
    that they were deprived of trial fairness.  Second, I am also persuaded that
    the trial judge erred by concluding that laches did not defeat any entitle-ment
    of Husar and Massarelli to an accounting of partnership profits as at the
    date of the dissolution of the partnership.  I turn first to the issue of
    the trial judge’s liability holding.    </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>(1)       Foundation of Liability Holding</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s liability holding rested on his findings that the partnership
    was dissolved by mutual agreement on January 30, 1981 – the date on which
    title to the Property was transferred to P &amp; M –
    and that Husar and Massarelli were entitled to an accounting of partnership
    profits accrued as at that date.  The appellants argue that these findings
    reflect a theory of liability that was neither pleaded nor addressed by the
    parties at trial.  Rather, they submit that it was introduced for the first
    time in the trial judge’s reasons for judgment, with the result that they
    were taken by surprise, prejudiced in their defence of the case, and denied
    the opportunity to know the case they had to meet.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    three reasons, I would reject these submissions.  First, in my view, the
    basis of liability articulated by the trial judge was encompassed by the
    pleadings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    their amended statement of claim, Husar and Massarelli did not allege that
    the partnership had been dissolved, by mutual agreement or otherwise, at
    any time.  To the contrary, as I have already indicated, they maintained
    in their pleading and throughout the trial that the partnership had never
    been terminated prior to Husar’s death.  Their claim for relief was based
    on the assertions that (i) the Property was acquired as partnership property
    for Husar and Marignani; (ii) the Property was transferred by Magnanelli
    to P
    &amp; M, at Marignani’s instigation, in January 1981; (iii) this transfer
    constituted a breach of trust and, accordingly, Marignani, P &amp; M and
    Magnanelli were “liable to account for all dealings with the Property” from
    the date of its acquisition in 1972; and (iv) Marignani and P &amp; M had
    breached their fiduciary duties to Husar and Massarelli in unspecified ways.  I
    note that Husar and Massarelli did not initially assert fraud against the
    appellants.  This claim was not made until the end of trial, when Husar and
    Massarelli were permitted to amend their pleading to include this allegation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the issue of whether the partnership was terminated by 1981, and the consequences
    thereof, if any, arose squarely on the appellants’ own pleading.  In their
    amended statement of defence, Marignani and P &amp; M did not dispute the
    existence of the partnership.  Nor did they deny that the Property was transferred
    to P &amp; M in January 1981.  Rather, as I have said, they denied any breach
    of trust or duty by them.  They alleged that Husar himself had breached the
    1972 Agreement and had abandoned the partnership by failing to contribute
    his share of the expenses of the development project as required by the 1972
    Agreement, thereby justifying the subsequent transfer of the Property to
    P &amp; M without compensation to Husar.  They also pleaded, essentially
    in the alternative, that if a valid contract was found to be in effect, “then
    there should be an accounting of the entire venture which gives value to
    the defendant Marignani’s work and his personal investment”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    on the case as pleaded, especially by the appellants, the termination of
    the partnership by 1981 – occasioned either by Marignani’s and P &amp; M’s
    alleged breach of trust and fiduciary duty, or by Husar’s alleged breach
    of the 1972 Agreement and abandonment of the partnership before the transfer
    of the Property to P &amp; M – was in issue.  Either theory, if accepted
    by the trial judge, could lead to a finding that the partnership was dissolved
    by January 1981.  In particular, the appellants’ amended pleading made this
    potential outcome a real possibility.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the remedy of an accounting was sought by both sides, albeit for the currency
    of the entire relationship between Husar and Marignani.  In support of this
    claimed relief, the parties joined issue in their pleadings on Husar’s and
    Marignani’s conduct in relation to the partnership, and its consequences. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is not a case, therefore, where the dissolution of the partnership by 1981
    was not on the parties’ ‘radar’ prior to trial.  If it was not, the pleadings
    dictated that it should have been.  From the close of pleadings, the appellants’ primary
    defence was that the partnership, in effect, ended by January 1981 due to
    Husar’s conduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the premise of the partnership’s termination by 1981 was also supported by
    Marignani’s evidence at trial.  He testified that Husar “[gave] up his share”
    in 1980 or 1981, and that “at that point” Husar “was no longer in” and “[gave]
    up his interest”.  Moreover, on discovery, Magnanelli said that when Husar
    told him “do what you want to do with the land”, Husar “want[ed] to give
    up his partnership”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    contrary to Marignani’s and P &amp; M’s contention before this court, the
    issue of the termination of the partnership in 1980 or 1981 – and the consequences
    thereof – was addressed by the parties in their final arguments at trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    sides filed written submissions with the trial judge at the conclusion of
    the trial.  In their submissions, Marignani and P &amp; M stressed that,
    because Husar “did not have the money to follow through with the [development]
    plan” for the Property, he left Marignani “on his own to carry on as he saw
    fit”, with the alleged result that “there was no partnership” and Marignani
    became the “sole beneficial owner of the lands” and “could in fact do what
    he wanted with the lands”.  They argued:   </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>[A]t some point in or around late 1980 or early
      1981, Joseph Husar abandoned [the Partnership] and ceased to have any involvement.</i>  After
      that point, Mr. Marignani no longer asked Husar to contribute to the costs
      and <i>acted upon the reasonable belief that the lands were his to do with
      as he saw fit</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
    further:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is the Defendants’ submission that <i>when Mr.
      Husar walked away from [the Partnership]</i> Mr. Magnanelli’s duties as
      trustee ceased.  <i>Once there was no partnership, Magnanelli… transferred
      the [Property] to its beneficial owner [P &amp; M]</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center;'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   It is therefore, the Defendants’ submission
    that <i>Mr. Marig-nani’s obligations are to be determined solely by the law
    of partnership as Mr. Marignani was never a trustee.  And, further, that</i> <i>the
    partnership, and hence, those duties and obligations, came to an end by late
    1980 or early 1981 as a result of the breach of the partnership agreement
    and/or abandonment thereof by Joseph Husar</i>, both expressly and impliedly.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    is apparent from these statements, at the end of trial the appellants maintained
    their position that the termination of the partnership in late 1980 or 1981
    and the alleged consequential termination of Marignani’s obligations to Husar
    fully justified (i) the transfer of the Property to P &amp; M without compensation
    to Husar, and (ii) the denial of any relief against the appellants.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants also urged the trial judge to apply the principles of partnership
    law, rather than the law of trusts, to the determination of the rights and
    obligations of the parties.  Upon the application of these principles, and
    on the appellants’ own theory of the case, it was open to the trial judge
    to determine whether the partnership had been dissolved and, if so, the manner
    and timing of its dissolution.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, in their original final submissions, Husar and Massarelli acknow-ledged,
    and attempted to counter, Marignani’s claim that the partnership had ended
    in 1980 or 1981.  Furthermore, in their written “reply final argument” at
    trial, Husar and Massarelli again addressed the proposition that the partnership
    ended in 1981, stating in part: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>But the simple fact is that even if [Husar] and
    [Marignani] did not come to an agreement as to changing the equal sharing
    of finances, then one has to ask did the partnership end.  If it did, assuming
    in 1981 or at any time thereafter, the result and obligations of the defendants
    would be the same.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the release of the trial judge’s reasons for judgment dated March 7, 2005,
    Marignani and P &amp; M maintained that they were taken by surprise and prejudiced
    by the trial judge’s findings that the partnership was dissolved in January
    1981 and that a duty to account arose as at that date.  In his reasons dated
    September 14, 2005 concerning his costs award, the trial judge addressed
    this claim directly:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[9]
          In the alternative, the defendants submit that although the plaintiffs
    were successful, they were unsuccessful in respect of the bulk of the claims
    advanced.  The judgment ultimately granted was awarded on a basis quite different
    from the plaintiffs’ major thrust at trial. …The defendants further take
    the position that the basis of my judgment, being that the partnership ended
    in 1981 and that it should be valued as at that date, was never advanced
    by the plaintiffs.  The defendants contend that they were not given an opportunity
    to make submissions on this point prior to judgment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later
    in the same reasons, the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>DEFENDANTS’
    ALLEGATION THAT THEY HAD NO
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE VALUE OF THE PARTNERSHIP AS AT [1981]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[28]
        The defendants have suggested that my finding that the partnership ended
    on January 30, [1981] and that there was a duty to account as of that date
    came as a surprise to them, that this possibility had never been raised by
    the plaintiffs or the court and that they had no opportunity to address it
    in final argument.  <i>This is not correct.  The defendants took the position
    that the plaintiffs abandoned their interest in or about 1981 and that it
    was valueless at that time.  In their final submissions the defendants addressed
    pre and post 1981 revenues and expenditures for the project in an attempt
    to show it had no value in 1981 and at the time of trial.  Although the possibility
    that the defendants had a duty to account to the plaintiffs for the value
    of the partnership as at January 1981 was not vigorously pursued by either
    party, it was always a possible outcome.  It had been raised in conferences
    I held with counsel in the course of trial and again prior to final submissions.  The
    plaintiffs addressed this possibility in their reply submissions.</i> [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[29]
        While there were no doubt strategic reasons for the plaintiffs and defendants
    making limited submissions on this point, the issue was always present and
    there was ample opportunity to address it in final submissions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tellingly,
    the appellants do not dispute the trial judge’s statements, quoted above,
    that the issue of the dissolution of the partnership and the potential consequences
    thereof were discussed in mid-trial conferences and, again, prior to final
    argument.  </p>

    all the circumstances, therefore, I conclude that the challenged findings
    of the trial judge arose directly from the appellants’
    own pleading and from the evidence and the final submissions of the parties
    at trial.  These factors distinguish this case from that category of cases,
    relied upon by Marignani and P &amp; M, in which the theory of liability
    ultimately relied upon by the trial judge was not pleaded or developed and
    addressed at trial: see for example, <i>Kalkinis (Litigation Guardian of)

    Forest pointed out that delay alone is insufficient to trigger laches.   As
    he explained at para. 98: “Rather, the doctrine considers whether the delay

    this case, the trial judge considered and rejected the appellants’ argument
    that Husar’s and Massarelli’s entitlement to an accounting was defeated by
    laches or acquies-cence.  He reasoned, in part, as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[58]
        Even if I were to find that Husar’s statement [that Marignani “should
    do what he want[ed]” with the Property reflected a decision to abandon his
    interest, <i>Husar did not have sufficient information regarding the financial
    situation of the partnership to have acted in a knowing manner.  Husar would
    have made the decision based on Marignani’s representation that the partnership
    had no value.  This representation by Marignani was not correct.</i>  In
    the circum-stances of this case it would be inequitable to allow Marig-nani,
    who stood in a fiduciary relationship to Husar, to acquire the partnership
    property at an undervalue thereby profiting from his erroneous statement
    as to the partnership’s value.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[87] <i>The present case is not one of unexplained
      delay by the plaintiffs.</i>  Husar would not be concerned with the continuing
      development of the land as he advised Marignani to do what he wanted with
      the land.  With respect to the failure to provide an accounting <i>Husar
      was advised repeatedly by Marignani that the development had not generated
      a profit.</i>  Husar trusted Marignani and likely accepted his statement.  Husar
      may well also have been concerned that if he challenged Marignani or insisted
      on an accounting he may be called upon to pay for the deficit that Marignani
      said had been run up by the partnership.  <i>There was no evidence led
      that in January 1981 or thereafter</i> <i>[that] Husar was provided with
      sufficient information to allow him to know or understand the financial
      situation of the project.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[89]
        I find that in the circumstances of this case <i>Husar was not aware

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    although the trial judge found in para. 58 and elsewhere in his reasons that
    Marignani represented to Husar that the partnership had “no value”, he also
    held throughout his reasons, including in para. 87 set out above, that Husar
    was “advised repeatedly by Marignani that the development had not generated
    a profit”.  In the trial judge’s view, these representations and the fact
    that, by January 1981, Husar was signif-icantly in arrears in making his
    contribution to the expenses of the partnership, explained why Husar did
    not seek an accounting from Marignani when the partnership was dissolved.  </p>

    appears that the trial judge regarded the “value”
    and the “profitability” of the partnership as interchangeable concepts in
    this case.  For example, in addition to his comments in paras. 58 and 87
    of his reasons, above-quoted, he also stated in para. 92:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[92]
        In the circumstances of this case I do not believe anything turns on
    the fact that the period for which an accounting was demanded was broader
    than the period for which they were entitled to an accounting.  <i>With respect
    to the delay in bringing the claim, it has been explained.</i>  The plaintiffs
    were not sophisticated businessmen and they considered Marignani to be a
    dependable, honest and knowledgeable manager of the project.  <i>Husar would
    not see the need to look behind his assurances to the effect that there had
    been no profit made.  Had Husar understood that the project may have had
    value and that he had a right to receive an accounting as of the date of
    transfer</i> <i>in January 1981, he likely would have insisted on it.</i>  [Emphasis

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Significantly,
    the trial judge expressly found that if Husar had understood in January 1981
    that “the project may have had value”, and that he had a right to an accounting,
    he “likely would have insisted on it”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, a representation that the partnership was not “profitable” as at
    January 1981 is not a representation that the partnership had “no value” at
    that date.  I agree with the appellants’ submission that the critical question
    was whether Husar knew or, viewed objectively, could have known upon reasonable
    inquiry that his partnership interest had some potential worth in 1981 and,
    hence, that he had a possible claim against Marignani when he triggered the
    dissolution of the partnership.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fact that Husar may not have known in January 1981, with certainty, whether
    he had a meritorious claim for an accounting against Marignani, or the amount
    of his claim, are not decisive of whether he knew or reasonably could have
    known that he had a potential claim against Marignani as at that date.  Awareness
    by Husar of a possible claim against Marignani did not require knowledge
    of whether the partnership was “profitable” in a technical or accounting
    sense.  Knowledge of the existence of a potential cause of action for an
    accounting is not predicated on knowledge of whether the accounting, if granted,
    will ultimately prove to be financially beneficial to the claimant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the trial judge’s findings as a whole, it seems clear that a reasonable person
    in  Husar’s position in January 1981 would have known that Husar’s interest
    in the part-nership had potential “value”.  The Property, a twenty-four acre
    parcel of land, was the partnership’s principal asset.  The trial judge found
    that Husar sold one-half of his interest in the Property to Massarelli in
    1974 for $57,500 –
    more than twice Husar’s total financial investment in the development project.  Husar
    was aware in early 1981 that Marignani had proceeded with the development
    of the Property, that building lots were available for sale, that some lots
    had been sold commencing in 1980 at a sale price of $15,000 per lot, and
    that Marignani had built houses on other lots for rental purposes.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    facts undercut the trial judge’s conclusions that Husar did not appreciate
    in 1981 that his partnership interest might have had
    “value”, that when Husar disassociated himself from the Partnership, he “did
    not have sufficient information regarding the financial situation of the
    partnership to have acted in a knowing manner,” and that Husar “was not aware
    of facts sufficient to lead a reasonable person to believe he had a possible
    claim”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    it appears to have been uncontested at trial that, prior to his request in
    1998 for an accounting, Husar never sought access to those records of the
    partnership as existed.  Specifically, there is no suggestion that he did
    so in 1981 when he divorced himself from the partnership.  In my view, it
    is not open to Husar to rely on an alleged lack of knowledge in 1981 of the
    financial affairs of the partnership as justification for his delay in advancing
    a claim against Marignani when, on reasonable diligence, information regarding
    the worth of his partnership interest in 1981 might have been forthcoming.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    and importantly, the trial judge held: “There was no evidence led that in
    January 1981 or thereafter [that] Husar was provided with sufficient information
    to allow him to know or understand the financial situation of the project.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
    Husar and Massarelli were the plaintiffs at trial.  They bore the evidentiary
    onus to establish that Husar lacked sufficient knowledge of the affairs of
    the partnership to appreciate that he was entitled to demand an accounting
    from his partner when he chose to terminate the partnership.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this record, it does not appear that any evidence was led at trial by Husar
    or Massarelli regarding Husar’s state of mind or the extent of his knowledge
    about the circumstances of the partnership when he precipitated the dissolution
    of the partnership.  Simply put, there was no evidence at trial from Husar
    and Massarelli to support the finding that Husar lacked the requisite knowledge
    in 1981, or at any time thereafter prior to 1998 when he first requested
    an accounting, to initiate a claim for an accounting against Marignani and
    P &amp; M.  Nor, as I have stated, was there evidence on behalf of Husar
    and Massarelli that Husar made inquiries about the financial status of the
    partnership or the development project when he told Marignani that he “should
    do what he want[ed]” with the Property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the trial judge accepted Massarelli’s evidence that Husar told him that the
    development project was advancing and that the “payout”
    would be when the project was completed.  Massarelli testified that Husar <i>repeatedly</i> told
    him, “When the subdivision is finished, whatever is half of whatever, that
    will be our bread and butter” and “whenever we finish, whatever, the profit
    will come after”.  Massarelli’s evidence of these state-ments by Husar, at
    least some of which appear to have been made after 1981, does not support
    the contention that Husar believed the partnership to be valueless, or that
    he was unaware that he had a claim against Marignani in respect of the development
    project.  To the contrary, they suggest that Husar was waiting deliberately
    until the development of the Property was complete before seeking a “payout”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    these defects in the trial judge’s reasoning, the issue is whether his holding
    that laches did not apply to bar recovery by Husar of a share of the partnership
    profits as at the date of the partnership dissolution, is sustainable.  Respectfully,
    I conclude that it is not.  I say this for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no dispute that laches can operate as a complete bar to relief in equity.  In
    R. C. I’Anson Banks, ed. <i>Lindley &amp; Banks on Partnership</i>, 18<sup>th</sup> ed.
    (
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2002) at 23-18 and 23-20, the author states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   A partner may, on normal principles, be precluded
    from obtaining equitable relief by reason of laches or acquiescence.  <i>Laches…presupposes
    not only the passage of time, but also the existence of circumstances which
    render it inequitable to afford a claimant the relief which he seeks</i>.  Similarly
    in the case of acquiescence.  [Footnotes omitted and emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center;'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   Questions of laches and/or acquiescence frequently
    arise where a person has agreed to enter into partnership but has, in effect,
    hung back in order to see whether participation in the venture is worthwhile.  Lord
    Lindley explained: </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>“<u>The doctrine of laches is of great importance
      where persons have agreed to become partners, and one of them has unfairly
      left the other to do all the work, and then, there being a profit, comes
      forward and claims a share of it.</u>  In such cases as these, the [<i>claimant’s</i>]
      conduct lays him open to the remark that nothing would have been heard
      of him had the joint adventure ended in loss instead of gain; and a court
      will not aid those who can be shown to have remained quiet in the hope
      of being able to evade responsibility in case of loss, but of being able
      to claim a share of gain in case of ultimate success.”</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>[Italicized emphasis in original, underlining
    added and footnotes omitted.] </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge was alive to these principles.  He indicated in his reasons that
    if he had not found that the partnership had ended in 1981, “laches may well
    have applied to bar the plaintiff from recovering any profits made by the
    defendants after 1981”, given the alteration by Marignani thereafter of his
    position in respect of the partnership and Husar’s delay in raising any objection
    to Marignani’s actions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the trial judge also concluded that: “The situation respecting profits accrued
    by January 30, 1981 is, however, quite different.”  He based this conclusion
    on two factors: first, on his view that this was not a case of “unexplained
    delay”
    by Husar and Massarelli, for the reasons set out in para. 87 of his reasons
    for judgment, quoted in para. 47 of these reasons.  I take this finding by
    the trial judge to mean that Husar’s delay was reasonable in the circumstances.  Second,
    the trial judge relied on the fact that Husar remained liable for his share
    of partnership expenses until January 1981, with the result that it was open
    to Marignani until that date to hold Husar to his financial obligations and
    his potential liability under the 1972 Agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have already concluded that the trial judge’s reasoning in support of his
    holding that this was not a case of “unexplained delay” was flawed.  In my
    opinion, Husar’s delay in advancing a claim in respect of the partnership
    was unreasonable.  The following factors compel this conclusion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the trial judge implicitly held in his reasons for judgment dated March 7,
    2005 that Husar’s and Massarelli’s cause of action arose on January 30, 1981
    when the partnership was dissolved.  In his reasons dated May 13, 2005 concerning
    prejudgment interest, the trial judge expressly stated his view that a cause
    of action arose and that Marignani had a fiduciary duty to account to Husar
    as at January 30, 1981.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    holding was based on the trial judge’s finding that Husar had agreed to the
    dissolution of the partnership by January 1981.  Indeed, on the trial judge’s
    findings, Husar’s own actions precipitated the breakup of the partnership
    at a time when he was indebted to Marignani for his share of the expenses
    of the partnership that exceeded $26,600.  The trial judge also found that
    Husar knew that he was not Marignani’s partner after January 1981 but that
    he made no demand for an accounting of partnership assets until 1998.  To
    the contrary, when the ownership of the Property passed to P &amp; M, Husar
    essentially stood by, knowing that his interest in the Property was being
    transferred, and yet did nothing.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the trial judge also held that no fraud had been established at trial against
    Marignani or P &amp; M.  He found that Marignani acted under the honest belief
    that the partnership had ended in 1981, that it had not been “profitable”
    and that he owed nothing to Husar.  The trial judge thus rejected Husar’s
    and Massarelli’s contentions that Marignani acted fraudulently, dishonestly,
    or with any intent to mislead.  In his reasons dated September 14, 2005,
    the trial judge confirmed his finding that Marignani did not act in bad faith.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    Husar made a relatively small financial investment in the partnership from
    which he substantially profited within about two years of the formation of
    the partner-ship, by selling one-half of his partnership interest to Massarelli
    for more than twice his initial investment.  He kept these sale proceeds
    for his own use, and neither sought nor obtained Marignani’s consent to the
    conveyance to Massarelli.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    in contrast to Husar’s minor financial investment, Marignani alone paid for
    and developed the Property prior to and after 1981, investing funds for that
    purpose with Husar’s knowledge and without his assistance.  At a time when
    it was clear that Husar was either unable or unwilling to contribute his
    share of the expenses of the partnership, as he was obliged to do, Husar
    simply walked away from the partnership, leaving Marignani with the sole
    responsibility to complete the development of the Property, at an eventual
    cost that the trial judge described as in the “millions”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifth,
    Husar took no action to settle the accounts of the partnership for eighteen
    years although, as I have already stated, he knew or upon reasonable inquiry
    could have known that his interest in the partnership potentially had “value” in
    1981.  He repeatedly told Massarelli, apparently before and after 1981, that
    the “payout”
    would occur when the development of the Property was complete.  He then waited
    for almost two decades before demanding an accounting.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the end, Husar, a real estate agent of some experience, stood by while Marig-nani
    expended most of the funds required for the development of the Property,
    Phase I of which was well underway by 1981.  He allowed Marignani to bear
    all the risk and to assume sole financial responsibility for the development,
    including for that part of the project carried out by 1981.  He took virtually
    no steps to become engaged in or to advance the interests of the partnership.  He
    took no action to seek redress against Marignani until he requested an accounting
    in 1998 and commenced legal proceedings in 1999.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    these facts, I am compelled to conclude that while Husar’s delay, by itself,
    did not trigger the application of laches, his entire course of conduct rendered
    the prosecution in 1999 of an action for equitable relief unreasonable and
    unjust.  To paraphrase <i>Lindley’s</i> words, above-quoted, nothing would
    have been heard from Husar had the joint adventure ended in loss instead
    of gain.  This case is precisely the type of situation in which the courts
    will avoid injustice by declining to grant equitable relief on the basis
    of the claimant’s conduct, including unreasonable delay, and the lapse of
    time.  Accordingly, in my view, laches applies to defeat Husar’s claims against
    the appellants.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Necessarily,
    Massarelli’s claims against the appellants must also fail.  The trial judge
    found that Massarelli was not Marignani’s partner, that Marignani was entitled
    to deal exclusively with Husar, that Husar’s actions and representations
    to Marignani bound Massarelli, and that Husar and Massarelli were equal partners
    in respect of Husar’s half interest in the partnership.  These findings are
    not challenged by Massarelli, who acknowledged before this court that Husar’s
    conduct was binding on him.  As a result, whatever remedies may otherwise
    be available to Massarelli, if any, his action against the appellants must
    be dismissed.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    I have concluded that Husar’s and Massarelli’s action fails on the basis
    of laches, it is unnecessary to address the remaining grounds of appeal raised

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

    the issues on the cross-appeal depend on the success of Husar’s and Massarelli’s
    action, which I conclude must be dismissed, the issues raised on the cross-appeal
    are moot.  I note that, as a result, these reasons do not address the issue
