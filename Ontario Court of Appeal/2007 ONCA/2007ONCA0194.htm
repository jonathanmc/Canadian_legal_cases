  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his conviction for sexual assault on
    August 2, 2005 by the Honourable Mr. Justice Fournier, sitting without a jury,
    at Haileybury, Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant (K.F.), who was fifteen years old at the time
    of the offence and sixteen at trial, alleges that, after a party held by her parents
    for her brother’s birthday, the appellant performed oral sex on her and briefly
    penetrated her without her consent. The appellant was self-represented at
    trial. He denied that any sexual activity had taken place between him and K.F.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On this appeal, the appellant raises numerous grounds of
    appeal. For the reasons that follow, I would not give effect to the majority of
    these. However, I do agree that the trial judge erred when he failed to put the
    appellant to his election under s. 536(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. For this reason, a new trial is required.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt;'>THE
    FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 12, 2004 – the day of the alleged offence – the
    appellant, K.F., K.F.’s older sister (A.F.), and other family and friends
    gathered at K.F.’s parents’ home for a birthday party for K.F.’s older brother.
    Until shortly before this date, the appellant had been involved in a
    relationship with A.F. The appellant had not been invited to the party, but
    showed up in an apparent effort to reconcile with A.F. While his attendance was
    not welcomed, the family appeared to tolerate it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the evidence at trial, the appellant made a number of
    efforts to speak to A.F. during the party, but on each occasion she walked away
    from him. Eventually A.F. left the party altogether.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>K.F. arrived at the party at approximately 10:00 p.m., after
    having worked her shift at Kentucky Fried Chicken.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While there was some conflict in the evidence at trial about
    how much K.F. had to drink at the party, the preponderance of the evidence
    suggests that she had very little, if anything, to drink. However, with the
    exception of K.F. and her father, there is little doubt that almost everyone
    else at the party had a lot to drink that night.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the party wound down, someone had placed a pillow and a
    blanket on the couch in the living room where it was intended that the
    appellant would sleep. K.F. had for some time been sleeping on a mattress on
    the floor in that same room; her bedroom was undergoing renovations at the
    time. K.F.’s aunt also slept on a love-seat in the living room for part of the
    night. K.F.’s parents slept approximately twenty-five feet down the hall from
    the living room.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to K.F., after everyone else had gone to bed, the
    appellant, who had been on the couch, stood at the end of her mattress. She
    asked him what he wanted, but he did not answer. The appellant pulled off
    K.F.’s blanket and pulled her pants down. He then performed oral sex on her and
    briefly penetrated her with his penis. The appellant then asked K.F. “what are
    you going to do for me?”  K.F. made no
    sounds and did not resist or complain during the assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Soon after the alleged assault, K.F. says that she went to the
    bathroom, where she cried for about five minutes. She then returned to the
    living room and angrily told the appellant to get out of her bed. He refused.
    K.F. went to sleep on the couch.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant did not report this assault to the police
    until January 2005, after talking to some friends. She says that she did not
    come forward earlier because she was afraid, embarrassed, and worried that her
    parents would not believe her. After the incident, she never smiled; she became
    depressed and moody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the appellant admits that he went to sleep on K.F.’s
    mattress and that he would not get off her mattress when asked, he denies that
    he assaulted K.F. He denies that any sexual activity took place between them.</p>

    failure to put the appellant to his election under s. 536(2) of the <i>Criminal Codeof Canada</i></u>?<i></i></span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 536(2) of the <i>Code </i>provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>If an accused is before a justice
    charged with an indictable offence, other than an offence listed in section
    469, and the offence is not one over which a provincial court judge has
    absolute jurisdiction under section 553, the justice shall, after the
    information has been read to the accused, put the accused to an election in the
    following words:</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>You have the option to elect to be
    tried by a provincial court judge without a jury and without having had a
    preliminary inquiry; or you may elect to be tried by a judge without a jury; or
    you may elect to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury. If you do
    not elect now, you are deemed to have elected to be tried by a court composed
    of a judge and jury. If you elect to be tried by a judge without a jury or by a
    court composed of a judge and jury or if you are deemed to have elected to be tried
    by a court composed of a judge and jury, you will have a preliminary inquiry
    only if you or the prosecutor requests one. How do you elect to be tried?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is clear from the record that the language of s. 536(2) was
    not put to the appellant. The only question that remains is whether what was
    said amounts to substantial compliance with the section. It is the appellant’s
    position that there was neither substantial compliance with s. 536(2) nor
    effective waiver of the requirements of that section. In such circumstances,
    the appellant says, the provincial court judge was without jurisdiction to try
    him. The appellant relies on <i>R. v.
    Mitchell</i> (1997), 121 C.C.C. (3d) 139 (Ont. C.A.) where at para. 28 Doherty
    J.A. stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>If an accused has an election as to
    the mode of trial, that election should be put to the accused in the language
    of s. 536(2). Absent waiver of the procedural requirements of that section, a
    failure to put the accused to his or her election, in terms which at least
    substantially comply with the section is a procedural error resulting in a loss
    of jurisdiction to conduct either a trial or a preliminary inquiry[.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Doherty J.A. further concluded at para. 29 that the court
    could not use s.&nbsp;686(1)(b)(iv) to cure a failure to put an accused to his
    election. He reasoned:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>By its terms,
    [s. 686(1)(b)(iv)] can reach only procedural errors committed by a court having
    “jurisdiction over the class of offence” for which the accused was convicted. A
    judge of the Provincial Division has no jurisdiction to try an electable
    indictable offence unless an accused has made an effective election for trial
    in that court. As Griffiths J.A. said, in <i>R.
    v. Pottinger </i> (1990), 54 C.C.C. (3d)
    246 (Ont. C.A.) at 252:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>The complete
    want of jurisdiction to conduct the trial is not the kind of procedural
    irregularity which … should be cured by invoking s. 686(1)(b)(iv).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Doherty J.A. went on in para. 30 to consider the question of
    waiver:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Unless there was
    an effective waiver of the procedural requirements of s. 536(2), the trial was
    a nullity and the appeal must succeed. Section 536(2) was enacted to assist an
    accused in making an informed decision as to mode of trial. An accused may
    personally, or through counsel, waive compliance with a procedure like s.
    536(2) which has been enacted for the protection of the accused: <i>Korponey v. Attorney General of Canada</i> (1982), 65 C.C.C. (2d) 65 (S.C.C.) at 73. In <i>Korponey</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p.
    74, a case involving waiver of procedural rights surround a re-election, Lamer
    J., for the unanimous court, described the elements of an effective waiver of a
    procedural right in these words:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>…[T]he
    validity of such a waiver, and I should add that that is so of any waiver, is
    dependent upon it being <i>clear and
    unequivocal that the person is waiving the procedural safeguard and is doing so
    with full knowledge of the rights the procedure was enacted to protect and of
    the effect the waiver will have on those rights in the process.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>After indicating
    that the effectiveness of a waiver required a fact-specific inquiry, Lamer J.
    added, at p. 74:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>However,
    always relevant will be the fact that the accused is or is not represented by
    counsel, counsel’s experience, and, in my view of great importance in a country
    so varied as ours, the particular practice that has developed in the jurisdiction
    where the events are taking place.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To begin the factual inquiry to determine whether there has
    been substantial compliance with section s. 536(2), one must look to the
    record. In this case, the relevant portions  of the record provide as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>CLERK OF THE COURT:            Joey
    Varcoe, you are charged that on or about the 12<sup>th</sup> day of September,
    2004 at the Town of Cobalt in the said region, did commit a sexual assault on
    [K.F.], contrary to s. 271 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>. How does the Crown elect to proceed?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>MS. REGIMBAL:            As
    indicated on the screening form, the Crown is proceeding by way of indictment
    on the charge. Your Honour, I did take a few moments and explain to Mr. Varcoe
    that the nature of the charge and election means that he has the option to choose
    whether or not he wishes to proceed to Superior Court or to have his trial here
    today. Verbally, he indicated his wish was to have his trial here today and get
    it over with, but perhaps the court can take a moment to explain that option to
    him. He did indicate this was for trial today. And the Crown has made up its
    witness list accordingly.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>THE COURT:                        Okay. Thank you. That is the case,
    sir. You know that you could elect to proceed by way of judge and jury, or a
    judge of Superior Court alone or this court, and you prefer to proceed in this
    court here today.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>JOEY VARCOE:            Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>THE COURT:                        Okay. So that will be your election
    as noted. And I gather you are entering a plea of not guilty.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>JOEY VARCOE:            Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>THE COURT:                        Okay. Can I see the information
    briefly?  You may proceed, Crown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The difficulty here is that the record says nothing about a
    preliminary inquiry. We do not know if the Crown, in her discussions with the
    appellant, gave him any explanation at all in relation to a preliminary
    inquiry.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We have no information, and certainly nothing on the record,
    to suggest whether the appellant even knew what a preliminary inquiry was, let
    alone his entitlement to one. We can make no assumptions about his knowledge of
    the criminal process. His criminal record tells us nothing about his knowledge
    of the criminal process such that we can assume he was aware of his right to a
    preliminary inquiry. It may be that he entered guilty pleas on those other
    occasions. We simply do not know, and the record is insufficient to enable this
    court to make any such assumption.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While in recent times there has been discussion about the
    possibility of eliminating preliminary inquiries from the criminal justice
    process, today they remain an integral part thereof.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In these circumstances, I am of the view that there was no
    jurisdiction for the trial judge to proceed with the appellant’s trial, and on
    this ground alone there must be a new trial. Because there must be a new trial.
    I propose to deal with the other grounds of appeal raised only very briefly.</p>

'><b><u>Did the trial judge err in not
    appointing counsel on behalf of the appellant
    under s. 486(2.3) of the <i>Criminal Code?</i></u></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant was under eighteen years of age at the time of
    trial. Section 486(2.3) provided:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In proceedings
    referred to in subsection (1.1), the accused shall not personally cross-examine
    a witness who at the time of the proceedings is under the age of eighteen
    years, unless the presiding judge, provincial court judge or justice is of the
    opinion that the proper administration of justice requires the accused to
    personally conduct the cross-examination, and if the accused is not personally
    conducting the cross-examination, the presiding judge, provincial court judge
    or justice shall appoint counsel for the purpose of conducting the
    cross-examination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the manner in which section 486(2.3) was considered by
    the trial judge was less than satisfactory, I am of the view that no
    substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred in the circumstances of
    this case as a result of his failure to appoint counsel. The complainant was
    sixteen years of age at the time of trial and consented to the appellant
    personally cross-examining her. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is a fine line that trial judges are required to walk in
    dealing with unrepresented and self-represented accused persons. Trial judges
    are to avoid any conduct that may be seen to favour one side over the other and
    to maintain their independence as between the two. This obligation must be
    balanced against the need to take steps to ensure that no miscarriage of
    justice occurs as a result of an unrepresented accused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal stated in <i>R. v. Phillips </i>(2003), 172 C.C.C. (3d)
    285 at paras. 22-23, aff’d (2003), 181 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.) with respect to
    unrepresented accused persons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Their need for
    guidance varies depending on the crime, the facts, the defences raised and the
    accused’s sophistication. The judge’s advice must be interactive, tailored to
    the circumstances of the offence and the offender, with appropriate instruction
    at each stage of the trial.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>How far a trial
    judge should go in assisting an accused is therefore a matter of judicial
    discretion[.] The overriding duty is to ensure that the unrepresented accused
    has a fair trial. [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While this judge certainly could have been of more assistance
    to the appellant, in my view the appellant had a fair trial overall. This was a
    short and uncomplicated trial. The appellant was aware that it was important
    for him to discredit K.F.’s version of the events and he tried to do so,
    although perhaps not as effectively as counsel on his behalf might have done.
    For example, he led evidence about his relationships with other women and his
    lack of sexual aggressiveness in those other relationships. Further, he
    testified on his own behalf that his feelings for K.F.’s sister made his
    actions against K.F. unlikely.</p>

line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The test to establish reasonable apprehension of bias is “what
    would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically –
    and having thought the matter through – conclude”: see <i>R. v. S. </i>(<i>R.D.</i>) (1997),
    118 C.C.C. (3d) 353 at para. 31 (S.C.C.).  The onus is on the person alleging bias and the threshold for finding
    its existence is high.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the appellant has not established that the trial
    judge’s conduct gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. Much of this
    complaint relates to the trial judge’s comments to K.F. – comments I would
    consider to be perhaps a somewhat overzealous effort to put her at ease. I do
    not see these comments as giving rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. </p>

    admissible and may be used to support a complainant’s evidence of a sexual
    assault. See <i>R. v. Boss</i> (1988), 46
    C.C.C. (3d) 523 (Ont. C.A.). The weight to be given this properly admissible
