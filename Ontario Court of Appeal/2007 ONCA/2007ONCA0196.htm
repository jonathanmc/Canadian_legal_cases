    appellant was convicted of first degree murder and received the mandatory
    sentence of life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for twenty-five
    years.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant appeals his conviction.  He
    submits that this court should receive certain “fresh” evidence which he argues
    entitles him to a new trial.  Alternatively, if the court rejects the “fresh” evidence, the appellant
    submits that errors in the trial vitiate the verdict and require an order
    directing a new trial.  He argues that
    the trial judge erred in excluding certain exculpatory statements made by him
    to an undercover officer and that there were material errors in the charge to
    the jury.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    evidence tendered on appeal should not be admitted.  That evidence was readily available at trial and was not made
    known by the appellant to his counsel because the appellant decided that it was
    not in his best interest to lead the evidence at trial.  In the totality of the circumstances, the
    interests of justice are not served by allowing the appellant to secure a new
    trial by advancing evidence on appeal that he chose not to produce to his
    lawyer prior to trial.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    would give effect to one of the other grounds of appeal.  The trial judge did not review the evidence
    and relate it to the respective positions of the parties on the issue of
    planning and deliberation.  That
    non-direction constitutes reversible error in the circumstances of this case.  That error could not, however, have affected
    the jury’s determination that the appellant murdered the victim.  While a conviction for first degree murder
    is available on the evidence, the Crown does not seek a new trial on that
    charge if the court is prepared to substitute a conviction on a charge of
    second degree murder.  I would
    substitute a conviction for second degree murder.    </span></p>

    June 2, 1999, Emel Silva was murdered in a pool hall on St. Clair Avenue in
    Toronto.  Silva was shot seven times,
    probably with one gun, but possibly with two.  Three shots struck Silva in the head, three shots hit him in the arm and
    one shot entered his back.  Silva was
    shot within ten minutes of entering the pool hall.  Based on evidence of blood loss, it is likely that the first shot
    hit Silva in the back.  That shot would not
    have caused Silva to die immediately.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    at the scene of the murder yielded nothing of forensic value save two telephone
    numbers found in the deceased’s possession that were linked to Arnaldo
    Maciel  (also referred to as Renaldo and
    Rolando), the appellant’s father.  The
    police could not find any witnesses to the shooting, although it appeared that
    other individuals were in the pool hall when the shots were fired.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Crown’s case against the appellant rested on two evidentiary pillars: the
    evidence of Socorro Rivera, Silva’s mother, and evidence of intercepted private
    communications.  Ms. Rivera testified to
    discussions she had with her son the day before he was killed and the day he
    was killed.  On consent, this evidence
    was admitted for the truth of the contents of the statements made by Silva
    insofar as those statements referred to past events.  Ms. Rivera also testified to certain events on the day her son
    was murdered and a conversation she had with him immediately before he went
    into the pool hall.  This conversation
    was admitted as evidence of Silva’s intention.  The trial judge’s instruction on this evidence is in issue on the
    appeal.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    late July 1999, an undercover police officer approached various friends and
    associates of the appellant.  He
    identified himself as Silva’s cousin, who had been sent by the Colombians from
    New York to find out who killed Silva and to collect an outstanding debt.  The undercover officer and two large
    associates posed as gangsters and acted in a threatening manner in the hope
    that their actions would precipitate conversations involving the appellant and
    his friends that would shed light on Silva’s murder.  Discussions involving the undercover officer, the appellant,
    members of his family and associates of the appellant were intercepted by the
    police between late July and mid-September 1999.  These interceptions were made pursuant to judicial
    authorizations.    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    Crown introduced evidence of several intercepted communications.  Two intercepts, referred to at trial as
    intercepts 74 and 75, were crucial to the Crown’s case against the
    appellant.  The trial judge told the
    jury it must acquit unless it was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the
    appellant was talking about Silva’s murder in either or both conversations.</span></p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>            (a)  The evidence of Ms. Rivera</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    Rivera testified that the night before Silva was killed, he told her that about
    a week earlier he had been confronted by two Colombians from New York and a
    third person he described as a Dominican.  Silva knew the Dominican.  Silva
    told his mother that the Colombians indicated to him that two Portuguese
    friends of his owed the Colombians money.  The Portuguese were identified as a father named Rolando and his son
    Ricky.  The Colombians told Silva that
    he was responsible for collecting the debt owed by the Portuguese to the
    Colombians.  Silva was told that he
    would be in personal danger if he did not collect the money.  He did not explain to his mother why the
    Colombians held him responsible for collecting the debt.  Silva had, however, recently returned from
    Colombia where he lived for a short time.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    told his mother that after he spoke to the Colombians, he met with Rolando and
    Ricky and told them about the Colombians’ demands.  Silva tried to arrange a meeting between Rolando, Ricky and the
    Colombians.  The Colombians wanted to
    meet at a location of their choice, and Rolando insisted that the meeting be
    held at a pool hall on St. Clair Avenue.  That pool hall, which is where Silva was murdered on June 2, was owned
    by a good friend of Rolando and Ricky.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    Rivera testified that she was with her son on the day he was murdered.  He spent a good deal of time on the
    telephone trying to arrange a meeting between Rolando and Ricky and the
    Colombians.  She testified that the
    Colombians told Silva they would not meet at the pool hall on St. Clair Avenue,
    but that Rolando was adamant that the meeting must be held at the pool
    hall.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    Rivera arrived at the pool hall with her son at about 5:35 p.m.  He told her he was going to meet with
    Rolando and Ricky and possibly with the Colombians.  In cross-examination, she agreed that she told the police her son
    mentioned meeting with only Rolando.  Silva was nervous about the meeting and left his driver’s licence with
    his mother when he went inside the pool hall.  He told her he did not want anybody inside the pool hall to know where
    he lived.  Silva told his mother that he
    thought he would be out shortly.  Ms.
    Rivera fell asleep and the next thing she knew a police officer woke her up and
    told her that someone had been killed.  Silva was shot shortly before 5:45 p.m.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
    trial, the Crown argued that Silva had found himself in the middle of a dispute
    over a debt owed by the appellant and his father to a sinister group referred
    to as the Colombians.  The Crown
    theorized that the appellant, acting alone or in concert with his father, lured
    Silva to the pool hall where the appellant could act without fear that anyone
    would cooperate with police, and shot Silva.  According to the Crown, the appellant murdered Silva to sever the link
    between the appellant and his father and the debt to the Colombians.  The Crown also suggested, based on a comment
    made by the appellant in one of the intercepted communications, that the appellant
    wanted to take over Silva’s business for his father.  The exact nature of that business was not disclosed by the
    evidence.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    defence argued that Ms. Rivera’s evidence did not support the Crown’s
    theory.  The defence contended that if
    there was a debt owed by the appellant and his father to the Colombians, it was
    essential that they keep Silva alive as a buffer in their dealings with the
    dangerous Colombians.  The defence
    argued that it made no sense for the appellant to kill Silva as that would only
    cause the Colombians to come after him and his father directly.  The defence also submitted that there was no
    evidence that Silva operated any business, much less a business that the
    appellant would be interested in taking over for his father.  Finally, it was the defence position that on
    Ms. Rivera’s evidence, her son was friendly with the appellant and his father,
    and the only threats made against him came from the Colombians.  </span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It is
    only necessary to review the contents of the two crucial conversations relied
    on by the Crown.  The first
    conversation, intercept 74, occurred in the early afternoon of September 2,
    1999 and was intercepted by a car probe installed in the appellant’s
    vehicle.  The appellant, his father, and
    three friends were driving to a meeting with Arthur Amaral, another friend of
    the appellant, and his father.  Amaral
    had spoken to the undercover officer about forty-five minutes earlier.  The officer had terminated that conversation
    with Amaral in a threatening way, telling him that he wanted a meeting with the
    two people he considered responsible for his cousin’s death.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the
    first part of intercept 74, the persons in the car are speaking about Silva’s
    murder and the phone calls being made by the undercover officer demanding
    information concerning Silva’s death.  There is some discussion about the best way to deal with Silva’s
    “cousin” and his demands.  After these
    comments, the appellant’s father and two of the other occupants left the car to
    go into a restaurant to meet with Mr. Amaral.  The appellant remained in the vehicle with one other individual.  In the course of the ensuing conversation,
    the appellant made statements which the Crown alleged referred to Silva’s
    murder.  In particular, the Crown
    alleged that the appellant said:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>Because at the time of the shooting
    I - I was fucked up in the head …  what

    his business.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Crown argued that placed in the context of the earlier part of the
    conversation, it could be inferred that the appellant was referring to the
    shooting of Silva.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    defence took the position that so much of intercept 74 was inaudible,
    incomplete and out-of-context that no meaning could safely be ascribed to the
    bits of the conversation that could be heard.  The defence also contended that material parts of the transcript were
    inaccurate.  Finally, the defence argued
    that there was nothing in the words that could actually be heard on the
    recording that supported the contention that the appellant was referring to
    Silva’s murder when he talked about “the shooting”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Intercept
    75 occurred on September 9, using the car probe installed in the appellant’s
    vehicle.  In the course of this
    conversation with a friend, the appellant acknowledged that he “piped shells”
    into someone who did not “die instantly”. The appellant referred to the person
    who had been shot as a person who had “used to be like this big tough guy
    around but he wasn’t no more after he was dead”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
    with intercept 74, the Crown argued that placed in the context of the entirety
    of the conversation, other surrounding conversations, and the appellant’s
    ongoing concern about Silva’s “cousin”, the jury should infer that the
    appellant was speaking to his friend about Silva’s murder.  The Crown argued that certain parts of the
    description provided by the appellant were consistent with the facts
    surrounding Silva’s murder.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    defence challenged intercept 75 in much the same way as it had challenged intercept
    74.  It contended that because so much
    of it was inaudible, no reliance could be placed on the words that could be
    heard.  The defence also argued that
    significant parts of the transcript relied on by the Crown were
    inaccurate.  In particular, the defence
    argued that the transcript omitted the appellant’s reference to the person who
    had been killed as a “bouncer”.  There
    was no evidence that Silva had ever been so employed.  The defence also mentioned that certain comments made by the
    appellant in intercept 75 referred to facts that were inconsistent with the
    known facts surrounding Silva’s murder.  </span></p>

    for the jury to decide what was said by the appellant in intercepts 74 and 75

    had decided he wanted to obtain Mr. Camara’s interest in a restaurant.  The appellant had visited the restaurant and
    been impressed with the renovations.  Mr. Camara’s partner was unhappy with the partnership.  The appellant was looking for something for
    his father to do when his father got out of jail after completing his sentence
    on a conviction for trafficking in narcotics.  Although the appellant’s father was a construction worker and had not
    previously worked in the restaurant business, the appellant thought that his
    father would enjoy managing a restaurant.  </span></p>

    trial lawyer about the shooting of Mr. Camara, his lawyer would feel compelled
    to lead that evidence at trial regardless of the appellant’s instructions to

    and told him that he could not recall what he was talking about in intercepts
    74 and 75, he did embrace counsel’s theory that the references were to another
    shooting.  He pointed out passages in

    have learned that the appellant made his living as a drug dealer and that his

    Campbell refers to the profound effect of the verdict on the appellant’s
    liberty.  He stands condemned to life
    imprisonment.  Mr. Campbell submits that
    as the negative impact of a verdict on an accused’s liberty interest increases,
    concerns about the factual correctness of that verdict should also increase. He
    argues that finality concerns, while always relevant, take on less significance
    in cases where the verdict effects an ongoing and total deprivation of the
    appellant’s liberty.  </span></p>

    and I think most importantly, Mr. Campbell submits that the evidence placed

    much in doubt.  He contends that it
    cannot be in the interests of justice to allow a guilty verdict to stand and
    incarceration to continue where evidence is placed before this court that
    offers a compelling case that the verdict is factually wrong.  Mr. Campbell eloquently argues that both the

    resistance to attempts to undo tactical decisions made at trial through “fresh”

    the cases referred to above demonstrate the potential importance of a tactical
    decision made at trial on an application to adduce evidence on appeal, some of
    those cases also support Mr. Campbell’s contention that the explanation for the
    tactical decision is an important consideration.  For example, where the “fresh” evidence offered on appeal is
    evidence that the accused suffered from a mental disorder at the time of the
    offence, and there is evidence that the accused suffered from that disorder at
    the time of trial, appellate courts have tended to discount the significance of
    the decision not to lead evidence of a mental disorder at trial:  see <i>Re
    Regina v. Gorecki</i>, <i>supra</i>;  <i>R. v.
    Warsing</i>, <i>supra</i>;  <i>R. v.
    M.(I.E.)</i> (2003), 173 C.C.C. (3d) 515 at para. 45 (Ont. C.A.).  Similarly, a decision not to pursue certain
    evidence at trial will be given less weight on an application to adduce that
    same evidence on appeal where the state of the law at the time of the trial was
    such that the relevance of the evidence to a fact in issue was not as clear as
    it was by the time of the appeal:  see <i>McMartin v. The Queen</i>, [1965] 1 C.C.C.
    142 at 149-50 (S.C.C.).  </span></p>

    immaturity of an accused may explain why he or she did not disclose certain
    information to counsel and may diminish the significance of the failure to
    adduce that evidence at trial.  However,
    an accused’s youth, standing alone, is not enough.  There is nothing in this record to suggest that the appellant’s
    age (almost 23) should mitigate the effect of his decision not to tell Mr.
    Bloomenfeld about the evidence he now seeks to adduce before this court.  The appellant was a young man, but he was
    far from a naïve, diffident youngster unaccustomed to making his own
    significant and important decisions.  To
    the contrary, despite his youth, the proffered evidence demonstrates that the
    appellant was well into a life of serious crime in which he was operating as an
    adult and making significant life-altering decisions.  Mr. Bloomenfeld described the appellant as “bright, articulate
    and independent minded”.  His
    involvement in the preparation and presentation of his defence fully justifies
    Mr. Bloomenfeld’s assessment.  The
    appellant made a calculated, tactical decision as to how best to present his
    defence at trial.  His age provides no
    reason for discounting the significance of that decision when deciding whether
    to admit the evidence proffered on appeal.</span></p>

    agree that the second factor identified by Mr. Campbell should be taken into
    account in deciding what weight to give to the failure to lead evidence at
    trial.  Although the seriousness of the
    consequence of rejecting evidence proffered on appeal has not been referred to
    in any of the case law, it is well recognized that the due diligence analysis
    must be “context sensitive” and consider the totality of the circumstances,
    including the nature of the proceedings:  <i>R. v. 1275729 Ontario Inc.</i>,
    [2005] O.J. No. 5515 at para. 29 (C.A.).  A judicial discretion that must be exercised “in the interests of
    justice” cannot ignore the practical consequences that will flow depending on
    how the discretion is exercised.  It is
    one thing to reject “fresh” evidence on appeal in the name of finality where
    that rejection means that the defendant remains convicted of a regulatory
    offence for which he was required to pay a fine, but quite another thing to
    reject evidence of the same cogency based on the finality principle where that
    rejection means that the appellant will remain convicted of murder and
    sentenced to life imprisonment.  </span></p>

    severe consequences to the appellant flowing from his conviction dictate that

    determining factor identified by Mr. Campbell. </span></p>

    are at least three discernible markers on the cogency continuum.  At one extreme is evidence that satisfies
    the court of appeal that the appellant is innocent.  Next on the continuum is evidence that, when considered with the
    evidence adduced at trial, satisfies the court of appeal that no reasonable
    jury could convict.  If the new evidence
    reaches this degree of cogency, an appellant is entitled to an acquittal.  Finally, there is evidence that is
    sufficiently cogent to meet the criteria for the admission of fresh evidence on
    appeal in that it could reasonably have affected the verdict at trial, but is
    not sufficiently cogent to exclude the reasonable possibility of a conviction.  Evidence at this level of cogency requires a
    new trial:  see <i>R. v. Stolar</i> (1988), 40 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 10 (S.C.C.).    </span></p>

    available at trial, at least in the context of criminal cases where an
    appellant’s liberty is at stake, if the evidence is sufficiently cogent to
    warrant an acquittal.  It is not in the
    interests of justice to maintain a conviction where, on the totality of the
    evidence available to the appellate court, that court is satisfied that no
    reasonable jury could convict the appellant:  see also <i>Toronto (City) v.
    C.U.P.E. Local 79</i>, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 77 at 109-110.  Finality concerns are also diminished where the court of appeal
    is satisfied that an acquittal is the appropriate order.  The proceedings will end with an acquittal
    in the court of appeal.  The concerns to
    the due administration of justice associated with conducting a retrial many
    years after the event at which the evidence used to acquire the new trial may
    or may not be adduced do not arise where an acquittal is entered in the court
    of appeal.</span></p>

    “compelling”, the evidence offered on appeal must do more than simply meet the
    conditions precedent to the admissibility of that evidence.  Evidence offered on appeal to challenge
    factual findings at trial is inadmissible unless it is relevant to a material
    issue, reasonably capable of belief and sufficiently cogent that it could
    reasonably be expected to have affected the result at trial when considered in
    combination with the rest of the evidence:  <i>Palmer and Palmer v. The Queen</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 205.  In short, if the evidence is not
    sufficiently strong to compel the ordering of a new trial, it cannot be received
    on appeal.  </span></p>

    some added degree of cogency is necessary before the admission of the evidence

    would become irrelevant.  An accused who
    did not testify at trial could secure a new trial by advancing an explanation

    court of appeal must weigh the evidence to decide whether it is sufficiently
    cogent to merit admission despite its availability at trial.  Both counsel carefully reviewed the
    proffered evidence in their detailed written and oral submissions.  I will not review all of their
    arguments.  The evidence tendered on
    appeal, considered as a whole, meets the preconditions to the admission of
    evidence on appeal.  The relevance of
    the evidence to a material issue is not disputed.  There are many reasons to doubt the ultimate credibility of
    significant parts of the evidence, however, I cannot say that it is not
    reasonably capable of belief insofar as it offers an alternate explanation for
    the relevant parts of intercepts 74 and 75.  I am also satisfied that a reasonable jury considering the evidence
    tendered on appeal with the rest of the evidence at trial could reasonably be
    left with a doubt as to whether the references in intercepts 74 and 75 were to
    the murder of Silva or the shooting of Mr. Camara. </span></p>

    trial, it is far from convincing evidence.  The timing of the appellant’s disclosure, years after his conviction,
    and the manner in which the explanations for the conversations have evolved
    during the fresh evidence application raise significant credibility concerns.  The appellant’s explanation for shooting Mr.
    Camara makes little sense and his evidence as to his attitude toward Mr. Camara
    in the eighteen months following the shooting is rife with inconsistency.  There is also much merit to the Crown’s
    argument that it is hardly likely that the appellant would slip into a
    discussion about a shooting that had occurred eighteen months earlier in the
    same conversations in which he was discussing Silva’s shooting and the attempts
    by Silva’s “cousin” to find out about his involvement in Silva’s shooting.  </span></p>

    the most significant difficulty that the appellant has in attempting to

    Crown contended that the appellant was concerned about the inquiries being made

    the trial judge had to specifically tell the jury that evidence of Silva’s
    intention to meet with the appellant in the pool hall could not be used as

    in that conduct is relatively straightforward where the conduct involves only
    the person who made the statement.  In
    this case, Silva’s statement referred to attending a meeting with the appellant
    and his father, or perhaps just the appellant’s father.  <i>R. v.
    Starr</i>, <i>supra</i>, at paras. 166,
    168-174, and 182-183 establishes that Silva’s statement was not evidence of the
    appellant’s intention to attend the meeting at the pool hall.  <i>Starr</i> further stands for the proposition that a jury could not infer from Silva’s

    that the evidence of Silva’s intention was not any evidence that the appellant
    intended to go to the meeting and could not be used to infer that he went to

    argues that as the jury would have had no need to use the evidence for the very
    limited purpose for which it was properly admitted, it must follow that the
    jury somehow misused the evidence against the appellant.  I reject the logic of this argument.  If, as the appellant contends, the issue to
    which the jury was told in the recharge this evidence was relevant was not in

    appropriate.  The appellant does not
    allege that the evidence of Silva’s statement concerning his intention was
    inadmissible.  There is, however, an
    admissibility issue lurking just under the surface of the appellant’s
    argument.  The appellant’s submission
    proceeds on the basis that the evidence of Silva’s intention to go into the
    pool hall had no probative value beyond demonstrating that Silva acted in
    accordance with his stated intention and went into the pool hall.  Specifically, the appellant’s submission
    assumes that the evidence had no value on the ultimate question of whether the
    appellant met with Silva in the pool hall.  In taking this position, the appellant relies on the observations of the
    majority in <i>R. v. Starr</i>, <i>supra</i>, at paras. 182-183.</p>

    intention and could not be used to infer that the appellant attended the
    meeting, it is not clear to me that evidence of Silva’s intention to meet with
    the appellant had no probative value on the ultimate question of whether that
    meeting occurred.  It is arguable as a
    matter of common sense and human experience that Silva’s intention to meet with
    the appellant when he went into the pool hall, could, when considered in the
    context of the rest of the evidence, make the occurrence of that meeting more
    likely than it would have been had Silva not intended to go into the pool hall
    and meet the appellant.  If this
    reasoning is open, then Silva’s stated intention has some circumstantial
    relevance to the ultimate question of whether he met with the appellant in the
    pool hall: see S. Casey Hill <i>et al</i>., <i>McWilliams Canadian Criminal Evidence</i>, 4<sup>th</sup> ed., looseleaf (Aurora: Canada Law Book,<b> </b>2006) at para. 4:20.  On this
    approach, Silva’s stated intention was one brick, albeit a small one, in the
    evidentiary road leading to a finding that the meeting with the appellant
    occurred.  This is the approach taken by
    Chief Justice McLachlin in dissent in <i>R.
    v. Starr</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para.
    13:  see also Lee Steusser:  “<i>R. v.

    that the majority addressed the potential probative value of the evidence as
    described by the Chief Justice.  The
    majority clearly rejected the argument that a statement of the declarant’s
    intention could be used as evidence that an accused shared that intention.  It is equally clear that the majority
    rejected the claim that the evidence of the declarant’s intention could provide
    the basis for an inference that the accused acted in accordance with the
    declarant’s stated intention.  The Chief
    Justice did not, however, rely on either argument to support her assertion that
    evidence of the declarant’s intention had some probative value on the ultimate
    question of whether the declarant was with the accused.  As described above, she viewed the evidence
    of the declarant’s stated intention as having some potential circumstantial
    evidentiary value when it was considered as part of a larger package of
    circumstantial evidence from which the jury might infer that the event referred
    to by the declarant actually occurred.  </p>

    primarily from the absence of any relevance of the evidence of the declarant’s
    stated intention to a fact in issue in <i>Starr</i>,
    unless that evidence could somehow be linked to the question of whether the
    declarant met with the accused as he had said he intended to do.  If the evidence had no probative value on
    the question of whether that meeting ever occurred, it had no relevance in the
    case and should have been excluded on that basis without any inquiry into its
    admissibility as hearsay.  Since the
    majority in <i>Starr</i> seems to accept
    that if the evidence was properly admissible as hearsay it was admissible at
    trial, the majority must have regarded the evidence as having some potential
    probative value on the question of whether the deceased met with the accused.  </p>

    circumstantial evidence to be considered with other relevant circumstantial
    evidence on the issue of whether that event took place, remains an open
    question after <i>R. v. Starr</i>, <i>supra</i>.  However, even if that evidence of the declarant’s state of mind has some
    value as a piece of circumstantial evidence, its probative value will often be
    slight.  If there is a serious risk that

    not:  see <i>R. v. Brown</i> (1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 422 at 437-38 (N.S.C.A.); <i>R. v. Hertrich, Stewart and Skinner </i>(1982),
    67 C.C.C. (2d) 510 at 523 (Ont. C.A.).  Nor does counsel contend that the language of s. 21 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, which addresses
    accessorial liability, draws any distinction between liability as an accessory
    to a planned and deliberate murder and liability as an accessory to any other
    crime.  It does not.  Counsel relies on what he describes as
    “principle” and “logic”.  The principle
    invoked, sometimes referred to as the “fair labelling” principle, holds that
    the offence for which an offender is convicted, and the sentence imposed on
    that offender, should accurately reflect and be proportional to the offender’s
    actual culpability:  see Glanville
    Williams, “Convictions and Fair Labelling” (1983) 42 Cambridge L.J. 85; Andrew
    Ashworth, <i>Principles of Criminal Law</i>,

    proportionality analysis featured in cases like <i>R. v. Martineau</i> (1990), 58 C.C.C. (3d) 353 (S.C.C.) where it was
    argued that s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> rendered certain definitions of murder unconstitutional because those
    definitions did not require a culpable intent that was consistent with the
    stigma attached to the crime of murder:  see Don Stuart, <i>Charter Justice in
    Canadian Criminal Law</i>, 4<sup>th</sup>  ed. (Toronto: Thomson Canada, 2005) at 79-81.  The appellant does not make any constitutional argument on this

    abet perpetrators in the commission of crimes on the same legal footing.  Parliament has chosen to label perpetrators,
    aiders and abetters as “parties” to the crime.  For the purposes of determining criminal liability, all are equally
    culpable:  see <i>Thatcher v. The Queen</i> (1987), 32 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at 508-511

    issue on this appeal.  There are two
    components to the fault requirement: an intention to assist the perpetrator,
    and knowledge of the perpetrator’s intention.  The intention requirement is reflected in the phrase “for the purpose of
    aiding” found in s. 21(1)(<i>a</i>).  The aider must provide the assistance with
    the intention of helping the perpetrator commit the crime:  <i>R. v.
    Hibbert</i> (1995), 99 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at paras. 36-37 (S.C.C.).  In this sense, it can be said that the aider
    must intend that the offence will be committed.</p>

line-height:normal'>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The knowledge component of the fault requirement flows from
    the intention component.  An aider can
    only intend to assist the perpetrator in the commission of the crime if the
    aider knows the crime that the perpetrator intends to commit.  While the aider must know the crime the
    perpetrator intends to commit, the aider need not know the details of that
    crime:  <i>Dunlop and Sylvester v. The Queen</i> (1979), 47 C.C.C. (2d) 93 at 110
    (S.C.C.); <i>Regina v. Yanover and Gerol</i> (1985), 20 C.C.C. (3d) 300 at 329-30 (Ont. C.A.); V. Gordon Rose, <i>Parties to an Offence</i> (Toronto:
    Carswell, 1982) at 11. Consequently, a person who is said to have aided another
    in the commission of an attempted murder must know that the perpetrator intended
    to kill the victim:  <i>R. v. Adams</i> (1989), 49 C.C.C. (3d) 100
    at 110 (Ont. C.A.).  Similarly, a person
    who is alleged to have aided in a murder must be shown to have known that the
    perpetrator had the intent required for murder under s. 229(<i>a</i>):  <i>R. v. Kirkness</i> (1990), 60
    C.C.C. (3d) 97 at 127 (S.C.C.).</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The same analysis
    applies where it is alleged that the accused aided a perpetrator in the
    commission of a first degree murder that was planned and deliberate.  The accused is liable as an aider only if the
    accused did something to assist the perpetrator in the planned and deliberate
    murder and if, when the aider rendered the assistance, he did so for the
    purpose of aiding the perpetrator in the commission of a planned and deliberate
    murder.  Before the aider could be said
    to have the requisite purpose, the Crown must prove that the aider knew the
    murder was planned and deliberate.  Whether the aider acquired that knowledge through actual involvement in
    the planning and deliberation or through some other means, is irrelevant to his
    or her culpability under s. 21(1).    </p>

    trial judge correctly defined “planning” and “deliberation”.  He also correctly instructed the jury on the
    essential components of liability for first degree murder either as a
    perpetrator or an aider.  He reviewed
    the evidence of Silva’s mother and the contents of intercepts 74 and 75 and the
    respective positions of the Crown and defence as they related to that
    evidence.  The trial judge did not
    relate the evidence to the issue of whether the murder was planned and
    deliberate.  He did not direct the
    jury’s attention to the parts of the evidence that, should the jury conclude
    that the appellant was guilty of murder, could assist the jury in determining

    Woollcombe, for the Crown, in her able submissions, argues that it was
    unnecessary for the trial judge to deal separately with the evidence as it
    related to the issue of planning and deliberation.  As she put it in her factum:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span

    only defence advanced at trial was that the appellant was not involved in
    Silva’s murder.  Counsel for the
    appellant made no mention of the issue of planning and deliberation in his
    closing argument.  It is not surprising
    that he did not advance any position on behalf of the appellant on this
    issue.  An argument that the murder was
    not planned and deliberate could have undermined the claim that the appellant
    was not involved in the murder and, therefore, could have no idea of whether it
    was planned and deliberate.  </span></p>

    defence position at trial does not, however, mean that the characterization of
    the murder as first or second degree murder, if the jury found against the
    appellant on the issue of his involvement, was not a live issue for the
    jury.  In addition to the position of
    the defence, the nature of the allegation and the evidence led at trial must be
    considered to determine the issues upon which the trial judge must relate the
    evidence for the jury.  In this case, it
    was obvious that whoever shot Silva committed murder.  That was not a live issue.  The same cannot be said, however, with respect to whether the murder was
    first or second degree.  </span></p>

    first glance, the evidence suggests a gangland type murder, the paradigm of a
    planned and deliberate murder.  Closer
    scrutiny, however, puts the validity of that initial impression in doubt.  There is in fact very little evidence as to
    the nature of the relationship between Silva, on one hand, and the appellant
    and his father on the other hand, particularly as it relates to the debt owed
    to the Colombians.  The Crown’s claim
    that by killing Silva, the appellant and his father could somehow avoid paying
    the debt owed to the Colombians seems based more on speculation than on
    evidence.  The forensic and other
    physical evidence offered little to assist the Crown in establishing that the
    murder was planned and deliberate.  The
    evidence of Silva’s mother does not further the Crown’s case on first degree
    murder except insofar as it establishes the existence of the debt, the ongoing
    discussions concerning that debt, and Silva’s intention to meet with the
    appellant and his father.  There are one
    or perhaps two comments in the crucial intercepts that could be taken as
    supporting the claim that the murder was planned.  Those comments are not unequivocal.  </span></p>

    that the appellant murdered Silva, a closer review of the evidence suggests
    that there is little to choose between two possible scenarios.  On the first scenario, Silva was the victim
    of a planned ambush by the appellant and perhaps his father, a planned and
    deliberate murder.  On the second
    scenario, Silva was the victim of a failed negotiation with the appellant and
    perhaps his father, a murder, but not necessarily a planned and deliberate
    murder.</span></p>

    very much a live issue.  It was
    essential that the trial judge draw the jury’s attention to the evidence that
    could assist them in distinguishing between first and second degree murder,
    should the jury conclude that the appellant was guilty of murder.  It was particularly important that the trial
    judge do so because counsel for the appellant, by virtue of the defence
    advanced on behalf of the appellant, was not realistically in a position to
    marshal the evidence relevant to planning and deliberation or to argue that the
    murder was not a planned and deliberate murder.      </span></p>

    the trial judge relate the evidence to the issue of planning and deliberation,
