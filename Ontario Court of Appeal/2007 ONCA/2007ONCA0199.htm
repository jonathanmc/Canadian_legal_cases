  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal
    from the decision of Justice S. Bruce Durno, of the Superior Court of Justice,
    sitting as a summary conviction appeal court judge, dated June 11, 2003,
    dismissing the appellant’s appeal from conviction and sentence by Justice Hugh
    K. Atwood, of the Ontario Court of Justice, dated July 29, 2002.</span></h4>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the summary conviction appeal court judge made no
    reversible error when he concluded that although one of the reasons given by
    the trial judge for disbelieving the appellant was tenuous, the balance of the
    trial judge’s reasons were “neither so tenuous or misinterpreted to result in
    reversible error.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On our review of the record, apart from the one exception
    identified by the summary conviction appeal court judge, it was open to the
    trial judge to make the findings he did concerning the credibility of the
    defence evidence. Having rejected the defence evidence concerning whether the
    appellant’s consumption of alcohol was voluntary as being unbelievable and not
    raising a reasonable doubt, the trial judge did not err by finding that the
    appellant was guilty of the offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Most importantly, we agree with the summary conviction appeal
    court judge that there was a basis for the trial judge to conclude that there
    were inconsistencies in the appellant’s evidence concerning his experience with
    alcohol. When asked in-chief if he drank, the appellant responded, “Very rarely.
    Even this New Year’s I was – I had champagne and – that was it. I don’t really
    like the taste of alcohol.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In cross-examination, the focus of the questioning related to
    the appellant’s experience with intoxication and with detecting whether alcohol
    was having an effect on him.  In the
    course of responding, the appellant indicated that he had been intoxicated once
    as a teenager and that he may have had up to three glasses of champagne the
    previous New Year’s. He said there would be times that he would have a glass of
    wine with dinner, that when he did drink he usually had something to eat
    beforehand and that he never “really ever went for a buzz.” Significantly, the
    appellant also said that on the evening in question he had consumed one and a
    half beers in a little over half an hour even though the food was not ready
    yet. Nevertheless, he maintained that he did not feel the alcohol he had
    consumed (including both the beer and the vodka) having any effect on him. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s specific finding was that there were
    “inconsistencies with regard to [the appellant’s] past experience with alcohol
    and what happened on the night in question.” Based on the foregoing evidence,
    in our view, it was open to the trial judge to conclude not only that the
    appellant attempted to minimize his experience with alcohol in
    examination-in-chief but also to find that the appellant’s claim that he was
    not feeling the effects of alcohol on the evening in question was inconsistent
    with his testimony concerning his prior experience with alcohol. The appellant
    clearly had some experience with alcohol and had been intoxicated in the past.
    Given that context, there was a basis for the trial judge to hold that there
    were inconsistencies in the appellant’s testimony concerning his experience
    with alcohol and what happened on the night in question.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the summary conviction appeal court judge’s
    observation that the bases upon which the trial judge rejected the defence
    evidence were not overwhelming. However, it is not our function to retry the
    case. As noted, based on our review of the record, apart from the one exception
    identified by the summary conviction appeal court judge, it was open to the
    trial judge to make the findings that he did concerning the credibility of the
    defence evidence. Since the trial judge indicated he was not basing his
    decision on the unsupported finding, we agree with the summary conviction
    appeal court judge that that finding does not provide a basis for setting aside
    the trial judge’s decision. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also sought to raise ineffective assistance of
    trial counsel as a ground of appeal for the first time in this court. The
    appellant had different counsel on his summary conviction appeal than at trial
    and did not raise this ground at that level. In any event, based on the
    evidence presented, including the affidavit of trial counsel and the
    cross-examination thereon, there is no basis to conclude that trial counsel
    fell below the applicable standard in his conduct of the case.  Furthermore, two of the things the appellant
    claimed his trial counsel was remiss in failing to do – cross-examining the
    arresting officer more vigorously and calling a toxicologist – would not have
    assisted his case. The appellant also raises an issue about medication but his lawyer
    denies knowing about it and there is no evidence to show that it would have
    affected the breathalyzer reading.</p>

line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on the foregoing reasons, we would dismiss the appeal.</p>
