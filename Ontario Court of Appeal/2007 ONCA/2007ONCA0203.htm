  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the conviction
      entered by Justice B. H. Matheson of the Superior Court of Justice dated
      September 28, 2005</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>.</span></h4>
  <h2>ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s ex-girlfriend, the complainant, alleged that the appellant confined
    and assaulted her during the weekend of July 9<sup>th</sup>, 2004.  In relation
    to that weekend, the appellant was charged with assault, unlawful confinement,
    administration of a noxious substance and sexual assault.  He was also charged
    with threatening the complainant’s aunt, threatening the complainant’s mother
    and dangerous driving in relation to events on July 28<sup>th</sup>, 2004.  Further,
    he was charged with threatening the complainant between July 9<sup>th</sup> and
    September 1<sup>st</sup>, 2004.  Finally, he was charged with assaulting
    a police officer on August 31, 2004.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    a two week trial, the jury returned guilty verdicts on all counts relating
    to the July 9<sup>th</sup> weekend with the exception of an acquittal on
    the charge of administering a noxious substance.  The jury also found the
    appellant guilty of criminal harassment, threatening the complainant and
    assaulting a police officer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals from his convictions and raises three grounds: (1) the
    trial judge erred in instructing the jury on credibility and reasonable doubt;
    (2) the trial judge erred by failing to give a limiting instruction to the
    jury with respect to disposition evidence; and (3) the guilty verdicts returned
    by the jury were inconsistent with the acquittal on the charge of administering
    a noxious substance.  These will be dealt with in order.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Instructions on Credibility
      and Reasonable Doubt</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    essence of the appellant’s submission is that even though the jury was given
    a standard <i>W.D.</i> instruction, this was not enough to deter the jury
    from “their natural tendency to decide the case on the basis of a credibility
    contest”.  He goes on to say that the standard <i>W.D.</i> charge should
    now include “if after a careful consideration of all the evidence you are
    unable to decide who to believe, you must acquit”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are not prepared to say that the proposed addition to the standard <i>W.D.</i> instruction
    would be of assistance to juries.  The trial judge here repeatedly throughout
    his charge instructed the jury that the burden of proof was beyond a reasonable
    doubt and that it was solely the Crown’s burden.  This combined with the <i>W.D.</i> instruction
    that he did give and the closing arguments of appellant’s counsel satisfy
    us that the jury would not have been confused as to the burden of proof and
    how to treat findings of credibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    ground of appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Instructions Regarding Disposition
      Evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown elicited evidence from the complainant about prior incidents of violence
    against her by the appellant.  While the appellant accepts that this evidence
    was likely admissible, and trial counsel took no issue with it being elicited,
    he argues that he was prejudiced because no limiting instruction was given
    to the jury.  We disagree with this argument for two reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the evidence was admissible because it was relevant to several issues in
    the trial.  See <i>R. v. F. (D.S.)</i> (1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  These issues include such things as providing the jury with evidence
    of the nature of the relationship between the complainant and the appellant,
    that the charges were not as a result of isolated incidents, and to the reporting
    of the incidents in question by the complainant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    trial counsel made no objections to the admission of this evidence nor to
    the absence of a limiting instruction.  Indeed the evidence was relied upon
    by the defence to advance the defence theory.  Thus, in the circumstances
    of this case, we are not satisfied that the appellant was prejudiced by the
    lack of any limiting instruction.  This ground of appeal must also fail.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Inconsistent Verdicts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    sum, the appellant argues that since the jury acquitted the appellant of
    administering a noxious substance, it was unreasonable to convict him of
    the other July 9 weekend offences.  As we understand the argument, the appellant
    says that all the offences depended entirely on the complainant’s credibility
    and yet in acquitting him the jury must have disbelieved her.  Thus, the
    theory goes on, because the jury disbelieved the complainant on the one charge,
    and all the July 9<sup>th</sup> through 11<sup>th</sup> charges were closely
    related in time and context, there should have been a reasonable doubt in
    connection with all of them.  This ground of appeal must also fail.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jury is entitled to accept all, some or none of any witness’s testimony.  The
    jury is entitled to assess the guilt of an accused person on any theory of
    the evidence consistent with the instructions they receive.  On the issue
    of the pills, (i.e. the noxious substance) the jury could well have believed
    the complainant, but have a doubt that she had properly identified the substance,
    given her uncertainty about the container and origin of the pills.  The appellant,
    in our view, has failed to establish that the verdict is unreasonable on
    the basis that it is inconsistent with other verdicts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
