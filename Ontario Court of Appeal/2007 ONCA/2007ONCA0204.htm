    appellants seek to set aside the judgement of Justice D.L. McWilliam of the
    Superior Court of Justice dismissing their action for misfeasance in public
    office.  Damages were assessed at $1,552,317 and no costs were awarded to
    the defendants.  The defendants cross-appeal the award as to damages and
    the order as to costs.</p>

    behalf of the appellants, Mr. Nelson submits that the trial judge failed
    to apply the proper test for the tort of misfeasance in public office and
    that he erred in failing to find that the defendants had acted with the necessary
    recklessness or wilful blindness in the conduct of their public office to
    constitute that tort.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    test for establishing the tort is well settled.  As noted by Lord Steyn in <i>Three
    Rivers District Council v. Bank of England</i> [2003] 2 A.C. 1 (H.L.) at
    p. 191:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The case law
    reveals two different forms of liability for misfeasance in public office.  First
    there is the case of targeted malice by a public officer, i.e. conduct specifically
    intended to injure a person or persons.  This type of case involves bad faith
    in the sense of the exercise of public power for an improper or ulterior
    motive.  The second form is where a public officer acts knowing that he has
    no power to do the act complained of and that the act will probably injure
    the plaintiff.  It involves bad faith inasmuch as the public officer does
    not have an honest belief that his act is lawful.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    approach has been adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Odhavji Estate
    v. Woodhouse</i>, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 263 at pp. 280-282, and by this Court in <i>A.L.
    v. Ontario (Ministry of Community &amp; Social Services)</i>, [2006] O.J.
    No. 4673 at paras. 35-36.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is accepted that the case before us is not a case of
    “targeted malice” but, if anything, is a case that falls within the second
    form of liability referred to above.  Mr. Nelson submits forcefully, however,
    that the trial judge erroneously applied the targeted malice approach while
    purporting to apply the second branch of the test.  In this regard, he relied
    principally on the following passage from the trial judge’s reasons: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Consequently,
    in my review of the evidence, I am unable to find any egregiously wrongful
    act by the servants of the defendant Commission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    submits that the “egregiously wrongful act” comment could only refer to the
    targeted malice test and that the trial judge failed to consider that the
    respondents had done nothing to investigate the application for the transfer
    of the licence, thereby failing to act in accordance with the responsibilities
    of their public office.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is clear that the defendants considered the appellants’ application and reviewed
    the eighty pages of materials forwarded to them.  They therefore acted in
    furtherance of their duty to deal with the transfer application under s.
    6(2) of the <i>Alcohol and Gaming Regulations and Public Protection Act</i>,
    although they may have done so carelessly.  The trial judge carefully reviewed
    all of the legal principles underlying the tort of misfeasance in public
    office and carefully reviewed the evidence.  He made specific factual findings
    that there was no personal animosity towards the appellants and no malice
    or recklessness on the part of the respondents.  In effect, he found that,
    while the defendants’ conduct may have been negligent – even cavalier – it
    did not rise to the level of either conduct necessary to support a finding
    of misfeasance in public office, i.e. it was not conduct carried out with
    an ulterior motive and an intention to injure the appellants (targeted malice),
    nor was it the conduct of a public officer acting without an honest belief
    that her actions were lawful and likely to injure the plaintiffs (the second
    branch of the <i>Three Rivers</i> test).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The “egregiously
    wrongful act” comment came at the conclusion of the trial judge’s findings
    negating personal animosity, malice, and recklessness, and as an entrée to
    his consideration of s. 7 of the <i>Public Authority Protection Act</i>,
    where
    “egregious conduct” is relevant to divest the public officer of the limitation
    period defence: see <i>Beadsley v. Ontario</i> (2001), 57 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.)
    at para. 23.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    we do not see the comment as an indicia that the trial judge applied the
    wrong test.  As indicated above, we are satisfied that he was alive to the
    proper legal principles in play and that he properly applied them. His factual
    findings respecting animosity, malice and recklessness are supportable in
    the record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal as to the dismissal of the claim for misfeasance in public office
    is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a result, it is not necessary to deal with the cross-appeal as to damages,
    which is also dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    trial judge has a broad discretion in determining the costs of the proceeding,
    including the discretion to deprive a successful party of costs in appropriate
    circumstances: See <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, s. 131 rules 57.01(2) and
    (4).  Here, it was open to the trial judge to come to the decision he did
    with respect to costs because of his view that the successful party itself
    was at least partially responsible for circumstances leading to the litigation:
    see <i>Red Carpet Inns Ltd. v.
    <st1:State w:st="on">

line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Leave

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
