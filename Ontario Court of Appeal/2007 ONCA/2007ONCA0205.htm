    REIT is a Canadian public real estate investment trust whose units are traded
    on the Toronto Stock Exchange.  It owns and invests in senior living communities
    in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    and the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">

      United States</st1:country-region>
    .  In September 2006,
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Sunrise’s board of trustees determined that a strategic sale process of its

    Sunrise “in play” on the public markets.</p>

    carry out this plan, the Trustees developed a two-stage auction process with
    a view to maximizing the value of
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sunrise’s units.  Ventas, Inc. (“Ventas”) and Health Care Property Investors,
    Inc. (“HCPI”) were two of seven initially interested prospective purchasers
    in the auction process.  They emerged from the preliminary round as the only
    two potential bidders asked to participate in the final round.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ventas
    submitted a successful bid to acquire all of
    <st1:place

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Sunrise’s assets for a total purchase price of $1,137,712,410 (representing
    a price of $15 per unit), subject to unitholder approval.  HCPI withdrew
    from the auction process and did not bid at that time.  Instead, it put forward
    a post-auction bid –
    after it knew what Ventas had offered – “topping up” the Ventas offer by
    twenty per cent to $18 per unit.  This increased offer represents an additional
    $227.5 million for the unitholders, who are to meet on March 30, 2007, to
    consider the Ventas proposal.</p>

    executed by

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sunrise and Ventas following acceptance of the Ventas bid.  The issue is
    whether
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Sunrise is obliged to enforce the terms of a prior standstill agreement entered
    into between it and HCPI in the course of the auction process and which prohibits
    HCPI from making an offer for the

    Sunrise assets without
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Sunrise’s consent.  If the answer to that question is “Yes”,

    an urgent application, determined on March 6, 2007, Justice Pepall answered
    the foregoing question in the affirmative.

      it would not amend, modify, waive or fail to enforce any of the standstill
      terms or other conditions included in any of the confidentiality agreements
      between Sunrise REIT and any third parties. The standstill enforcement
      obligations are found in sections 4.4(1) and 4.4(8) of the Purchase Agreement.</span></p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left'><span
style='color:black;'>36 </span><span style='color:

      regard to “a bona fide written, unsolicited Acquisition Proposal (that
      did not result from a breach of this section 4.4).” Sections 4.4(2) and
      4.4(3) are prefaced with the words “notwithstanding anything contained
      in section 4.4(1).” Sections 4.4(2) and (3) do not say “notwithstanding
      anything contained in section 4.4(1) or 4.4(8).” If it had been the parties’
    contractual intention to exempt the circumstances described in sections 4.4(2)
    and (3) from the operation of section 4.4(8), they could have so provided
    but they did not. Similarly, unlike sections 4.7 and 4.8 which commence with
    the words “notwithstanding any other term of the Agreement”, sections 4.4(2)
    and 4.4(3) do not use this language.</span></p>
  <p align=left style='

style='color:black;'>38<b> </b></span><span
style='color:black'>    It seems to me that the clear scheme of this Purchase
      Agreement was [to] ensure enforcement of standstill agreements that had
      been signed as part of the auction process. This strikes me as being objectively
      reasonable and was a form of protection afforded to the purchaser, Ventas.
      This was part of the package negotiated between it and Sunrise REIT.</span></p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left'><span
style='color:black;'>39<b> </b></span><span
style='color:black'>    Such an interpretation derives from the words used by
      the parties to the Purchase Agreement and gives effect to the parties’ intention.
      It is also consistent with the context of the transaction including the
      auction process which was the genesis of the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase
      Agreement does not preclude bona fide written unsolicited Acquisition Proposals
      nor does it preclude such a proposal from a party whose standstill agreement
      operated to permit such a proposal. It simply precludes a proposal from
      anyone who is in breach of its standstill agreement. While creative, I
      view Sunrise REIT's and HCP's interpretation arguments to be strained.
      They disregard the parties’ intention and the true meaning of the subject
      sections and the Purchase Agreement as a whole. [Footnote omitted.]</span></p>

    agree with the application judge that an important purpose of this part of
    the Purchase Agreement is to ensure the enforcement of standstill agreements
    entered into by previous players in the auction process.  The negotiating
    context demonstrates that Ventas has been skilful in protecting its own position
    with respect to competition and standstills – unlike the HCPI Standstill,
    the Ventas/Sunrise Standstill Agreement expired at the conclusion of the
    auction – and it is objectively reasonable, given this background, that it
    would seek protection against competition from those who were unsuccessful
    in the auction, particularly its principle competitor.</p>

    I read section 4.4 of the Agreement, it has four major components.  First,
    it contains the overriding obligation of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Sunrise not to solicit other bids, buttressed by the commitment of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Sunrise to enforce existing standstill agreements that may be in place with
    bidders who have already engaged in the auction process (section 4.4(1)).  Secondly,
    it contains the “fiduciary out” protection for the Sunrise Trustees (and
    unitholders), permitting the Trustees to consider <i>bona fide</i> unsolicited
    Acquisition Proposals from third parties (<u>that are not in breach of the
    provisions of section 4.4</u>) (sections 4.4(2) and 4.4(3)).  Thirdly, it
    contains a series of provisions dealing with how the parties are to address
    a situation where a permitted Acquisition Proposal is received (sections
    4.4(3) – 4.4(7)).<a href="#_ftn5"

'>[5]</span></span></span></a>  Lastly, section 4.4(8)(v) returns to the general
    non-solicitation obligation, reinforcing it by ensuring that Sunrise will
    (i) ensure all of its officers, Trustees and agents are aware of the non-solicitation
    provisions, (ii) immediately stop negotiating with anyone previously involved
    in the bidding process, (iii) require those bidders to return any confidential
    documentation and information they may have received during the process,
    (iv) terminate access to the data room by anyone other than Ventas and its
    representatives, and finally (a reiteration of the requirement set out in
    section 4.4(1)):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(v) not amend,
    modify, waive or fail to enforce any of the standstill terms or other conditions
    included in any of the confidentiality agreements between Sunrise REIT and

line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary
    to the appellants’ submissions, however, it is not <i>any </i>Acquisition
    Proposal that the Trustees are free to consider as part of the fiduciary
    out scenario; it is only an Acquisition Proposal from a third party <u>that
    is not in breach of section 4.4 of the Agreement</u>.</p>

line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Properly
    understood in this fashion, then, a reading of section 4.4 demonstrates that
    there is no <i>conflict</i> between the provisions of sections 4.4(1)(ii),
    4.4(2), 4.4(3) and 4.4(8)(v).  The repeated standstill enforcement terms<i> complement</i> one
    another.  As the application judge pointed out, the opening phrases of sections
    4.4(2) and 4.4(3) – “notwithstanding anything contained in Section 4.4(1)” – do
    not have the words “or Section 4.4(8)(v)”
    added to them.  This reinforces the interpretation that section 4.4(8)(v)
    is there to clarify that Sunrise’s obligation to enforce its Standstill Agreements
    with third parties is not negated by the fiduciary out clause.  An unsolicited
    proposal by a prior bidder bound by a Standstill Agreement is a proposal
    that is otherwise in breach of section 4.4, because it violates section 4.4(8)(v),
    and therefore is not immunized by the fiduciary out provisions.</p>

    that sense, contrary to the appellants’ submissions, the application judge’s
    reading of the Purchase Agreement does not reduce section 4.4(8)(v) to simply
    the functional equivalent of section 4.4(1)(ii).  Nor is it a case of section
    4.4(8)(v) continuing to require the enforcement of a Standstill Agreement
    even when the fiduciary out clause is otherwise applicable.  The fiduciary
    out clause does not apply where the unsolicited proposal is tendered in breach
    of the non-solicitation provisions of the Purchase Agreement, i.e., in breach
    of a Standstill Agreement that
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sunrise is obliged to enforce.  The fiduciary out formula is an important
    feature of the non-solicitation format, but it does not allow

    two provisions.  He points out that section 4.4(1)(ii) expressly refers to
    situations involving “an actual or potential Acquisition Proposal” whereas
    section 4.4(8)(v) contains no such reference, and further, that other subsections
    of section 4.4(8) – namely, sections 4.4(8)(ii) and (iii) – refer to Acquisition
    Proposals as well, although not in the context of standstill agreements (4.4(8)(ii)
    and 4.4(8)(iii)).  Because section 4.4(8)(v) does not refer to “Acquisition
    Proposals”, Mr. Howard submits it does not apply in the context of such a
    proposal and therefore does not apply in the context of the HCPI Acquisition
    Proposal.</p>

line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are several problems with this argument.  First, it misapprehends the fact

    of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Sunrise
    – whether made before or after the close of the auction – constitutes an “Acquisition
    Proposal” as defined in the Agreement.  Consequently, section 4.4(8)(v) can
    only apply in the context of an Acquisition Proposal of some sort, regardless
    of its wording.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly,
    the argument appears to be founded on the unarticulated premise that an Acquisition
    Proposal, as referenced in sections 4.4(1)(ii), 4.4(2) and 4.4(3), is the
    equivalent of a Superior Proposal.  The appellants’ theory of the Agreement
    is that the Trustees are entitled to consider any Acquisition Proposal received
    after the close of the auction, and that the commitment in section 4.4(8)(v)
    to enforce standstill agreements only applies in the event that a subsequent
    Acquisition Proposal received by the Trustees does not make the grade as
    a Superior Proposal.  The function of section 4.4(8)(v), they say, is to
    permit the Trustees in such circumstances to prevent a bidder in such a case – whether
    a prior bidder or not – from continuing to participate in the bidding process. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is not the case, however, that an Acquisition Proposal and a Superior Proposal
    are the same thing.  The latter is a narrower concept than the former.  While
    an Acquisition Proposal is essentially an offer by anyone to acquire more
    than twenty percent of the assets of

    a financial point of view than the Ventas bid.  Sunrise submits, at paragraph
    43 of its factum, that section 4.4(8)(v) “is part of the filtering protection
    for both Ventas and Sunrise REIT that allows and obliges Sunrise REIT to
    deal summarily with offers that do not meet the Acquisition Proposal threshold.” 
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City

    Sunrise does not mean the “Acquisition Proposal threshold” in this statement,
    however; it means the “Superior Proposal threshold.”  To support the appellants’
    argument, the reference to “Acquisition Proposal” in section 4.4(1)(ii) would
    have to be read as “Superior Proposal”.  That is not what it says. </p>

    and in any event, a careful reading of section 4.4(1)(ii) does not bear out
    the nexus between the reference to “Acquisition Proposal” and the commitment
    to enforce the standstill agreements.  For ease of reference I repeat the
    wording of section 4.4(1)(ii) here:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>4.4(1) Following

    Sunrise agrees not to participate in discussions or negotiations regarding
    actual or potential Acquisition Proposals.  It also agrees not to release
    anyone from, or fail to enforce, existing Standstill Agreements.  The drafters
    could well have divided section 4.4(1) into six general prohibitions rather
    than five.  The commitment to enforce the Standstill Agreements is not, therefore,
    tied to “Acquisition Proposals” in a way that section 4.4(8)(v) is not.</p>

    – the interpretation of a commercial contract – and, while she may not have
    dealt with the foregoing themes expressly as the appellants would like, her
    reasons, read as a whole, indicate that she was alive to most, if not all,

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>38        It
    seems to me that the clear scheme of this Purchase Agreement was [to] ensure

    a form of protection afforded to the purchaser, Ventas.  <u>This was part
    of the package negotiated between it and Sunrise REIT</u>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    to the Purchase Agreement and gives effect to the parties’ intention.  It
    is also consistent with <u>the context of the transaction including the auction
    process which was the genesis of the Purchase Agreement</u>.  The Purchase
    Agreement does not preclude bona fide written unsolicited Acquisition Proposals
    nor does it preclude such a proposal from a party whose standstill agreement
    operated to permit such a proposal.  It simply precludes a proposal from
    anyone else who is in breach of its standstill agreement. [Emphasis added,

    decision in
    <st1:State w:st="on">

    that is the target of a takeover bid – or, in this case, the Trustees – have
    a fiduciary obligation to take steps to maximize shareholder (or unitholder)
    value in the process: see <i>CW Shareholdings Inc. v. WIC Western International
    Communications Ltd.</i> (1998), 39 O.R. (3d) 755, at 768 and 774 (Gen. Div.).  That
    is the genesis of the “fiduciary out”
    clauses in situations such as the case at hand.  They enable directors or
    trustees to comply with their fiduciary obligations by ensuring that they
    are not precluded from considering other <i>bona fide</i> offers that are
    more favourable financially to the shareholders or unitholders than the bid

    no limits on the directors’ right to consider superior offers and that any
    provision to the contrary is invalid and unenforceable: see <i>Paramount
    Communications, Inc. v. QVC Network Inc.</i> 637 A. 2d 34 (Del. 1994), and <i>ACE

    obtained for Sunrise’s assets, in a fashion resembling a “shotgun” clause,
    by requiring bidders to come up with their best price in the second round,
    subject to a fiduciary out clause that allowed them to consider superior
    offers from anyone save only those who had bound themselves by a Standstill
    Agreement in the auction process not to make such a bid.  In this case, that

    an auction to the point where they attracted a successful bidder.  This is
    not a case where the Trustees were unable to judge the adequacy of the bid
    (<i>Schneider</i>, at 200).  They had dealt with seven prospective purchasers
    in the course of the two auction rounds, and had received preliminary proposals.  Ventas’s
    $15.00-per-unit price represented a 35.8% increase over the market price
    of the Units on the date the auction closed.  I do not think the Trustees
    can be said to have failed in the exercise of their fiduciary obligations
    to their unitholders in these circumstances simply by agreeing in the Purchase
    Agreement to preclude earlier bidders, who had bound themselves under Standstill
    Agreements not to do so, from coming in after the auction was concluded and
    the “successful” bidder had showed its cards and attempting to “top up” that
    bid.</p>

line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is well accepted that “where an agreement admits of two possible constructions,
    one of which renders the agreement lawful and the other of which renders
    it unlawful, courts will give preference to the former interpretation”: John
    D. McCamus, <i>The Law of Contracts</i> (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2005) at 729.  Advancing
    this principle, the appellants argue that we should be loathe to adopt an
    interpretation of the Purchase Agreement that is inconsistent with overarching
    fiduciary obligations.  While I accept the principle put forward, however,
    I do not think it applies in the context of this case for the reasons outlined
    above.  The interpretation given to the Purchase Agreement by the application
    judge is not inconsistent with the Trustee’s fiduciary obligation to maximize
    unitholder value.  Indeed, it is consistent with that obligation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    Mr.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Leon</st1:country-region>
    emphasizes the importance of the word “nothing” in the opening language of
    sections 4.4(2) and 4.4(3) of the Purchase Agreement.  Both provisions open
    with the words “Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 4.4(1), until
    the Unitholder Approval, <i>nothing</i> shall prevent the Board from …” [emphasis
    added].  Mr.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Leon</st1:country-region>
    submits that “nothing” means what it says, and must be given the full scope
    of that meaning, in order to ensure that “nothing” in the Purchase Agreement
    or otherwise is permitted to stand in the way of the Trustees performing
    their duty to maximize shareholder value.  This point involves parsing the
    Purchase Agreement in a microscopic fashion that is a little too fine, in
    my view.  The use of the word “nothing” in sections 4.4(2) and 4.4(3) is
    nothing more than a different way of saying “Notwithstanding anything contained
    in Section 4.4(1) … <u>the Board is not prevented from</u> …”.  I would not
    ascribe to it the expanded role that HCPI proposes.</p>

    appellants also attack the conclusion of the application judge that the HCPI
    Acquisition Proposal was not a “<i>bona fide</i>” offer.  She accepted the
    Ventas submission that “a proposal made in breach of a contractual obligation
    not to make such a proposal cannot be considered to be <i>bona fide</i>,”
    noting that sections 4.4(2) and 4.4(3) of the Purchase Agreement contemplate
    an Acquisition Proposal from a third party “that did not result from a breach
    of …
    Section 4.4”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was much debate about the meaning of “<i>bona fide</i>”.  The application
    judge viewed it as meaning acting “in good faith; sincere, genuine”, relying
    upon <i>The Oxford English Dictionary</i>.<a
href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    was not <i>bona fide</i> because it was made in breach of the HCPI Standstill
    Agreement, which
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Sunrise was obliged by s. 4.4 to enforce.  The appellants agree that <i>bona
    fide</i> means “genuine” or “made in good faith” but submit that a <i>bona
    fide</i> Acquisition Proposal, as contemplated by the Purchase Agreement,
    is one that is “genuine” or “authentic”
    in the sense that it is not a sham and is reasonably capable of becoming
    a Superior Proposal, and that this decision must be made in the context of
    the entire situation.</p>

    the end, there is not much difference between the parties as to the meaning
    of the term “<i>bona fide</i>”.  As with the principles of contract interpretation,
    they differ on the application of the term in the circumstances of this case.  Given
    the language of the Purchase Agreement, and the context in which it was negotiated
    – particularly the language “that did not result from a breach of this Section
    4.4” in sections 4.4(2) and 4.4(3) – I do not think the application judge
    erred in her assessment and use of the term “<i>bona fide</i>” here.</p>

    HCPI argued that
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    Sunrise had given its prior consent to HCPI to make its subsequent Acquisition
    Proposal following completion of the auction process and the execution of
    the Purchase Agreement.  This consent is said to derive from the waiver
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sunrise gave to both HCPI and Ventas as part of the invitation to bid in
    the second round.  The application judge made a specific finding against
    this position, however, concluding that the December 29, 2006 letter “cannot
    possibly be construed as constituting Sunrise REIT’s prior written consent
    as that term is used in the Standstill Agreement.”  There is no basis for
    interfering with this finding.</p>

line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly,
    HCPI submitted that the position of Ventas on these applications was tantamount
    to saying that the benefit of the HCPI Standstill Agreement had been assigned
    to it.  The application judge correctly found that there was no merit in
    this argument.  I agree with her that neither the Standstill Agreement nor
    its benefits had been assigned to anyone, and no one was taking the position
    that they had.</p>

    Sunrise were permitted.  The application judge declined to deal with this
    request, given her ruling which effectively precluded the HCPI Acquisition
    Proposal from being pursued.  She concluded the application was moot.</p>
