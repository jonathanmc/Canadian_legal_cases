  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>I.          INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the early 1990s, the respondents, Canadian National Railway Company and allied
    corporations (the “CN companies”), undertook the construction of a new railway
    tunnel under the St. Clair River between Sarnia, Ontario and Port Huron,
    Michigan.  Lovat Tunnel Equipment Inc. (“Lovat”), an experienced tunnel equipment
    manufacturer, was selected to construct a custom-designed tunnel boring machine
    (the “TBM”) for the project.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    TBM began boring the tunnel in November 1993.  Approximately two months later,
    it broke down, resulting in damage to the TBM itself and a 229-day delay
    in the opening of the new tunnel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    CN companies held a builders risk insurance policy issued by the appellant
    insurers that insured them against “ALL RISKS of direct physical loss or
    damage…to all real and personal property of every kind and quality including
    but not limited to the [TBM]” (the “Policy”).  When the CN companies sought
    indemnity under the Policy for their losses, the insurers denied coverage,
    relying on exclusions in the Policy that exempted from coverage “the cost
    of making good…faulty or improper design” and “inherent vice”.  The CN companies
    sued the insurers for recovery under the Policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    lengthy trial ensued before Ground J. of the Superior Court of Justice.  As
    relevant to these proceedings, he held that: (i) the cause of the failure
    of the TBM was “excess differential deflection between components of the
    TBM which the TBM was not capable of withstanding”;<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></a></span> (ii) this damaged the TBM’s sealing system, thereby
    allowing contaminants to access the TBM’s main bearing; (iii) the excess
    differential deflection that caused the failure of the TBM was not foreseeable;
    (iv) the coverage exclusions invoked by the insurers did not apply; (v) a
    Policy exception to the faulty or improper design exclusion for “resultant
    loss or damage” did not provide coverage in this case; (vi) if, contrary
    to his conclusion, the faulty or improper design exclusion applied, this
    exclusion extended to all loss or damage caused by the faulty or improper
    design of the TBM; and (vii) no physical loss or damage to the tunnel itself
    was occasioned by the failure of the TBM, within the meaning of the coverage
    provisions of the Policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    judgment dated October 7, 2004, the trial judge held the insurers liable
    under the Policy for damages in the sum of $20,966,947.00.  In so doing,
    he reduced the damages claimed by the CN companies by about $440,000 on account
    of the benefit realized by the CN companies on the settlement of an action
    commenced by them against Lovat.  The trial judge also awarded the CN companies
    prejudgment interest in the amount of $8,615,691.90 based on an average prejudgment
    interest rate calculated from August 23, 1995, the date that the insurers
    denied coverage under the Policy.  Finally, the trial judge awarded the CN
    companies their costs of the action, fixed in the amount of $1,150,837.35.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    insurers appeal the liability finding against them.  As ultimately argued
    before this court, they advanced two grounds of appeal.  First, they submitted
    that the trial judge erred by holding that the excess differential deflection
    that damaged the TBM’s sealing system was not a foreseeable risk and that
    design error was not established at trial, with the result that the faulty
    or improper design exclusion did not apply.  In the alternative, the insurers
    asserted that the trial judge erred in his interpretation of the inherent
    vice exclusion by holding that it had not been made out by the insurers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In
    the event that the insurers’ appeal is successful, the CN companies cross-appeal
    from: (i) the trial judge’s application of a “foreseeability standard”, rather
    than a
    “standard of reasonable foreseeability”, to the construction of the faulty
    or improper design exclusion; (ii) the trial judge’s interpretation of the
    scope of the faulty or improper design exclusion; (iii) the trial judge’s
    interpretation of the resultant loss or damage exception to the faulty or
    improper design exclusion; and (iv) the trial judge’s finding that there
    was no physical loss or damage to the tunnel occasioned by the failure of
    the TBM, within the meaning of the coverage provisions of the Policy.  The
    CN companies also cross-appeal, on various grounds, from the quantum of damages
    and costs awarded by the trial judge, and from his calculation of prejudgment
    interest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, we would allow the appeal.  In our view, the trial
    judge erred by holding that the faulty or improper design exclusion did not
    apply.  We see no error, however, in his conclusion that the inherent vice
    exclusion was not engaged in this case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would dismiss the cross-appeal.  We see no error in the trial judge’s approach
    to the construction of the faulty or improper design exclusion.  We agree
    with the trial judge that the resulting loss or damage exception to the faulty
    or improper design exclusion does not provide coverage, and that this exclusion
    extends to all loss or damage caused by the faulty or improper design of
    the TBM, including the costs incurred in inspecting, repairing and modifying
    the TBM.  Nor do we see any error in his holding that there was no direct
    physical loss or damage to the tunnel arising from the failure of the TBM.  Finally,
    given the view that we take of the proper disposition of these proceedings,
    the remaining grounds of cross-appeal raised by the CN companies – concerning
    the quantum of damages and costs awarded to them and the trial judge’s calculation
    of prejudgment interest – are moot. </p>

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(1)       TBM’s Sealing System </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    TBM was a huge and complex machine. It was the largest TBM ever built by
    Lovat, being approximately 25% larger than any of the Lovat TBMs previously
    manu-factured.  Indeed, at the time, it was the largest TBM of its kind in
    the world.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    TBM was cylindrical in shape, with a diameter of approximately thirty-two
    feet and a length of 278 feet.  It had a circular rotating cuttinghead at
    the front of its forward shell, to which various excavation tools could be
    attached.  The cuttinghead was driven by hydraulic thrust generated by a
    large main bearing located in a chamber in a static part of the TBM’s forward
    shell.  When the cuttinghead was operational, excavated materials fell through
    openings in the cuttinghead into a hollow chamber (the plenum), from which
    they were eventually removed from the tunnel by means of a conveyor and auger
    system.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    TBM was a soft “earth pressure balance”<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a> machine, which was intended to maintain “equality” between
    the pressure of the earth on the cuttinghead, on the one hand, and the pressure
    of the cuttinghead on the earth, on the other hand.  Maintenance of this
    equality prevented overburden soils on the top of the TBM from settling or
    heaving.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    TBM’s main bearing was critical to the functioning of the entire machine.  To
    shield it from damage by contamination from soil and other materials, the
    TBM was designed with a unique and extensive sealing system, the sole purpose
    of which was to prevent soil and other materials from accessing, and thereby
    contaminating, the main bearing.  This consisted of a series of twenty-six
    separate seals, most of which were affixed to a seal ring located between
    the cuttinghead and the “bulkhead” at the face of the static chamber of the
    TBM’s forward shell.  Some of the seals were also attached to the cuttinghead
    and the bulkhead, or were located in the main bearing itself.  While the
    TBM was in use, pressurized grease was injected into the sealing system to
    prevent the ingress of soil and other contaminants.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the TBM’s seals to be effective, a “seal gap” of no less than three millimetres
    and no more than six millimetres had to be maintained between the rotating
    cuttinghead and the static bulkhead of the TBM.  This was imperative because
    if the seal gap was too large, grease would pour out of the machine or materials
    would flow in.  Conversely, if the seal gap fell below approximately three
    millimetres, the seals would be rendered ineffective and possibly crushed,
    allowing soils or other contaminants to bypass the seals and access the main
    bearing of the TBM.  Thus, the maintenance of the seal gap was vital to the
    proper functioning of the sealing system, which, in turn, was essential to
    protect the TBM’s sensitive main bearing.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    design of the sealing system was described by various witnesses at trial
    as conservative, consisting of a system of
    “redundancy”.  Among other matters, this meant that each seal operated independently
    of the others.  For the purpose of protecting the main bearing, the sealing
    system was the TBM’s ‘Maginot Line’: to penetrate the vulnerable main bearing,
    dirt or contaminants had to get past all the seals.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    critical need to prevent contamination of the TBM’s main bearing was recog-nized
    from the outset of Lovat’s engagement.  For example, Lovat’s construction
    contract with CN included the following specification:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The design shall be such that the head seals and
    bearings [<i>sic</i>] are not subject to damage from excessive wear or contam-ination
    from soil entering the bearing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lovat
    had previously designed and built 124 TBMs.  This TBM, however, was distinctive
    in several respects.  First, each TBM, including each TBM cuttinghead system,
    was unique and designed for a specific application.  In this case, the cuttinghead
    design configuration for the TBM had not been manufactured or used by Lovat
    before.  Second, although the same type of seals that were used in this TBM
    had been employed in other Lovat TBMs, their configuration varied from machine
    to machine.  The sealing system on this TBM, including the geometry of the
    seal cavity, was unique.  Third, although component seals of the type installed
    as part of this TBM’s sealing system had functioned successfully in other
    Lovat TBMs (including at pressures greater than those encountered in the
    St. Clair River Tunnelling Project), the whole of the sealing system had
    not previously been tested by Lovat in a TBM of this type and size.  Finally,
    the enormous size of this TBM distinguished it from predecessor TBMs.  As
    CN’s expert engineering witness at trial, Dr. Leslie G. Hampson, put it: “The
    St. Clair TBM was breaking new technical ground being the biggest machine
    of its type.”</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(2)       Design Process</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    process utilized to design and construct the TBM was elaborate and sophis-ticated,
    involving many of the world’s foremost TBM and tunnelling experts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    design process included the formation of a technical committee, composed
    of expert tunnelling contractors and consultants, to advise the CN companies
    on the conceptual design parameters for the TBM, among other matters.  This
    committee’s work was guided by a steering committee, which furnished general
    guidance on the construction of the TBM.  Mr. Rick Lovat, a mechanical engineer
    and then the vice-president of Lovat who was responsible for overseeing the
    conceptual design of Lovat’s products, participated in the meetings of the
    technical committee.  Although this committee was dissolved before tenders
    were called for the tunnel contract, its members developed a list of the
    key components of the TBM.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, Hatch Mott MacDonald (“Hatch”), an engineering firm, was engaged
    to provide engineering managerial services for the tunnel project.  As well,
    a technical review committee was struck to monitor, review and advise the
    CN companies on the project as a whole.  This review committee, which received
    presentations by a team of tunnelling experts, met frequently prior to the
    commencement of the tunnelling and at least twice after the failure of the
    TBM.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly,
    both the technical and technical review committees were concerned chiefly
    with conceptual, rather than detailed, design issues regarding the TBM.  Perhaps
    for this reason, as we mention later in these reasons, these committees were
    not provided with certain test results and other data available to Lovat
    regarding the design and the anticipated performance of the TBM.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Instead,
    once Lovat won the tender for the tunnel project, it was responsible for
    the detailed design and engineering of the TBM, and for its structural integrity.  Rick
    Lovat testified at trial that Lovat was also responsible for ensuring that
    the structural components of the TBM did not “deflect or deform in any unwanted
    way” when the machine was operational.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    Lovat was engaged, it retained Wardrop Engineering Inc. (“Wardrop”) to conduct
    finite element analyses on key components of the TBM, including the outer
    shell, the cuttinghead, the cuttinghead flange, the bearing assembly (including
    the seal ring), and the fixed bulkhead.  These computer modelling analyses
    were intended to simulate and predict how the tested elements of the TBM
    would react under anticipated load, stress and strain conditions.  In particular,
    one of the purposes of the analyses was to determine whether, and to what
    extent, critical components of the TBM might deflect under assumed conditions,
    and the impact of such deflection should it occur.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    modelling inputs, including the anticipated design loads for the TBM, were
    either provided to Wardrop by Lovat directly or by geotechnical engineers
    at Lovat’s request.  In its final report, Wardrop concluded that stresses
    from the anticipated design loads for the TBM were within acceptable yield
    criteria, with the result that the TBM was “capable of resisting the loads
    provided by Lovat which account for the anticipated operation [<i>sic</i>]
    conditions” of the TBM.  According to Rick Lovat, Lovat understood from this
    report that the modelled components of the TBM might deflect under various
    loads but that they would maintain their elasticity, that is, they would
    revert to their original shape and not “break or deform”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Wardrop analyses revealed the predicted absolute deflection of each of the
    modelled TBM components.  They did not address, however, the anticipated
    relative deflection of all the components on an ‘as assembled’
    basis.  Wardrop cautioned Lovat that the determination of “a more representative
    deflection” of the bearing plate assembly, cuttinghead and forward shell
    of the TBM would require an additional detailed finite element analysis.  Wardrop
    also stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>We anticipate the results of the more detailed
    analysis would reflect a <i>reduced deflection</i> of the bearing plate area
    because of the increased stiffness from the thrust bearing, cutting- head,
    and bearing plate interface.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
    further finite element analysis was commissioned by Lovat.  Rick Lovat testified
    that this was not undertaken because Lovat anticipated that the results of
    an additional analysis, as suggested by Wardrop, would be more “conservative”,
    that is, the predicted levels of deflection would be even lower than those
    indicated by Wardrop’s original analyses.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    according to Rick Lovat, the relative deflection of the TBM components could
    be readily calculated and, in fact, was calculated by Lovat and Wardrop in
    December 1992.  Rick Lovat believed that these additional calculations – referred
    to by the parties as part of an “overlay exercise”
    concerning the Wardrop reports – permitted Lovat to predict the extent to
    which differential deflection would occur between the key elements of the
    TBM and, hence, whether the seal gap of the TBM would widen or narrow under
    assumed conditions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
    notes or other written record of the overlay exercise or of the resulting
    differential deflection calculations were kept.  Consequently, these important
    data were not available for review by any of the committees involved in the
    design process or by the Hatch engineering firm.  Similarly, it appears that
    the Wardrop reports and the Wardrop calculations were not reviewed by any
    of the design committees.  Nor were any detailed dimension drawings of the
    TBM’s sealing system provided to the committees or Hatch.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(3)       Failure and Repair

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    December 28, 1993, after the TBM had been operational for about two months,
    a potential problem in the sealing system was detected.  To investigate the
    suspected problem, the TBM was diverted to a location at which the cuttinghead
    could be removed from the tunnel for inspection by means of a vertical shaft
    constructed for that purpose.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    inspection of the cuttinghead, extensive damage to the sealing system was
    discovered, particularly in the outer areas of the seal ring, due to metal-to-metal
    contact and other degradation processes.  Curiously, however, not all the
    seals were crushed or otherwise compromised.  Nonetheless, soil and other
    contaminants had infiltrated the main bearing of the TBM, and the sealing
    system as a whole had failed.  The TBM’s ‘Maginot Line’ had been overcome.  The
    trial judge stated: “[I]t is clear that the seals overall failed to perform
    as intended.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lovat
    repaired the TBM by introducing several design changes at a relatively low
    cost.  These included the addition of a bronze “wear ring” to the bulkhead
    of the TBM to prevent the seals from being crushed in the future.  Tunnelling
    then recommenced and eventually was completed on December 8, 1994.  Subsequent
    re-examination of the cuttinghead revealed that excess differential deflection
    had occurred again, but without significant damage to the seals.  </p>

    for the investigation of the failure of mechanical equipment and tribology
    (the science of lubrication, friction and wear applicable to machine components
    such as bearings, seals and gears).  Dr. Hampson has specific experience
    with TBM sealing problems.  He is not an expert, however, in structural engineering

    as an expert in structural engineering and failure investigation.  In contrast
    to Dr. Hampson, Dr. Becker has no particular expertise in tribology, sealing

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    Drs. Hampson and Becker prepared a series of reports regarding the design
    and the cause and foreseeability of the failure of the TBM, and both testified
    at trial.  There was considerable common ground between their causation opinions.  In
    particular, they both agreed that the damage occasioned to the TBM was caused
    by excess differential deflection.  The trial judge indicated in his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[62]     With respect to faulty or improper design,
    both experts also agree that the physical evidence of damage to the seals
    and other components of the TBM must lead to the conclusion that there had
    been excess differential deflection as between the plenum and the bulkhead.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>….</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[65]     The failure with which we are concerned
    in the case at bar is the failure of the TBM to operate as intended so as
    to prevent soil or other foreign material from passing through the seal gap
    and entering into the bearing chamber thereby creating a risk of damage to
    the bearing.  As to the cause of the failure, the totality of the evidence
    before this court, and particularly the evidence of the experts, Dr. Hampson
    and Dr. Becker, is that the damage to the seals and the wear on components
    of the TBM indicating metal-to-metal contact between the rotating component
    and the stationary component indicate that the seal gap had closed at certain
    points below the permitted tolerance and that such closure is consistent
    with excess differential deflection.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Drs.
    Hampson and Becker disagreed, however, on whether the cause of the failure
    of the TBM – excess differential deflection – was foreseeable.  In a report
    dated May 21, 2003, Dr. Hampson offered the following opinions:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Underlying causes of the failure</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>24.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was and remains my opinion that the essential engineering cause of the failure
    was small amounts of differential structural deflection of the cutter-head
    [<i>sic</i>] in the area of the sealing elements which proved incapable of
    with-standing that deflection. …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>….</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>30.       In my opinion, differential deflection
      in the seal area could not have been foreseen at this time and in this
      situation.  Identifying such a ‘needle in a haystack’
    requires knowledge both that it is necessary and also knowing where to focus
    attention.  With hindsight, this is always clear. …</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>32.       It is unrealistic to expect that every
    possible failure mode will always be anticipated and avoided especially when
    advancing technology – if so there would never be any failures in service.  What
    happened in this case is that the TBM failed by a mechanism that was not
    anticipated and was outside previous experience. …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>34.       The St. Clair TBM is not a situation
    in which the potential failure mechanism was predicted and the external conditions
    were more severe than expected – hence causing the failure.  It is the opposite
    in that the external conditions were accurately predicted but the failure
    mechanism could not be foreseen and the established and successful design
    process did not aim to deal with it.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, Dr. Hampson revised his opinion on foreseeability as expressed in
    para. 30 of his May 2003 report, quoted above.  In an exchange with the trial
    judge, he acknowledged that “differential deflection is inevitable”, and
    that it was incorrect to say that differential deflection could not have
    been foreseen.  Dr. Hampson claimed, however, that what could not have been
    foreseen was <i>excess</i> differential deflection sufficient to “[close]
    the seal gap to or below the critical amount in all the seal locations”.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was Dr. Becker’s opinion that the TBM’s sealing system failed due to differ-ential
    deflection arising because the structure of the TBM’s cuttinghead lacked
    sufficient rigidity to maintain the seal gap necessary to protect the main
    bearing of the TBM.  In his view, this lack of rigidity was an
    “inherent structural design defect in the cuttinghead”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Becker strongly disagreed with Dr. Hampson’s opinion that the excess differential
    deflection was not foreseeable.  Dr. Becker maintained that Lovat’s engineers
    “knew or ought to have known” that the TBM’s sealing system was vulnerable
    to failure because of the “enormous loads” to be transmitted through the
    cuttinghead, which would cause deflections “that would reduce the running
    gap required for these seals”.  Dr. Becker claimed that the failure of the
    TBM could have been averted if an appropriate seal ring had been installed
    in the TBM from the outset.  He also said that the consequences of a sealing
    system failure could have been mitigated if the design of the TBM had accommodated <i>in
    situ</i> repairs.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to Dr. Becker, these defects established that the structural engineering
    of the TBM fell below the applicable structural engineering standard, with
    the result that the design of the TBM was flawed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Drs.
    Hampson and Becker both testified that a combination of circumstances, including
    excess differential deflection, could have led to the failure of the TBM’s
    sealing system.  There was no evidence at trial, however, that any circumstances
    other than excess differential deflection occurred.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>IV.       TRIAL JUDGE’S DECISION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge held:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[66]     [T]he cause of the failure of the TBM
    was excess differential deflection between components of the TBM which the
    TBM could not accommodate and which resulted in damage to the sealing system
    permitting soil and other foreign material to enter the main bearing area
    of the TBM.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    summarizing his principal holdings at the end of his reasons, the trial judge
    expressed his causation conclusion this way (at para. 174): “The cause of
    the failure of the TBM was excess differential deflection between components
    of the TBM which the TBM was not capable of withstanding.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge rejected the insurers’ claim that the failure of the TBM was
    caused by faulty or improper design within the meaning of the Policy.  In
    his view, the applicable jurisprudence in Ontario required, as a prerequisite
    to any holding that a design was “faulty” or “improper”, the finding that
    the design failed to
    “accommodate or provide” for a condition or occurrence that was foreseeable,
    however unlikely or remote (at para. 68).  He held that the cause of the
    failure of the TBM <span style='font-size:
14.0pt'>–</span> excess differential deflection between components of the TBM
    that the TBM was not capable of withstanding <span style='font-size:14.0pt'>–</span> was
    not foreseeable, that “the design of the TBM was such as to accommodate all
    foreseeable risks” and that, accordingly, the design of the TBM was neither
    faulty nor improper within the meaning of the faulty or improper design exclusion
    (at paras. 76 and 174).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge reached a similar conclusion regarding the inherent vice exclusion.  He
    held that this exclusion related strictly to the peril of a vice inherent
    or incidental to the insured property itself, as distinct from loss occasioned
    by an extraneous or “adven-titious” cause (at para. 58).  He accepted the
    CN companies’ submission that the insurers had not discharged their onus
    of establishing the inherent vice exclusion (at para. 59).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also held that, if he was incorrect in concluding that the cause
    of the failure of the TBM was not foreseeable, with the result that the exclusion
    for faulty or improper design applied, the CN companies could not recover
    for resultant loss or damage (at para. 99).  He rejected the CN companies’ submission
    that the faulty or improper design exclusion applied only to the cost of
    making good the faulty design of the TBM – that is, to the cost of inspecting,
    repairing and modifying the TBM – and not the peril of faulty or improper
    design itself.  In the trial judge’s view, properly read, the faulty or improper
    design exclusion applied to all loss or damage caused by the faulty or improper
    design of the TBM, including the inspection, repair and modification costs
    incurred by the CN companies (at paras. 81, 94 and 174).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge rejected the CN companies’
    claim that the temporary blockage of the tunnel while repairs and modifications
    were being made to the TBM constituted physical loss or damage to the tunnel
    itself, within the meaning of the Policy.  Rather, the positioning of the
    TBM in the tunnel was a deliberate act taken in the course of construction
    of the tunnel.  Accordingly, it was not a risk of direct physical loss or
    damage to insured property for which coverage was provided under the Policy
    (at paras. 105, 106 and 174). </p>

    the foreseeability of the mechanism by which the TBM might fail and the foreseeability
    of the risk of such failure; and (iv) the trial judge’s approach to foreseeability

    in these reasons, we make these preliminary observations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge correctly recognized that the insurers bore the onus at trial
    of establishing the application of an exclusion under the Policy.  His reasons
    indicate that he was also aware that the courts have applied different standards
    in the construction of faulty design exclusions for the purpose of determining,
    in a given case, whether the faulty design of insured property was made out.  The
    trial judge characterized these varying standards in these terms: (i) the “<i>prima
    facie</i>” standard, which contemplates that the fact of the failure of the
    property in question establishes that the design of the property was flawed;
    (ii) the “reasonable foreseeability” or tort standard, which mandates an
    inquiry into whether all reasonably foreseeable risks were taken into account
    in the preparation of the design; and (iii) the “foreseeability” standard,
    which requires that the design in question provide for all foreseeable risks.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    Ontario, the Superior Court adopted a standard of foreseeability in the construction
    of faulty design exclusions in <i>Foundation Company of Canada Limited v.
    American Home Assurance Company</i> (1995), 25 O.R. (3d) 36 (Gen. Div.),
    aff’d. [1997] O.J. No. 2332 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) and <i>Algonquin Power (Long Sault) Partnership v. Chubb Insurance Co.
    of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    </i>, [2003] O.J. No. 2019.  As expressed by the trial judge in <i>Foundation</i> at
    pp.&nbsp;47-48, this standard requires that “All foreseeable risks must be
    taken into account in a design.”  See also <i>Algonquin</i> at paras. 176
    and 179.   In contrast, a <i>prima facie</i> standard has been endorsed by
    courts in other jurisdictions: see <i>Queensland Government Railways and
    Electric Power Transmission Pty., Ltd. v. Manufacturers’
    Mutual Insurance, Ltd.</i> (1968), [1969] 1 Lloyd’s L.R. 214 (H.C.A.); <i>Willowbrook
    Homes (1964) Ltd. v. Simcoe and Erie General Insurance Co., </i>[1980] A.J.
    No. 855 (C.A.);<i> B.C. Rail Ltd. v. American Home Assurance Co.</i> (1991),
    79 D.L.R. (4th) 729 (B.C.C.A.).   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the trial judge adopted the foreseeability standard enunciated
    in <i>Foundation</i> and <i>Algonquin</i> as appropriate to the interpretation
    of the faulty or improper design exclusion, holding (at para. 54):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I…conclude that the law of Ontario is that the
    standard to be applied to determine whether a design was faulty or improper
    is that insured property must be designed so that it accommodates all foreseeable
    risks, even though such risks may be unlikely and remote, and that the standard
    is not the <i>prima facie</i> standard…nor a standard of reasonable foresee-ability
    or negligence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Elsewhere
    in his reasons, the trial judge reiterated this conclusion in these terms
    (at para. 174):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The applicable standard to determine whether there
    is faulty or improper design of the TBM is that the TBM must be designed
    to withstand all foreseeable risks in the sense of being foreseeable even
    if unlikely or remote.  The standard is not a <i>prima facie</i> standard
    nor a reasonably foreseeable or negligent standard.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>And, at para. 68:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   I adopt the conclusion reached by Wilson J.
    in <i>Foundation, supra</i>, that in order to find that a design was faulty
    or improper, one would have to find that the design failed to accommodate
    or provide for a condition or occurrence that was foreseeable, however unlikely
    or remote.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>See also paras. 55, 59, 66 and 76
    of the trial judge’s reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the above-referenced passages from his reasons, the trial judge repeatedly
    stated that to establish a faulty or improper design, the foreseeability
    standard that he accepted requires a showing that the design in issue failed
    to “accommodate” all foreseeable risks.  He also referred to the relevant
    design
    “provid[ing] for” or “withstand[ing]” such risks.  We do not regard these
    descriptors as departing in any material way from the requirement expressed
    by the trial judges in <i>Foundation, supra</i> and <i>Algonquin, supra</i> that
    all foreseeable risks “be taken into account” in the challenged design.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the trial judge’s formulation of the foreseeability standard properly
    recognized that satisfaction of this standard requires proof that all foreseeable
    risks have been identified and addressed in the design in question.  Mere
    recognition of a fore-seeable risk is insufficient. “Accounting” for a foreseeable
    risk contemplates both that the risk is identified and that provision or
    allowance is made in the impugned design to meet the identified risk.  On
    the foreseeability standard, anything less will not establish a fault-free
    and proper design.  Nor, in our opinion, does designing against a foreseeable
    risk convert the risk into an unforeseeable one.  It simply means that the
    applicable design provided for the risk, that is, the risk was identified
    and addressed in the design with a view to forestalling its occurrence, thus
    meeting the foreseeability standard.  In this context, we agree that the
    foreseeability standard mandates that the relevant design “take into account”, “accommodate”, “provide
    for” and “withstand” all foreseeable risks.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    accepted this foreseeability standard as appropriate to the interpretation
    of the faulty or improper design exclusion, the trial judge then applied
    this standard to the facts of this case, holding that the cause of the failure
    of the TBM was not foreseeable and that the design of the TBM “was such as
    to accommodate” all foreseeable risks (at para. 76).  These key foreseeability
    findings precluded reliance by the insurers on the faulty or improper design
    exclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None
    of the parties to these proceedings attacked the trial judge’s formulation
    of the foreseeability standard.  Rather, as relevant to their interests,
    they challenged the appropriateness and manner of its application by the
    trial judge in this case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    their factum, for example, the insurers argued that the trial judge’s adoption
    of this standard was misconceived.  They asserted that the use of the word
    “faulty” in the exclusion does not reference a legal standard derived from
    negligence law.  Rather, the language of the exclusion simply establishes
    the requirement that the design in question be
    “defective”, that is, not fit for the purpose intended.  Thus, in effect,
    the insurers urged adoption of what the trial judge termed a <i>prima facie</i> standard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    oral argument before this court, however, the insurers took the position
    that even on the standard of foreseeability endorsed by the trial judge,
    they had met their onus to invoke the faulty or improper design exclusion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    satisfy this onus, it is insufficient to demonstrate merely that the challenged
    design failed to perform as expected.  It suffices to establish that the
    impugned design failed to provide for all foreseeable risks, including those
    that were reasonably fore-seeable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    insurers’ case on appeal in respect of the faulty or improper design exclusion
    rests on the claim that even the demanding standard accepted by the trial
    judge was satisfied, with the result that the exclusion was triggered.  In
    these circumstances, for the purpose of the <i>appeal</i>, the determination
    of whether a less stringent standard might apply in evaluating the design
    of the TBM is not required: see this court’s decision in <i>Foundation, supra</i> at
    para. 3.  Nor is it necessary to address the insurers’ additional argument
    that the standard in fact applied by the trial judge was the tort standard
    of reasonable foreseeability.  We will return to the issue of the standard
    of foreseeability adopted by the trial judge in our discussion of the issues
    in the cross-appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>(ii)      Foreseeability of Risk and Design Error</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s penultimate holding concerning the faulty or improper design
    exclusion was set out at para. 76 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Accordingly, applying the applicable standard as
    developed in the recent judicial decisions in this province, it is my view
    that excess differential deflection to the extent necessary to cause the
    failure of the TBM which occurred was not foreseeable in the sense of being
    foreseeable even though unlikely or remote.  I conclude therefore that the
    design of the TBM was such as to accommodate all foreseeable risks and that
    accordingly the failure of the TBM was not caused by faulty or improper design
    as referred to in the exclusion of “the cost of making good faulty or improper
    design” in clause I 3(d) (iii) of the Policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    is apparent from these statements, the trial judge’s conclusion that the
    faulty or improper design exclusion could not be relied upon by the insurers
    to deny coverage rests on his foreseeability findings.  These findings, in
    turn, are predicated on and flow from the trial judge’s causation analysis.   </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US>(a)       Trial Judge’s Causation Analysis</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    overarching causation issue at trial was the determination of the cause of
    the failure of the TBM.  Both experts agreed, and the trial judge accepted,
    that this failure was occasioned by the contamination of the TBM’s main bearing
    due to the collapse of the TBM’s protective sealing system.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    critical component of this issue, however, concerned the cause of the failure
    of the sealing system itself.  The trial judge recognized the significance
    of this issue, commenting, “The failure with which we are concerned in this
    action is the failure of the sealing system of the TBM…The major issue to
    be determined is <i>the cause of such failure</i>”
    (at para. 24).  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    reviewing the evidence of both Drs. Hampson and Becker on the issue, the
    trial judge concluded “on all of the evidence before [the] court”, that the
    cause of the failure of the TBM was excess differential deflection that the
    TBM could not accom-modate (at para. 66) or withstand (at para. 174).   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    reaching this conclusion, the trial judge reasoned in part:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[55] In the case at bar, <i>there is no evidence
      of any possible cause of the failure of the TBM other than excess differential
      deflection</i>.  The question becomes whether the  elimination of all other
      possible causes of the failure establishes that the failure must be due
      to excess differential deflection. …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[56]   The only evidence before the court as to
    possible causes of the failure is the evidence of the two expert witnesses
    who were consistent in that the only possible causes of failure could be
    faulty or improper design, inherent vice, faulty or inadequate maintenance,
    faulty operation, overpressurization of the plenum or overheating of the
    seals.  <i>Both experts agreed that there was no evidence of the latter four
    possible causes.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>….</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[62]     With respect to faulty or improper design, <i>both
      experts also agree that the physical evidence of damage to the seals and
      other components of the TBM must lead to the conclusion that there had
      been excess differential deflection</i> as between the plenum and the bulkhead. …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>….</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[65] As to the cause of the failure, <i>the totality
      of the evidence before this court</i>, and particularly the evidence of
      the experts, Dr. Hampson and Dr. Becker, <i>is that the damage to the seals
      and the wear on components of the TBM</i> indicating metal-to-metal contact
      between the rotating component and the stationary component <i>indicate
      that the seal gap had closed at certain points</i> below the permitted
      tolerance <i>and that such closure is consistent with excess differential
      deflection</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s reasons demonstrate that he was also alive to the evidence
    of Drs. Hampson and Becker that some combination of circumstances could have
    led to the compromise of the TBM’s sealing system.  At para. 66 of his reasons,
    the trial judge expressly adverted to Dr. Hampson’s evidence on this issue,
    but then commented:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am not aware of any evidence before the court
    indicating that any circumstance other than excess differential deflection
    had occurred although both experts agree that it is difficult to explain
    how excess differential deflection caused damage to certain of the seals.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge elaborated at para. 67:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Both [experts] concede that there could be some
    combination of circumstances, which combined with the excess different-tial
    deflection, resulted in the failure.  Even if there was some combination
    of circumstances including the excess differen-tial deflection, in the absence
    of any evidence of any unpre-dicted or unusual external cause or condition,
    some com-bination of circumstances must all have been circumstances relating
    to the TBM itself.  Accordingly, one must conclude, on the balance of probabilities,
    that the design of the TBM was deficient in that it was not able to perform
    as specified under expected or normal conditions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    as the insurers maintain, the trial judge found that there was no evidence
    of a cause of the failure of the TBM independent of the TBM itself.  To the
    contrary, the evidence pointed exclusively to excess differential deflection
    as the root cause of the failure.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the trial judge’s holding that the TBM failed due to excess differential
    deflection that it could not “accommodate”
    and that it was not “capable of withstanding” when the TBM’s sealing system
    was overcome, was amply grounded in the expert evidence at trial.  To this
    extent, there is no basis for appellate interference with the trial judge’s
    holdings.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That,
    however, does not end the matter.  The difference of opinion between the
    engineering experts was a narrow but central one: it concerned whether excess
    differ-ential deflection was foreseeable when the TBM was designed.  The
    trial judge indicated at para. 67:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The critical difference of opinion between Dr.
    Hampson and Dr. Becker is that it is Dr. Hampson’s view that “the differential
    deflection in the seal area could not have been foreseen at this time and
    in this situation” whereas, it is Dr. Becker’s view that the lack of rigidity
    causing the excess differential deflection was the result of a design defect
    that should have been foreseen by Lovat. ...The difference of opinion as
    between the experts is whether the failure was foreseeable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    we read his reasons, the trial judge saw little or no difference between
    the opinions of the engineering experts as to the cause of the failure of
    the TBM.  We agree.  As a result, the real issue in respect of the faulty
    or improper design exclusion concerns the trial judge’s pivotal findings
    that “excess differential deflection to the extent necessary to cause the
    failure of the TBM which occurred was not foreseeable” and that
    “the design of the TBM was such as to accommodate all foreseeable risks”.  </p>

    CN companies argue that the trial judge’s foreseeability findings are unassailable.  We
    disagree.  For four reasons, we accept the insurers’ contention that the

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    in undertaking his foreseeability analysis, the trial judge considered in
    detail the evidence of Drs. Hampson and Becker regarding the foreseeability
    of the cause of the failure of the TBM.  He accepted Dr. Hampson’s opinion
    that excess differential deflection compromising of the TBM’s sealing system
    was not foreseeable.  In doing so, however, the trial judge failed to consider
    Rick Lovat’s evidence on the foreseeability of this failure risk.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the course of summarizing Dr. Hampson’s evidence, the trial judge alluded
    to the finite element analyses performed by Wardrop to determine the anticipated
    deflection of specific components of the TBM –
    including the cuttinghead and the bearing assembly – under predicted pressures,
    and the results of those analyses (at para. 26).  He also referred to Dr.
    Hampson’s evidence about the Wardrop analyses and the “overlay exercise” conducted
    by Lovat and Wardrop in relation to the Wardrop results (at paras. 23 and
    27), and to Dr. Becker’s testimony regarding the sufficiency of the Wardrop
    modelling (at paras. 28 to 30).  Later in his reasons, the trial judge outlined
    the insurers’ position that the Wardrop analyses were deficient or inaccurate
    and that they signified that Lovat was aware of the risk of excess differential
    deflection (at para. 74) and the response of the CN companies to these claims
    (at para. 73).  He did not review, however, Rick Lovat’s evidence on these
    issues.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is undisputed before this court that Lovat was aware when it designed the
    TBM that: (i) the main bearing of the TBM was a critical component of the
    TBM; (ii) it was essential to maintain the TBM’s seal gap within the specific
    design tolerance of six millimetres if the main bearing was to be insulated
    from contaminants; (iii) soil and other contaminants presented a serious
    threat of damage to the main bearing if they came into contact with that
    bearing; and (iv) the structural integrity of the TBM was solely Lovat’s
    responsibility.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is against this unchallenged factual backdrop that Rick Lovat’s testimony
    concerning the risk of excess differential deflection and the steps taken
    by Lovat to address that risk must be considered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rick
    Lovat was Lovat’s lead representative on the tunnelling project.  He was
    cross-examined extensively at trial on what Lovat knew at the time that the
    TBM was designed, and on the purpose, nature and results of the Wardrop analyses
    and the overlay exercise.  He confirmed that, in its finite element analyses,
    Wardrop investigated whether any of the modelled TBM components would deflect
    under anticipated pressures and, if so, to what degree.  During cross-examination,
    he said: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And

    in his cross-examination, Rick Lovat acknowledged that if the seal flange
    of the TBM deflected at a different rate than the fixed bulkhead, differential
    deflection affecting the critical seal gap would occur.  He also conceded
    that if the deflection of the seal flange exceeded the deflection of the
    fixed bulkhead, the seal gap would narrow.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect of the overlay exercise, Rick Lovat testified that it caused him
    to believe that Lovat was able to predict “the <i>extent</i> to which differential
    deflection between the [modelled] elements was occurring”.  [Emphasis added.]  Importantly,
    he also said that, by virtue of the overlay exercise, Lovat specifically
    addressed its mind to the prospect that differential deflection could occur
    that would damage the TBM’s sealing system by narrowing the seal gap.  On

    admissions indicate that Lovat knew when the TBM was designed that differential
    deflection posed a serious potential danger to the TBM’s sealing system.  More
    importantly, <i>the extent of this potential danger</i> was investigated
    by Lovat and Wardrop.  As a result, it was Lovat’s opinion that the magnitude
    of such deflection would not compromise the sealing system.  Although this
    opinion may have been understandable on the basis of Wardrop’s modelling
    and Lovat’s interpretation of the overlay exercise calculations, this does
    not detract from the fact that, according to Rick Lovat, this type of risk
    was both known to and investigated by Lovat or its agents.  Indeed, during
    his testimony, Dr. Hampson confirmed that he had been informed by Rick Lovat
    that as a result of the Wardrop analyses and the overlay exercise, Rick Lovat
    had concluded that the seal gap of the TBM would be maintained at a “satisfactory
    level”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    one point in his reasons, the trial judge noted that the Wardrop analyses
    were conducted to “determine the extent of differential deflection” (at para.
    75).  Significantly, however, he made no mention of Rick Lovat’s testimony,
    quoted above, in his foreseeability analysis.  Nor does the record otherwise
    support the conclusion that the trial judge assessed the significance of
    this evidence in making his foreseeability findings.  Instead, the trial
    judge’s foreseeability analysis was focused on the expert engineering evidence
    about foreseeability and excluded any consideration of the import of Rick
    Lovat’s evidence on this fundamental issue. </p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The second kind of error that may warrant appellate

    or misapprehending that evidence.  When the appellate court finds such an
    error it must first determine the effect of that error on the trial judge’s

    recognize that the trial judge was not required to refer to all the evidence
    in his reasons and that his factual findings, absent palpable and overriding
    error, attract deference from this court.  The trial judge’s lengthy reasons
    demonstrate an impressive command of the trial record, and a detailed consideration
    of much of the evidence.  Nor should we be taken as suggesting that the trial
    judge failed to consider any of Rick Lovat’s evidence, or the ample evidence
    establishing that the possibility of differential deflection was an issue
    of which the TBM design participants were aware.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
    differential deflection is not the same as differential deflection of the
    type or magnitude sufficient to overtake the sealing system of the TBM, that
    is, excess differential deflection compromising of the TBM’s sealing system.  The
    trial judge expressly found that the latter risk was not foreseeable.  We
    do not read his reasons as indicating that he was satisfied that the risk
    of such excess differential deflection was identified and taken into account
    in the design of the TBM.  To the contrary, we read his reasons as holding
    precisely the opposite: this form of risk was not foreseeable or foreseen,
    with the result that the faulty or improper design exclusion was not triggered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yet,
    Rick Lovat’s evidence bore directly on this issue and, hence, on material
    findings of fact that led the trial judge to conclude that the faulty or
    improper design exclusion did not apply.  His evidence was highly relevant
    to the question of whether the failure of the TBM’s sealing system due to
    excess differential deflection was foreseeable and foreseen and, thus, to
    the ultimate question of whether the faulty or improper design exclusion
    applied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    these circumstances, Rick Lovat’s testimony could not be disregarded.  We
    conclude that the trial judge’s failure to consider the import of this evidence
    taints his foreseeability findings with palpable and overriding error warranting
    appellate inter-vention. </p>

lang=EN-US>Misapprehension of evidence</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the trial judge’s foreseeability findings appear to have been based, at least
    in part, on a misapprehension of the evidence concerning the technical committees’ and
    Lovat’s knowledge of the risk of failure of the TBM due to excess differential
    deflec-tion.  In this respect, as well, the trial judge erred in processing
    the evidence leading to his critical foreseeability findings.  We say this
    for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    holding that the cause of the failure of the TBM –
    excess differential deflection that overcame the TBM’s sealing system – was
    not foreseeable, the trial judge relied on his earlier factual finding that
    the Wardrop analyses and Lovat’s review of those analyses “appear to have
    been accepted by the [design] committees as addressing any concerns with
    respect to differential deflection” (at para. 75).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary
    to this finding, however, there was no evidence at trial that any of the
    technical committees or Hatch reviewed the results of the overlay exercise.  The
    record indicates that only those Lovat and Wardrop personnel who took part
    in the overlay exercise saw these differential deflection calculations.  Moreover,
    there was no evidence at trial demonstrating that the committees evaluated
    the Wardrop analyses, or the risk of failure of the TBM’s sealing system
    due to excess differential deflection.  For example, the minutes of the meeting
    of the technical committee contain no reference to any discussion about the
    possible deflection of the cuttinghead of the TBM.  As well, the trial judge
    found that the design committees asked very few questions about the TBM’s
    sealing system or its potential for differential deflection (at para. 69).  In
    these circumstances, the trial judge’s conclusion that the design committees
    were satisfied by the Wardrop analyses and the overlay exercise with respect
    to differential deflection concerns is not supported by the record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, at para. 75 of his reasons, the trial judge relied on Dr. Hampson’s
    suggestion, set out in his May 2003 report, that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Cuttinghead differential deflection and the
      potential effect on the sealing elements</i> had not been a previous problem
      and <i>was not identified at the time by anyone as a potential problem</i>.  The
      assembled expertise had no reason to antici-pate this new failure process.  [Emphasis
      added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence, however, established that the Wardrop analyses and the overlay
    exercise were intended to address the potential for damaging differential
    deflection on various components of the TBM, including the cuttinghead and
    the seal gap.  Thus, Dr. Hampson’s assertion that the potential effect of
    differential deflection on the TBM’s sealing elements “was not identified
    at the time by anyone as a potential problem” was inaccurate and the trial
    judge’s reliance on it was misplaced.  Contrary to Dr. Hampson’s claim, this
    potential risk was both recognized and investigated by Lovat – the designer
    of the TBM.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    unsupported finding of the trial judge, set out above, and his endorsement
    of the quoted passage from Dr. Hampson’s report appear in the trial judge’s
    reasons immediately before his articulation of his dispositive findings on
    foreseeability.  In our view, it is clear that they formed part of the underpinnings
    for those findings.  This part of the trial judge’s reasoning process was
    both tainted by error and essential to his foreseeability findings.  As observed
    by this court in <i>Waxman, supra</i> at para. 335, a finding of fact in
    the absence of any evidence is a serious processing error, which constitutes
    a palpable error. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span
lang=EN-US>Conflation of foreseeability risks</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    we also agree with the insurers that the trial judge erred by failing to
    distinguish between the foreseeability of the type of risk of failure that
    occurred here and the foreseeability of the mechanism by which such risk
    might materialize.  This error went to the heart of the trial judge’s forseeability
    analysis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    we have already indicated, relying on <i>Foundation, supra</i> and <i>Algonquin,
    supra</i>, the trial judge concluded that the determination of whether the
    design of the TBM was faulty or improper required an inquiry into whether
    the TBM was designed so that it accommodated or provided for all foreseeable
    risks, even though such risks might be unlikely or remote.  At para. 67 of
    his reasons, he correctly stated that, under this standard, the relevant
    question was whether “the risk which caused the failure” was fore-seeable.  Ultimately,
    the trial judge held at para. 76 that “excess differential deflection to
    the extent necessary to cause the failure of the TBM which occurred was not
    foreseeable in the sense of being foreseeable even though unlikely or remote”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge appears to have based this holding on Dr. Hampson’s revised evidence
    at trial, given in response to a question by the trial judge, that while
    differential deflection was both inevitable and foreseeable, the scale of
    the differential deflection that occurred was not foreseeable.  During Dr.
    Hampson’s testimony, the following interchange took place:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            The Court:      And it would be correct
    to say it’s not – it’s not right that differential deflection could not have
    been foreseen, what could not have been foreseen was differential deflection
    sufficient to, I think as you put it, collapse all the seals?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            The Witness:  Close all the seal gaps,
    or take – let me be specific because I haven’t been specific in the way I
    should – of closing the seal gap to or below the critical amount in all the
    seal locations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this exchange, Dr. Hampson conceded, apparently for the first time, that
    the type of risk of damage to the TBM’s sealing system that occurred in this
    case – damage from differential deflection – was foreseeable.  However, he
    also shifted the focus of his foreseeability opinion away from the foreseeability
    of the type of risk involved, to the foreseeability of the scale of that
    risk.  By accepting this nuanced shift in Dr. Hampson’s evidence, the trial
    judge conflated the foreseeability of the type of risk that could cause the
    failure of the TBM with the foreseeability of the magnitude of this risk.  In
    so doing, in our opinion, the trial judge erred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue of the scale of the risk of differential deflection was an inquiry
    into whether the mechanism by which differential deflection might damage
    the sealing system was foreseeable, rather than an inquiry into whether it
    was foreseeable that deflection compromising to the seal gap might occur
    at all.  However, the controlling issue to be determined at this trial was
    whether the type of risk of failure of the TBM that materialized was foreseeable.  If
    it was not, the insurers could not rely on the faulty or improper design
    exclusion to deny coverage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    fairness to the trial judge, given Dr. Hampson’s evidence, this confusion
    may well have arisen because Dr. Hampson repeatedly emphasized the foreseeability
    of the “potential failure mechanism” of the TBM.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[6]</span></span></span></a>  By accepting Dr. Hampson’s evidence that the
    TBM failed by a mechanism that was not anticipated, the trial judge failed
    to focus on the foreseeability of the failure risk in issue – the risk of
    differential deflection affecting the integrity of the TBM’s sealing system.  The
    failure “mechanism” or event ultimately described by Dr. Hampson in his evidence
    was not the risk of such damaging differential deflection but, rather, the
    combination of that risk with the inadequacy of the measures taken to address
    or accommodate it in the design of the TBM.  While that combination may have
    been unforeseeable, this is not tantamount to a conclusion that the risk
    itself was unforeseeable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    CN companies rely on <i>Foundation, supra</i> to argue that the type of risk
    of failure at issue in this case was not foreseeable.  The facts in <i>Foundation</i>,
    however, are not analogous to the facts of this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Foundation</i>,
    during the construction of a substructure on a bridge, a cofferdam on the
    bridge experienced a blow-in (the sudden erosion or collapse of part of the
    river rockbed in the vicinity of the cofferdam), which was caused by a pocket
    of gas and slickenside.  The applicable insurance policy contained an exclusion
    concerning “the cost of making good faulty or defective…design”.  The trial
    judge found as a fact that there was no experience or knowledge in the engineering
    community when the dam was designed regarding the combined effect of slickenside
    and gas.  Rather, the combined presence of gas and slickenside was an unpredictable,
    unknown, and rare event.  As a result, this combination of circumstances
    was not taken into account in the design of the dam.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[7]</span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    contrast, in this case, the technical committees and Lovat knew that structural
    steel can deflect under various loads and pressures.  Lovat and Wardrop recognized
    the potential danger of differential deflection to the cuttinghead and the
    seal gap.  They undertook analyses the admitted purposes of which included
    the determination of whether differential deflection that could exceed the
    design tolerance of the TBM’s seal gap, thereby narrowing the gap and endangering
    the main bearing, would occur under worse case conditions.  Thus, the potential
    occurrence of the causative event of the failure of the TBM was anticipated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    unlike the facts in <i>Foundation</i>, the trial judge in this case explicitly
    found that there was no evidence of an external cause of the failure of the
    TBM.  To the contrary, he held that even under the unproven thesis that some
    combination of causes accounted for the failure of the TBM, on the evidence
    before him these necessarily related, not to some external causative event,
    but to the TBM itself.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the design of the TBM was modified after the failure to protect the sealing
    system against the effects of excess differential deflection.  In contrast,
    in <i>Foundation</i>, when the dam was rebuilt after the blow-in, no alterations
    to its design were made.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is also useful to contrast <i>Foundation</i> with <i>Algonquin, </i>upon
    which the insurers rely.  In <i>Algonquin</i>, the trial judge held that
    an exclusion for “faulty, inadequate or defective design” applied to losses
    occasioned when a hydroelectric dam was damaged by hydraulic piping, that
    is, by the development of pipes or channels leading to soil erosion and the
    formation of sinkholes.  She found that the risk of such damage was well
    known in the industry, that the dam “did not fulfill the purpose for which
    it was intended; it was not designed to take into account the foreseeable
    risk of piping” (at para. 182), and that faulty design was the cause of the
    failure of the dam (at para. 200).  Thus, the type of risk that materialized
    in <i>Algonquin</i>, unlike the type of risk that occurred in <i>Foundation</i>,
    was not unexpected, rare or unknown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Like <i>Algonquin</i>,
    the type of risk that materialized in this case – the risk that the TBM’s
    protective seal gap could be compromised by differential deflection leading
    to corruption of the critical main bearing – was known.  Furthermore, by
    virtue of the analyses that it had conducted or commissioned, Lovat believed
    that this known risk was adequately addressed by the design of the TBM.  Thus,
    the type of risk at issue here was both foreseeable and foreseen.  As it
    happened, Lovat was mistaken in its opinion that the TBM’s sealing system
    could withstand the differential deflection that might occur.  Consequently,
    this risk was not “accommodated” by the design of the TBM, in the sense that
    the design lacked those features or attributes necessary to meet this foreseeable
    risk.  Instead, the design of the TBM was not fit for its intended purpose
    and the failure of the TBM was the result of a foreseeable and foreseen causative
    event.  The design of the TBM, therefore, was faulty within the meaning of
    the Policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly,
    the trial judge found as a fact that “[T]he design of the TBM was deficient
    in that it was not able to perform as specified under expected or normal
    conditions” (at para. 67) and that, “Although all of the seals were not damaged,
    it is clear that the seals overall failed to perform as intended” (at para.
    15).  It is also telling, as noted by the trial judge, that Dr. Hampson himself
    acknowledged that the failure of the TBM was the result of “inherent features
    of the TBM not fulfilling their intended function” (at para. 27).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    standard of foreseeability endorsed by the trial judge required that all
    known and foreseeable risks of failure be addressed in the design of the
    TBM. This did not occur.  Instead, contrary to the findings of the trial
    judge, the design of the TBM was inadequate to meet a known risk of possible
    failure of the TBM.  We are compelled to conclude, therefore, that the design
    of the TBM was faulty and, consequently, that the faulty or improper design

lang=EN-US>Nature of insurance policy at issue</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    complete our consideration of the trial judge’s treatment of the faulty or
    improper design exclusion with this observation.  An “all risks” policy of
    property insurance, like any other insurance policy, represents an agreed
    allocation between an insurer and an insured of those risks that the insurer
    is prepared to underwrite and those that are to be borne by the insured.  Insurance
    policies of this type provide broad coverage for losses and damage to property.  But
    they do not provide coverage against all conceivable perils.  Obviously,
    were it otherwise, there would be no role for coverage exclusions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Policy here was neither a warranty that the insured property – the TBM – would
    fulfill its intended purpose, nor a warranty of entrepreneurial design risk.  With
    respect, the effect of the trial judge’s foreseeability analysis in this
    case is to convert the Policy into just such a warranty. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, we conclude that the faulty or improper design exclusion was
    made out.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(2)       Inherent Vice Exclusion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    support of their denial of coverage under the Policy, the insurers also relied
    on the exclusion in the Policy for inherent vice.  For convenience, we again
    set out the terms of this exclusion:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.         <u>EXCLUSIONS</u>: This Policy does
    not insure:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:

          Wear, tear, <i>inherent vice</i>, normal upkeep and normal making good;

    by this Policy. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the insurers had not made out the inherent vice exclusion
    because there was no evidence to support a finding of inherent vice (para.
    61).  He appeared to accept the definition of inherent vice from <i>Employers
    Casualty Co. v. Holm</i>, 393 S.W. 2d 363 (Tex. Civ. App., 1965) at 367: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN
style='color:black;'>The term
    ‘inherent vice’ as a cause of loss not covered by the policy, does not relate
    to an extraneous cause but to a loss entirely from internal decomposition
    or some quality which brings about its own injury or destruction. The vice
    must be inherent in the property for which recovery is sought.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would not disturb the trial judge’s conclusion that the insurers did not
    make out the inherent vice exclusion.  That exclusion has been interpreted
    narrowly by the courts, most recently by the British Columbia Court of Appeal
    in <i>Dawson Creek (City) v. Zurich Insurance Co. </i>(2000), 75 B.C.L.R.
    (3d) 131, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2000] S.C.C.A. No. 217.  In
    that case, the insured sought compensation for damages caused by collapse
    of the roof of an arena.  The evidence showed that the collapse was due to
    the combination of weakness of the structure from faulty construction and
    the snow load on the day of the collapse.  The snow load was not out of the
    ordinary.  Relying on <i>C.C.R. Fishing Ltd. v. British Reserve Insurance
    Co.</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 814, a marine insurance case, the court held that
    the loss fell within the policy because it would not have occurred but for
    the faulty construction which was “fortuitous in that it was not to be expected
    in the ordinary course of things” (<i>Dawson Creek</i> at para. 36).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>C.C.R., </i>the
    marine policy excluded loss from “inherent vice or nature of the subject
    matter insured”.  In that case, a ship sank either because someone had left
    a valve open or because repairers had used the wrong type of cap screws,
    which had corroded.  Justice McLachlin held that even if the loss was due
    solely to the corroded cap screws, this was not inherent vice.  She said
    the following at p. 821:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=loose1><i><span lang=EN style='color:black;'>The
          concept of inherent vice in the context of marine insurance refers
          to loss stemming from qualities inherent in the thing lost</span></i></span><span
class=loose1><span lang=EN style='color:black;'>. The failure of the cap screws
          in the case at bar cannot be said to result from purely inherent qualities
          of the ship. The unfortunate installation of these parts in the ship
          was a result of the negligence of the repairers, an external cause
          unrelated to those qualities. The loss was fortuitous, in the sense
          that it was not the inevitable product of a quality inherent in the
          vessel. [Emphasis added.]</span></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other
    cases have given a similarly narrow interpretation to inherent vice.  For
    example, <i>Soya G.m.b.H Mainz Kommanditgesellschaft v. White</i>, [1983]
    1 Lloyd’s L.R. 122 (H.L.) at 126:
    “It means the risk of deterioration of the goods shipped as a result of their
    natural behaviour in the ordinary course of the contemplated voyage without
    the intervention of any fortuitous external accident or casualty.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    inherent vice refers to some internal decomposition that made deterioration
    of the thing inevitable because of qualities inherent in the TBM.  The insurers
    adduced no evidence to that effect, and simply relied on the inference to
    be drawn from the fact that the TBM failed.  They argued, in effect, that
    since the TBM failed under normal conditions there must have been some inherent
    defect, if the failure was not the result of faulty or improper design.  The
    burden was on the insurers to prove the inherent vice exclusion.  The trial
    judge was not prepared to draw the conclusion, simply from the failure of
    the TBM, that the failure was due to inherent vice.  Given the narrow interpretation
    of the inherent vice exclusion, we cannot find that the trial judge erred
    in this approach, given his finding that the cause was excess differential
    deflection.</p>

      p. 47, quoted with approval in <i>Algonquin, supra</i> at paras. 175 – 77
      and 179 that the finding of a design error or a defective design may, but
      need not, depend upon a showing of designer negligence.  In this case,
      on its face, the faulty or improper design exclusion is concerned with
      shortcomings in the attributes or character of the insured property itself,
      as designed, rather than the conduct of the designer.  </span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[I]f the design of the structure

      the trial judge’s finding that this occurred due to excess differential
      deflection.  We have already concluded that the risk of excess differential
      deflection compromising of the TBM’s sealing system was known to and investigated
      by Lovat or its agents when the TBM was designed.  Thus, in contrast to
      the facts in <i>Foundation</i> but like the facts in <i>Algonquin</i>,
      the causative risk of failure in this case was not only reasonably foreseeable,

      the TBM’s sealing system “failed to perform as intended” (at para. 15).  Thus,
      this case involves a design of insured property that was insufficient to
      permit the insured property to function for its intended purpose, after
      the investigation of a known and predictable potential peril but the failure

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[134]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    their cross-appeal, the CN companies submit that the trial judge erred by
    holding that if the exclusion for faulty or improper design applied, they
    could not recover for resultant loss or damage.  This submission turns on
    the exception to the faulty or improper design exclusion set out in clause
    3(d)(iii) of the Policy:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.         <u>EXCLUSIONS</u>: This Policy does

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[135]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    CN companies argue that if any resultant loss or damage is insured under
    any other parts of the Policy, they are entitled to recover for that loss
    or damage.  For example, they point to Section II of the Policy, which insures
    against loss resulting from delay beyond the scheduled start-up date caused
    by “a peril insured against under Section I of this Policy”.  They claim
    that the interaction between Sections I and II permits them to claim damages
    caused by the delayed start-up that resulted from the faulty or improper
    design of the TBM.  The trial judge rejected this argument.  He held as follows
    at para. 99:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=loose1><span
lang=EN style='color:black;'>In my view, this provision must be construed to

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[136]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    CN companies point out that the resultant loss or damage clause is worded
    differently from clauses of this type considered by the courts of this country.  One
    of the leading cases, and a case relied upon by the trial judge, is <i>British
    Columbia v. Royal Insurance Co. of Canada </i>(1991), 60 B.C.L.R. (2d) 109
    (C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [1991] S.C.C.A. No. 506.  In that
    case, the relevant clause read as follows:</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN>This policy does not insure</span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span lang=EN>(a)(i) faulty or improper material;<br>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[137]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    unlike this case, which uses the phrase
    “resultant loss or damage under any Section of this Policy”, in <i>Royal
    Insurance</i> the policy referred to
    “resultant damage to the property”.  The CN companies submit that by using
    the words “under any Section of this Policy”
    and omitting the words “to the property”, the parties eliminated the requirement
    that there must be damage to other property.  Rather, resultant damage under
    any section of the Policy, such as delayed opening, is covered.  The CN companies
    argue that the trial judge, in effect, erred by inserting the words “to the
    property” after the word
    “damage” in clause 3(d)(iii) of the Policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[138]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the trial judge that the resulting loss or damage exception to
    the faulty or improper design exclusion does not provide coverage.  The CN
    companies’ submission ignores the basic structure of the Policy.  Section
    I of the Policy insures against all risks of “direct physical loss or damage” subject
    to the exclusions in clause 3.  One of those exclusions is “the cost of making
    good…faulty or improper design”.  We have found that the loss or damage to
    the TBM was the result of faulty or improper design, which comes within the
    exclusion in clause 3(d)(iii).  This physical loss or damage is not otherwise
    insured under any other part of the Policy.  Therefore, by reason of the
    exclusion of the peril for faulty or improper design, there is no “peril
    insured against under Section I” within the meaning of Section II of the
    Policy.  As a result, there is no coverage, for example, for the loss or
    damage caused by the delayed start-up, within the resulting loss or damage
    exception to the faulty or improper design exclusion.  We agree with the
    insurers that the delayed opening insurance under Section II provides coverage
    for consequential economic loss only to the extent that the economic loss
    results from insured loss or damage to insured property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[139]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not agree that this interpretation renders the exception in clause 3(d)(iii)
    meaningless.  The insurers provide an example.  If the faulty design of the
    TBM had caused a fire that damaged the TBM and part of the tunnel constructed
    behind it, the damage to the TBM would be excluded, as would any economic
    loss from delayed opening due to the damage to the TBM.  However, the physical
    damage to the tunnel itself, which was insured property, would be covered,
    as would any economic loss from delayed opening attributable to the damage
    to the tunnel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[140]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    a slight variation on this submission, the CN companies maintain that the
    faulty or improper design exclusion applies only to the cost of making good
    the faulty design and not to the peril of faulty design.  To put this submission
    in concrete terms, the CN companies assert that the only cost excluded is
    the cost incurred by Lovat for the inspection, repair and modification of
    the TBM cuttinghead.  The trial judge rejected this submission.  As he said
    at para. 81,
    “[T]he exclusion must be intended to apply to all loss or damage caused by
    faulty or improper design and is not limited to the costs incurred in repairing
    or modifying the faulty or improper design of the TBM.”  The trial judge
    analyzed the two American decisions upon which the CN companies relied and
    upon which they rely in this court.  We agree entirely with the trial judge’s
    complete analysis at paras. 78 – 94 of his reasons for judgment.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(3)       Sue and Labour and

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[141]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    CN companies also rely upon the sue and labour provision in Section IV of
    the Policy.  As we indicated earlier, clause 16 of Section IV provides that
    in case of loss or damage “it shall be lawful and necessary for the Insured…to
    sue, labour and travel for in and about the defence, safeguard and recovery
    of the property insured hereunder” and “the Insurer(s) will contribute…towards
    any reasonable and proper expenses in connection with the foregoing”.  The
    CN companies submit that this clause provides coverage for the expense of
    digging the vertical shaft and extracting the TBM, being costs necessarily
    incurred to prevent any further damage to the property.  For example, they
    argue that if the TBM had continued to tunnel and failed under the St. Clair
    River, this would have caused irreparable damage to the tunnel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[142]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    CN companies make a similar submission in relation to Statutory Condition
    9, which requires the insured to “take all reasonable steps to prevent further
    damage to any such property so damaged and to prevent damage to other property
    insured hereunder”.  Statutory Condition 9 requires the insurer to contribute
    toward any reasonable and proper expenses in connection with the steps taken
    by the insured.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[143]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In

    Insurance Co. et al. v. Benson &amp; Hedges (Canada) Ltd.</i>, [1978] 2 S.C.R.
    1088 determines these issues against the CN companies.  Speaking for the
    majority at p. 1102, Pratte J. held that these clauses cover mitigation of
    damage resulting
    “from the contingency that has occurred as opposed to being the consequence
    of another contingency that has yet to occur”.  Further, as Lang J. said
    in <i>Algonquin Power, supra </i>at para. 154:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=loose1><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[144]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,

    their cross-appeal, the CN companies also argue that the tunnel was physically
    damaged and that this constitutes direct physical loss under Section I of
    the Policy.  This submission is based on the theory that while the tunnel
    was blocked by the TBM it could not function as a tunnel.  The trial judge
    fully dealt with this argument at paras. 100 – 108 of his reasons and we
    agree with his analysis.  As he said at para. 105: “[T]he positioning of
    the TBM in the tunnel was not a fortuitous event but was clearly a deliberate
    act taken in the course of construction of the tunnel.  Such deliberate act
    does not…constitute a risk of direct physical loss or damage to insured property
    for which coverage is provided under the Policy.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[146]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    as the insurers point out, the interpretation of this part of Section I is
    assisted by reference to clause 3(a), which provides that the Policy does
    not insure “any loss of use or occupancy howsoever caused except as specifically
    stated”.  Thus, the Policy itself distinguishes between direct physical loss
    or damage and loss of use.  Loss of use of the tunnel is addressed in Section
    II, which deals with expenses for delayed opening.  But, as we have already
    said, by reason of the exclusion of coverage for faulty or improper design,
    the coverage in Section II is not triggered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[147]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore,

    have had the opportunity to read the thorough and careful reasons of my colleagues.  In
    particular, I have read the reasons explaining their conclusion that the
    trial judge erred in fact and in law in his decision interpreting and applying
    the faulty design exclusion contained in this “all-risks” insurance policy.  Respectfully,
    I am unable to agree with their analysis.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, this case turns primarily on the interpretation and application
    of the faulty design exclusion and the onus on the insurer to prove that
    exclusion.  Subject to one clarification, in my view, the trial judge interpreted
    and applied the test correctly. Since the insurers failed to satisfy the
    onus on them to establish the exclusion, I would dismiss the appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[152]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    was a complex case that consumed nineteen days of trial time.  The trial
    judge reserved judgment for more than five months and wrote 176 paragraphs
    of reasons supporting his conclusion.  It is apparent that the trial judge
    had an excellent understanding of the technical facts and the considerable
    scientific evidence presented at trial.  In my view, the trial judge’s factual
    findings are supported by the evidence and are entitled to deference. To
    the extent that my colleagues find that the trial judge misapprehended certain
    evidence, I cannot agree. However, even if I accepted the errors found by
    my colleagues, in my view, those errors would not change the result.</p>

'><span style='color:black;'>[153]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Regarding
    the appropriate test, in my view, the governing standard is that adopted
    by this court in <i>Foundation Co. of Canada Ltd. v. American Home Assurance
    Co.</i> (1995),  25 O.R. (3d) 36 (Gen. Div.), aff’d [1997] O.J. No. 2332
    (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  That standard requires the designer to take all foreseeable risks into
    account. As was stated in <i>Foundation</i>,<i> </i>the resolution of this
    issue necessitates a comparative analysis of the design under attack against
    some standard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[154]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    in my view, my colleagues’ reasons alter the <i>Foundation</i> standard in
    two important ways. First, the standard as formulated in their reasons requires
    not only that all foreseeable risks be taken into account in the design,
    but also that the design succeed in accommodating those risks. Second, their
    reasons do not consider the essential comparative component of the <i>Foundation </i>test.
    In making these two alterations to the standard, my colleagues adopt a standard
    that is significantly closer to the results-focused standard set out in <i>Queensland</i> <i>Government
    Railways and Electric Power Transmission Pty., Ltd. v. Manufacturers’ Mutual
    Insurance Ltd. </i>(1968),<i> </i>[1969] 1 Lloyd’s L.R. 214 (H.C.A.). The

'>[155]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regarding
    the application of the standard to the facts of this case, as I read his
    reasons, particularly at para. 76, the trial judge found that the insured
    machine was designed to take into account all foreseeable risks. The insured
    assembled a world-wide committee of experts to determine and approve the
    conceptual design for the machine and a second committee of experts to oversee
    its manufacture.  To this end, the insured then contracted with a very experienced
    manufacturer, Lovat Tunnel Equipment Inc., (Lovat) that had successfully
    manufactured 124 other tunnel boring machines, none of which experienced
    the failure that occurred in this case.  The manufacturer, who was responsible
    for the structural integrity of the machine, undertook analyses to ensure
    that the design took into account all foreseeable risks. The trial judge
    did not accept any evidence called by the insurer that indicated that any
    further steps should have been taken in the design process to forestall the
    risk that materialized. Accordingly, as I understand the evidence and the
    trial judge’s reasons, all foreseeable risks were taken into account. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[156]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    turn first to a consideration of the law, which in my view, is the crux of
    this appeal. On the law, the CN companies (CN) argued that the trial judge
    properly applied the foreseeability test adopted by this court in <i>Foundation</i>.
    Although the insurers’ oral argument, in contrast to their factum, focused
    on the application of the test, from my perspective, the test must be correct
    before it can be applied to the relevant facts. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly,
    the trial judge was mindful of and thoroughly considered the general principles
    applicable to the interpretation of an insurance contract.  He recognized
    that, once the insured proves the loss, the onus shifts to the insurer “to
    establish on a balance of probabilities that the loss comes within an exclusion
    in the policy”.  The trial judge also noted that “exclusion provisions are
    to be construed narrowly against the insurer.”  The trial judge appreciated
    that, when faced with ambiguity, such as the meaning of faulty design, a
    court should seek an interpretation consistent with commercial reality and
    the true intent of the parties in accordance with the purpose of the coverage
    and of the exclusion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[159]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    recognized that coverage is only provided for fortuitous losses in the sense
    of being random or unexpected and that, accordingly, there is no coverage
    for losses flowing from ordinary wear and tear or from the inevitable degradation
    of the object insured.  The same principle negates coverage for losses wilfully
    caused by the insured.  This is because insurance protects against risks,
    not certainties.  However, a policy may provide coverage for losses arising
    from the insured’s negligence, such as liability insurance. See <i>Consolidated
    Bathurst Export Ltd. v. Mutual Boiler and Machinery Insurance Co. </i>(1979),
    [1980] 1 S.C.R. 888; Craig Brown, <i>Introduction to Canadian Insurance Law</i>,

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[161]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    pre-conditions were essential to CN’s tunnel project.  First, CN needed a
    tunnel boring machine that would dig a very large tunnel.  Second, CN needed
    insurance to protect it in case that machine failed, the tunnel collapsed,
    or some other calamity befell the project.  In negotiating the $890,000 premium
    for this large-scale tunnelling project, the insurers and the insured recognized
    that the two primary risks were the potential failure of the TBM and of the
    tunnel or its lining.  Because the risks were high, and the potential losses
    significant, the risk was spread among six insurers. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[162]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CN
    was worried about and investigated the risks of this project. Relevant to
    the risk that manifested in this case, Klohn Leonoff, a specialized engineering
    firm retained by CN, commented on the TBM proposal at the time the contract
    was signed in 1992.  Those comments referred to “Unexpected Events”, including “Failure
    of Main Bearing”.  The relevant comment said that such a failure is “feared” because
    the consequences would be expensive.  The comments refer to the need for
    elasticity in the seals given the larger diameter of this TBM and refer to
    solving the problem by arranging the two groups of seals in different directions,
    as implemented by Lovat.  In addition, the insurers were aware that the main
    bearing was the piece of equipment most likely to fail and that the main
    bearing was “the critical component because it is exposed to the bored material
    first and thus most susceptible to damage.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[163]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With

    policy agreed upon, which CN bought in March 1993, not only insured against
    specific perils such as fire and flood, but against all risks, including
    soil conditions and the mechanical breakdown of the TBM.  As such, it provided
    extremely broad coverage, subject only to the specified exclusions, such
    as the faulty design exclusion and the custom exclusions required by the
    insurers. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[165]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Specifically,
    the policy provided coverage for “ALL RISKS of direct physical loss or damage…to…all…property…including
    but not limited to the tunnel boring machine”, as well as the structures,
    tunnels and materials used during construction.  The TBM was the key and
    most expensive element of this project and was recognized as such by the
    insurers. As I have said, the risk of main bearing failure from exposure
    to bored material, which I take to include soil, was explicitly considered
    by the insurers. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[166]<span

    addition to the faulty design exclusion, the insurance contract contained
    carefully considered exclusions commensurate with what the insurer saw as
    the unacceptable risks.  For example, the insurers specifically excluded
    coverage for mechanical breakdown.  However, this exclusion was limited to
    the mechanical breakdown of “any belt, screen, grinding and/or cutting blade,
    disc or surface, or any wear plate or mantle which forms part of any machine”. </p>

    policy also excluded certain risks specific to the tunnel boring machine,
    including depletion, deterioration, corrosion, wear and tear and the leakage
    of particular named parts of the machine – none of which were at issue in
    this case.  Importantly, the insurers did not exclude the risk of leakage

    Wilson J. explained her reasons for rejecting a standard of reasonable foreseeability
    at p. 47: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The departure from the test of negligence as a

    and I accept it. It would be too easy for design standards to slip, and be

    in that it was unlikely further tests, such as another bore hole, “would
    have identified the potential problem”, and thus all foreseeable risks had
    been taken into account in the cofferdam’s design.  She found no fault with
    the design, but only that the design had been unable to withstand the unforeseeable
    risk.  She reasoned that in these circumstances, to exclude coverage when

  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>I pause to note that a finding of faulty or
    defective design is <u>necessarily comparative</u>. <u>It means comparing
    the design in question to some standard</u>, and <u>requires a finding that
    the design was below that standard</u>. The issue of whether the standard
    in the industry is the appropriate one is at the heart of the dilemma of

    there will be an overlap between the standard imposed for faulty design and
    the standard of negligence. However the two tests are not necessarily identical.

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[185]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I read my colleagues’ reasons, they do not compare the conduct of the designer
    to any standard and they conclude that the faulty design exclusion relates
    to the “shortcomings in the attributes or character of the property itself,
    as designed, rather than the conduct of the designer.” The critical part
    of my colleagues’ reasoning is found at para. 114 of their reasons, which
    states: </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>As it happened, Lovat was mistaken in its opinion
    that the TBM’s sealing system could withstand the differential deflection
    that might occur. Consequently, this risk was not ‘accommodated’ by the design
    of the TBM, in the sense that the design lacked those features or attributes
    necessary to meet this foreseeable risk. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[186]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the same vein, my colleagues refer to the “inadequacy of the measures taken
    to address or accommodate [excess differential deflection] in the design
    of the TBM”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[187]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    me, these extracts, and my colleagues’ reasons generally, set a standard
    akin to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <i>Queensland</i>, which I cannot accept as the governing standard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[188]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    deal first with the adoption of “accommodate” as an added element to the <i>Foundation </i>standard.  This
    addition originated with the trial judge, who used the term in his reasons
    when he stated, “I adopt the reasons of Wilson J. in <i>Foundation</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    and Lang J. in <i>Algonquin, supra</i>, and conclude that the law of Ontario
    is that the standard to be applied to determine whether a design was faulty
    or improper is that insured property must be designed so that it <u>accommodates</u> all
    foreseeable risks”. [Emphasis added.]  As pointed out by my colleagues, in
    other paragraphs of his reasons, the trial judge uses “provide” and “designed
    to withstand”, both to the same effect. The problem with this language is
    that neither <i>Foundation</i> nor <i>Algonquin</i> used these terms in delineating
    the standard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[189]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the trial judge simply misspoke when he used these words rather
    than
    “take into account”.  I say this for four reasons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[190]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    I conclude that “accommodate” was unintentional because the trial judge substituted
    that word or “provide” in the foreseeability standard without explanation.  In
    my view, had he intended to change the standard so significantly, he would
    have explained his reasons for doing so. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[191]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    in stating that the insured property must be designed to accommodate all
    foreseeable risks, the trial judge indicated that he was adopting the standard
    set out in <i>Foundation </i>and <i>Algonquin</i>, neither of which employs
    the word “accommodate”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[192]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    in the same sentence that incorporates “accommodate”, the trial judge specifically
    confirms his rejection of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    <i>Queensland</i> standard.  A standard of failure to
    “accommodate” would be very close to the results-focused<i>
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Queensland</i> standard, which has been rejected by this court. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[193]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    the addition of the word “accommodate” is inconsistent with the trial judge’s
    application of the standard to the facts of this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[194]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    in my view, the trial judge did not intend to change the standard. Such a
    high standard that looks only at outcome, without any consideration of the
    conduct of the designer, would ignore principles of interpretation that require
    a narrow construction of exclusions and would result in an interpretation
    that significantly raises the bar in favour of the insurer.  I say this because,
    if a design is required to succeed in accommodating all foreseeable risks,
    as my colleagues say it must, then the design is required to meet a standard
    of perfection with respect to those risks. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[195]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rather,
    in my view, the governing standard only requires the insured to take all
    foreseeable risks into account.  This is consistent with the <i>Foundation</i> standard
    that calls for a comparative analysis, an analysis that considers the human
    component of the design, and asks what the designer anticipated, or should
    have anticipated, would be the risks arising from the design and whether
    the designer took those risks into account.  If the insurer can show, on
    a balance of probabilities, that the designer failed to meet this standard,
    the insurer will have succeeded in proving the exclusion. If the insurer
    fails to meet that onus, the insured is entitled to coverage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[196]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    foreseeability standard is more favourable to the insurer than the reasonable
    foreseeability standard because it sets a higher standard to which the design
    must conform. At the same time, the foreseeability standard achieves the
    goal of providing insurance coverage commensurate with the designer and the
    insured’s reasonable expectations.  It also ensures that an insurer is not
    required to compensate an insured for any shoddy design or cost-cutting measures
    employed by the designer, even if those measures met industry standards.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[197]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    the foreseeability standard strikes a fair balance in respect of allocation
    of risk. While such a test imposes a high standard on the insured, it is
    not as high as the standard of perfection implicit in “accommodation”. Under
    my colleagues’ standard, designers and their customers could be discouraged
    from undertaking innovative projects if faced with exclusion from coverage
    on a results-focused basis, irrespective of the diligence exercised in achieving
    the design. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[198]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, it is unnecessary to delineate the precise comparative standard
    because there was no evidence accepted by the trial judge that any other
    designer would have undertaken any different analysis and the facts support
    a finding that Lovat was a most prudent designer.  There is a broad spectrum
    of conduct between that of a negligent designer and one who meets the most
    exacting of standards.  The precise location of the standard on that spectrum
    is best determined on the appropriate factual foundation. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>Application of the standard</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[199]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    my reading of the trial judge’s reasons, he properly applied the correct
    standard and found that the designer of the TBM took into account all foreseeable
    risks. On the facts of this case, the designer recognized the risk of EDD
    and its potential to start a domino effect leading to main bearing failure.
    For this reason, it undertook all precautions to exclude the risk in the
    design and manufacture of the TBM. The structural integrity of the cuttinghead
    design was confirmed by the Wardrop and Lovat analyses. The Wardrop analyses
    provided detailed highly sophisticated computerized calculations of the anticipated
    deflection of the relevant components. The Lovat overlay exercise used those
    calculations to determine the degree to which those components would deflect
    towards each other (differential deflection). On the basis of these analyses,
    Lovat was satisfied that differential deflection would not exceed permitted
    tolerances so as to put at risk the effectiveness of the sealing system.
    In that way, Lovat accounted for the foreseeable risk of EDD in its design. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[200]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s finding that the Wardrop and Lovat analyses took into account
    the risk of deflection and differential deflection respectively was supported
    by the evidence.  The Wardrop analyses were available at trial, including
    the detailed data provided for those analyses by Lovat.  The insurers were
    unable to point to any error in those analyses.  While the results of the
    subsequent Lovat overlay analysis were not recorded, there was no evidence
    that the analysis was conducted other than thoroughly and correctly.  Importantly,
    the insurers, on whom the onus lay, called no evidence from an expert with
    credentials similar to those of Dr. Hampson, CN’s expert, to show that the
    key Wardrop analysis was based on faulty data or that an overlay analysis
    conducted differently would have revealed that the design was at risk of
    EDD.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[201]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
    the trial judge accepted that the analyses undertaken established that the
    cuttinghead and seal design, including the allowance for differential deflection,
    would meet the purpose of protecting the seals. Further, Wardrop indicated
    that it anticipated that the results of any additional finite element analysis “with
    the addition of the cuttinghead and thrust bearing” would reflect increased
    structural integrity of the bearing plate area. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[202]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    design, including allowances for differential deflection, was tried and true.
    The TBM had been designed to withstand greater pressures than those present
    in this project and, as found by the trial judge at para. 75, “the sealing
    system used had been proven at pressures greater than those encountered in
    the St. Clair River Tunneling Project.” Dr. Hampson’s expert evidence supported
    the trial judge’s conclusion that the <i>Foundation</i> standard was met.
    There was no evidence accepted by the trial judge that any other designer
    would have undertaken any more or different tests. In addition, a similar
    design worked in 124 earlier tunnel boring machines manufactured by Lovat. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[203]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge preferred Dr. Hampson’s evidence to that of Dr. Becker, the insurers’ expert,
    on the issue of foreseeability. As the trial judge noted, Dr. Hampson’s qualifications
    were significantly more relevant to the issues than were Dr. Becker’s. Dr.
    Becker was an expert only in structural engineering and failure investigation,
    with no expertise in tribology, seals, tunnelling or tunnel boring machines.
    Dr. Hampson not only had a particular expertise in tribology – the science
    of lubrication, friction and wear as it applies to components such as bearings,
    seals and gears – but also specific experience with sealing problems in tunnel
    boring machines.  In addition, as found by the trial judge, Dr. Hampson was
    an expert “in the fields of methodology for failure investigation for mechanical
    equipment; performance of machines in hostile environments; extending life
    and performance of industrial plant; design audit… and machine condition
    monitoring”. In my view, it was open to the trial judge to accept Dr. Hampson’s
    evidence on the critical issue of whether the design took all foreseeable
    risks into account and to reject Dr. Becker’s opinion concerning the advisability
    of an annular ring or the need to provide for <i>in situ</i> repairs. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[204]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
    colleagues refer to the post-breakdown modifications. In my view, these modifications
    do not serve to distinguish <i>Foundation</i> and cannot serve as evidence
    that the risk was not taken into account, particularly in light of the expert
    evidence to the contrary. On this point, the trial judge accepted Dr. Hampson’s
    evidence that the modifications could not have been anticipated as important
    to the original design and that there was no indication that the original
    design “was constrained by cost or that corners were cut” in any way.  Accordingly,
    the success of remedial measures undertaken post-breakdown cannot inform
    whether the breakdown was foreseeable at the relevant time. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[205]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
    colleagues also distinguish <i>Foundation</i> on the basis that the cofferdam’s
    failure in that case occurred as a result of external causes, while the cause
    of soil contamination in this case was internal to the design.  In my view,
    there should not be a different result for unforeseeable internal causes
    than for unforeseeable external causes.  As in <i>Foundation</i>, it was
    unlikely in this case that further tests would have identified the potential
    problem. Since, in both this case and in <i>Foundation</i>, the insured took
    into account all foreseeable risks, the standard was met.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[206]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
    the trial judge’s interpretation of this exclusion is consistent with the
    other terms of this custom-made policy because the insurers were aware of
    the risks surrounding the TBM, could have excluded the risk that materialized
    and chose not to do so.  In particular, the insurers chose not to list the
    bearing or the seals under either the mechanical breakdown exclusion or under
    the excluded components of the TBM. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[207]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge’s interpretation and application of the standard in this
    case is consistent with the onus on the insurer to prove the exclusion and
    with the principle of interpreting exclusion clauses narrowly and in keeping
    with the purpose for which the insurance was acquired.  To interpret “faulty
    design,” an ambiguous term, as meaning any design defect, whether that defect
    was sufficiently taken into account or not, would run contrary to the reasonable
    expectations of the parties.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[208]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary, it was open to the trial judge to accept Dr. Hampson’s evidence
    and to conclude that the design of the TBM contemplated and accounted for
    differential</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>deflection and EDD.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span

    a final point, I do not agree with my colleagues that the trial judge misapprehended
    the evidence or made any “processing” errors. However, I have not found it

    relied upon by my colleagues, the insurers failed to meet the onus on them

    a separate action against Lovat for damages, CN alleged that the machine’s
    breakdown was caused by Lovat’s failure to design the cuttinghead with sufficient
    rigidity to avoid EDD.  The parties attempted to settle that action. An essential
    term was that Lovat would buy the TBM back from CN.  Immediately before the
    parties reached their final settlement, Lovat increased its offer by $440,000.  That
    offer was accepted by CN.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[213]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    view of this settlement, the trial judge deducted $440,000 from the amount
    the insurers were required to pay CN under the policy because he accepted
    the insurers’ argument that CN would otherwise achieve double recovery; CN
    was not entitled to both its full claim against the insurers and the $440,000
    paid by Lovat that could reasonably be attributed to the buy-back of the
    TBM. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[214]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    its cross-appeal, CN challenges this finding on three bases. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[215]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    CN argues that there was no evidentiary foundation for the finding that Lovat’s
    payment was attributable to the settlement of CN’s action against Lovat. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[216]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    in my view, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary and in light of
    the surrounding circumstances, the trial judge was entitled to draw the inference
    that the increase in the Lovat settlement reflected an amount that both Lovat
    and CN attributed as compensation to CN for its claim.  Indeed, the trial
    judge found that the $440,000 was the minimum amount that could be attributed
    for this purpose.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[217]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    I am unable to agree with CN’s submission that the insurers are not entitled
    to subrogate against this recovery until CN has fully recovered all its losses,
    as opposed to a full recovery of its entitlement under the insurance policy.  In
    other words, CN argues that even if the insurers fully satisfy its insurance
    claim, CN is not fully indemnified because it still has losses, for example,
    by reason of the policy’s thirty-day waiting period for the delayed opening,
    by reason of the policy deductible, and by reason of the costs CN incurred
    in effecting its recovery from the insurers. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[218]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the trial judge pointed out, CN specifically contracted for a thirty-day
    waiting period with respect to delayed opening expenses, as well as for the
    policy’s deductible.  Either one of these expenses exceeds the $440,000 at
    issue. In effect, CN self-insured for these losses and it is not entitled
    to apply against them the $440,000 it received from Lovat. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[219]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the insurers do not dispute CN’s argument that it is not fully indemnified
    under the policy until it has recovered legal costs incurred in pursuing
    recovery against the third party, Lovat.  However, since CN led no evidence
    about those costs, an appropriate credit cannot be calculated. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[220]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CN
    provided no authority to support its secondary argument that it should also
    be able to offset its costs incurred in pursuing recovery from the insurers
    against the monies received from Lovat.  In any event, I am unable to accept
    this argument because to do so would undermine any incentive by an insured
    to control litigation costs in pursuing its insurer. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>Costs</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[221]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CN
    challenges the trial judge’s award of costs on two bases: first, that the
    trial judge erred in decreasing CN’s claimed costs by more than forty per
    cent based on the reasonable expectations principle, and, second, that the
    trial judge erred in denying CN a second counsel fee for a case that was
    admittedly complex.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[222]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In

    to the “overriding principle of reasonableness”.  In this circumstance, even
    taking into account the heavier burdens placed on a plaintiff to prepare
    its case, the trial judge did not err in taking into consideration the fact
    that CN’s costs for trial preparation far exceeded those of the insurers.  It
    cannot be said that the trial judge exercised a wrong principle in applying
    his significant experience to the circumstances of the case and in reducing
    the costs to $1,150,837.35 ($800,000 of which was for fees).</p>

    challenges the trial judge’s decision to average the prejudgment interest
    rate payable on this claim. In this case, the difference between the average
    rate and the rate set out in the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. C. 43, did not fluctuate by more than three percent between the date of
    the claim and the date of judgment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, <i>Graham v. Rourke</i> (1990), 74 D.L.R. (4th) 1 (Ont. C.A.) does
    not set down an inflexible rule precluding an averaging of rates in all circumstances
    where the fluctuation is less than four percent and for that reason cannot
    be said to be “significant”.  Indeed, the fluctuation of the interest rate
    is only one factor under s. 130(1)(b) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>,
    which provides a court with the discretion to “vary” the relevant rate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[228]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, there were other factors to consider, particularly the lengthy
    delay between the denial of coverage in August 1995 and the commencement
    of the trial in February 2004.  In these circumstances, the averaging of
    prejudgment interest was within the discretion of the trial judge.  I see
    no error to justify interfering with his exercise of that discretion. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a secondary issue on this ground, CN argues that the trial judge erred in
    deciding that interest would commence on the date coverage was refused (August
    23, 1995) rather than on the date the proof of loss for coverage was filed <span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New Roman"'>(March 1, 1995).</span> The
    insurers did not respond to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    policy specifically provides that “adjusted claims … shall be due and payable
    no more than thirty (30) days after presentation and acceptance of proofs
    of interest and loss at the office of the Insurer(s).”  On its face, the
    adjusted claims were payable by the insurers to CN by March 31.  Accordingly,
    I would allow the cross-appeal in this respect and set March 31, 1995 as
    the date for commencement of prejudgment interest.</p>

    their cross-appeal, the CN companies maintain that the trial judge erred
    by failing to employ a reasonable foreseeability standard in his interpretation
    of the faulty or improper design exclusion.  They submit that this exclusion
    contemplates that where the designer of insured property has undertaken everything
    that could reasonably be expected in the preparation of the design of the
    insured property, the design cannot be said to be “faulty” or “improper” and
    the exclusion does not apply.</p>

    a standard of foreseeability to the construction of the exclusion, the trial
    judge in <i>Foundation</i> held that the design of the cofferdam was fit
    for its intended purpose and that the blow-in was not foreseeable.  Consequently,
    the design of the dam was not
    “faulty” and the exclusion did not apply.  An appeal from that decision was
    dismissed by this court without discussion of the content of the standard
    of foreseeability applied by the trial judge.</p>

    deflection describes the deflection of two adjacent structures as they move

    (EDD) was used in this proceeding to describe the deflection of the two structures

    cuttinghead and the static bulkhead.  The cuttinghead cut the soil ahead

    note that the trial judge’s reasons, particularly at para. 76, contain an
    apparent inconsistency to the extent that the trial judge says both the risk
    was taken into account and the risk was not foreseeable. While I am aware
    that these two statements appear inconsistent, in my view the trial judge
    only said that the risk was not foreseeable in the sense that it was no longer
    foreseeable because the design had taken it into account. In any event, I
    do not believe this apparent inconsistency has any bearing on the result
    of this appeal, as the record and the trial judge’s findings clearly support
    the conclusion he reached with respect to the application of the correct
    standard: the design took into account all foreseeable risks. </p>
