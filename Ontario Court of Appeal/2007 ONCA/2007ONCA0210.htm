    appellant father, Brian Somerville, appeals from the judgment of Borkovich
    J., which awarded sole custody of the two children (now six and three-and-a-half
    years of age) to the respondent mother, Michelle Somerville, and did not
    deal with the issue of the appellant’s access to the access to the children.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After
      ten years of marriage, the parties separated in February 2003.  At the
      time, the respondent was pregnant with the parties’ second child.  In May
      2003, the parties entered into a separation agreement, which provided for
      shared custody with the children residing equal amounts of time at each
      party’s residence. As well, it provided for consultation regarding matters
      affecting the children.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      July 2004, the appellant brought an application for divorce, custody and
      child support.  Pending trial, the interim order of Glithero J. provided
      for a shared parenting arrangement with a schedule of rotating residences
      for the children.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, although each parent was content with a shared custody regime, each
    sought to gain primary residence of the children because they found their
    existing arrangement of two days with one parent followed by two days with
    the other to be too disruptive for the children.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to seeking primary residence, the appellant sought to have the final
    decision on significant matters affecting the children. On this issue, the
    respondent suggested that such matters could be resolved through mediation,
    since the parties had resolved other disagreements this way in the past.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Trial decision</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
    the positions of the parties regarding shared custody, after a four-day trial,
    the trial judge awarded sole custody to the respondent.  He did so because
    he found the appellant to be arrogant as well as both disparaging and controlling
    of the respondent.  The trial judge was also influenced by his finding that
    the appellant had been deceitful with the respondent regarding the reasons
    that he left the marriage and, in particular, regarding his relationship
    with the woman who is now the appellant’s wife.  In contrast, the trial judge
    found the respondent to be “blameless” with respect to the break-up of the
    marriage.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the basis of the evidence from the appellant and his current wife, the trial
    judge concluded that they intended to be the children’s only family and that
    they would minimize the respondent’s involvement in the children’s lives. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    the trial judge was of the view that the appellant would not cooperate in
    a shared joint custody arrangement, he determined that such an arrangement
    would “lead to disaster and would not be in the best interests of the children.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge refused to consider the parties’
    separation agreement as a relevant factor because he found that the appellant
    induced the respondent to enter into the agreement by fraudulently holding
    out to her a false hope of reconciliation.  In any event, given the “present
    status quo” and the “passage of time”, he considered the separation agreement
    to have no relevance to the issues. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, the trial judge refused to order joint custody and instead
    awarded sole custody with primary residence to the respondent. In addition,
    he ordered that the respondent would have the right to make all important
    decisions regarding the children. The trial judge did not determine the question
    of access “to allow some time for the parties to attempt to resolve [that
    issue].”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s order was stayed pending this appeal by order of Flynn J. dated
    July 26, 2006.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is an error in principle to place undue emphasis on the conduct of a parent
    and insufficient emphasis on the children’s best interests when determining
    child custody issues. See <i>Cox v. Stephen</i>, [2003] O.J. No.  4371 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).
     In this case, the trial judge erred by focusing on the appellant’s deceit
    and his controlling conduct almost to the exclusion of the other factors
    relevant to the best interests of the children and the merits of the agreed
    equal parenting arrangements that were in place at the time of trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    reaching his decision regarding custody of the children, the trial judge
    did not address the <i>Divorce Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2<sup>nd</sup> Supp.)
    s. 16(8) factors of the “best interests of the child of the marriage as determined
    by reference to the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the
    child.” The trial judge did not review the extensive evidence given at trial
    about the children’s situation since the parties’ separation both in the
    home of the appellant and in the home of the respondent. He did not consider
    their school arrangements, their daycare arrangements, their extra-curricular
    activities, or their emotional needs and bonds with their parents and their
    caregivers.  He did not refer to the evidence about how the parties resolved,
    and failed to resolve, conflicts concerning the children in the past. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the trial judge highlighted his concerns about the appellant’s inability
    to facilitate contact with the respondent, he did not address the other s.
    16(10) factor, which requires a court to give effect to the principle that
    a child should have as much contact with each parent as is consistent with
    the child’s best interests. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    well, s. 16(9) of the <i>Divorce Act</i> specifically instructs a court to “not
    take into consideration the past conduct of any person unless the conduct
    is relevant to the ability of that person to act as a parent of a child.”  While
    the appellant’s “deceit” certainly reflected on his ability as a spouse,
    it does not follow that this is the controlling factor reflective of his
    abilities as a parent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:
normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge erred in declining to deal with the issue of access.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Result </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, the order below must be set aside.  On the basis of the record
    before this court, it is not feasible to determine what custodial terms are
    in the best interests of the children, particularly since we have not had
    the opportunity available to the trial judge to observe the parties or their
    witnesses and to draw conclusions about the family dynamics from the whole
    of the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    in my view, there must be a new trial on the issues of custody and access
    as well as the ancillary issue of child support.  Pending that trial, the
    terms of the order of Flynn J. dated July 26, 2006 shall remain in effect.
    In this way, except as varied by an order of a judge of the Superior Court
    of Justice, the parenting arrangements will be in accord with paragraph 1
    of the order of Glithero J. of November 3, 2004 and child support will be
    in accord with paragraph 2 of the order of Flynn J.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    note that the delay in releasing this decision resulted from the parties’ efforts
    to settle these issues without the need for a determination of this appeal.
    We are informed that they have been unsuccessful in reaching a settlement.
    Clearly, this matter should proceed for a new trial at the earliest available
    trial date.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs of this appeal or of
    the stay motion below.  </p>
