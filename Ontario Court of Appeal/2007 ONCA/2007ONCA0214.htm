    appeal concerns the interpretation of a disability insurance contract.  The
    appellant is an employee of the City of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto (the “City”).  The City has a contract with Manulife Financial (“Manulife”)
    to provide health and disability benefits to its employees including those
    who, in the course of their employment, are entitled to workers’ compensation
    for qualifying injuries.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant brought an action against the respondents after his claim for long-term
    disability (“LTD”) benefits was denied by Manulife.  That refusal was confirmed
    by the motions judge on Manulife’s motion to determine two questions of law
    before trial. The appellant appeals to this court.  I would allow the appeal
    in part.</p>

      motion proceeded on the basis of an agreed statement of facts.  The appellant
      is employed as a truck driver and loader by the City.  He is insured for
      LTD benefits under the group policy of insurance between the respondents.  On
      January 7, 1999 he was injured in a motor vehicle accident in the course
      of his employment, sustained serious injuries to his left leg, and suffered
      post-operative complications.</span></p>

      group policy was a self-insured plan funded by the City and administered
      by Manulife.  The policy provided that if an employee of the City became
      totally disabled, as defined in the benefit plan, and met all of the criteria
      set out in the benefit plan, then Manulife would pay monthly benefits on
      behalf of the City to the disabled employee.  The City retained ultimate
      authority to accept or decline the adjudication recommendations of Manulife.</span></p>

      the motor vehicle accident occurred in the course of his employment, the
      appellant was eligible to apply for and receive benefits under the <i>Workplace

      appellant made an application to the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board
      for benefits.  The WSIB advised him that he could elect to proceed with
      a civil action against the third party responsible for his injuries pursuant
      to ss. 30 (2), (4), and (5) of the<i> WSIA</i>.  The appellant elected
      to proceed with a civil action.</span></p>

    the commencement of the appellant’s action, Manulife brought a motion for
    the determination before trial of two questions of law, the essence of which
    were:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(1) Is the appellant
    entitled to receive LTD benefits under the policy after electing to proceed
    with a civil action?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    benefits subject to an offset of the amount of the Workplace Safety and Insurance
    Board benefits that he would have received had he not elected to proceed
    with a civil action?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motions judge decided that the appellant was not entitled to receive any
    LTD benefits and that the second question did not need to be answered.  The
    appellant appeals the judge’s disposition of the questions. </p>

lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I

      discussing and resolving the questions, it is important to first examine
      the relevant portions of Article 4 of the LTD plan.  The case turns on
      the interpretation of this Article which provides in part:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>The amount of Monthly Benefit payable to the Employee shall be <u>reduced
        by any payment to which the disabled Employee is entitled </u>for that

    to receive for dependent children;</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

      this Plan <u>must make application for any disability payments</u> for
      which he may be eligible under any Workers’
    Compensation Act or comparable legislative or insurance provision or under
    the Canada or Quebec Pension Plan, and any other benefits for which he may
    be eligible under (c) or (d) above, and until the amount of those payments
    has been established the Administrator reserves the right to make the reductions
    described above on the basis of the estimated amount of those payments.  Such
    estimated amounts must be mutually satisfactory to the City Treasurer of
    the Employer and the Administrator.  When the amount of such disability benefits
    has been established, the Administrator will adjust the reductions previously
    made to correct the amount.  [Underlining added.]</span></p>

      parties are agreed that in interpreting Article 4 ambiguities must be resolved
      in favour of the insured and not the insurer (the <i>contra proferentem </i>rule),
      coverage provisions should be construed broadly and exclusion clauses should
      be interpreted narrowly, and effect should be given to the reasonable expectations
      of the parties.  I do not find it necessary to resort to any of these principles
      as I find the ordinary meaning of the policy’s language to be clear and
      logical.</span></p>

      payments</u> for which he may be eligible under any Workers’ Compensation
      Act”.  [Underlining added.]  The first question is whether this condition

      appellant did make an application to the WSIB for benefits.  That application
      remains before the WSIB and is being processed according to the Act.  Section
      30 of the Act contemplates an application for WSIB benefits made by a worker
      who is also entitled to commence an action in respect of an injury or disease
      against a third party who is not the worker’s employer.  Although the appellant’s
      application is being processed by the WSIB in accordance with that section,
      he was deemed to have elected to commence an action rather than receive
      WSIB benefits.  </span></p>

      commence an action instead of claiming benefits under the insurance plan:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>1.         The worker or survivor is entitled to receive benefits
      under the insurance plan to the extent that, in a judgment in the action,

      3.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>2.         If the worker or survivor settles the action and the Board
      approves the settlement before it is made, the worker or survivor is entitled
      to receive benefits under the insurance plan to the extent that the amount
      of the settlement is less than the amount described in paragraph 3.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>3.         For the purposes of paragraphs 1 and 2, the amount is the
      cost to the Board of the benefits that would have been provided under the

      claim benefits under the plan instead of commencing the action.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
      the motions judge noted, in <i>Madill v. Chu</i>, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 400,
      the Supreme Court of Canada determined that the phrase “entitled to receive
      benefits” means that an insurer is entitled to reduce benefits on satisfactory
      proof that the insured could have successfully claimed the benefit whether
      or not such claim was actually made.  Ritchie J. held, at 409, that a worker’s “entitlement ‘<i>to
      receive</i>’ payments is not dependent upon a formal application for workmen’s
      compensation having been made and approved.”  [Emphasis in original.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

lang=EN-US>[20]<span

lang=EN-US>Madill v. Chu</span></i><span
lang=EN-US>, <i>supra</i>, as I understand it, stands for the proposition that
      the amount of reduction of payments under the plan for WSIB benefits which
      the appellant is “entitled to receive” is not the amount of WSIB benefits
      that the appellant <i>receives</i> but the amount of such benefits that
      the appellant <i>could have received</i> had he exercised his entitlement
      for them.  In this case, the amount by which the monthly benefit payable
      to the employee is reduced “by any payment to which the disabled Employee
      is entitled for that month” refers to the amount of WSIB benefits to which
      the appellant would have been entitled had he not elected to proceed with
      his civil action.  This interpretation gives effect to the observation
      of Ritchie J. in <i>Madill v. Chu</i>, at 410, that an insurer’s obligation
      under the policy should not be “varied adversely to its interest after
      the happening of the event insured against by the independent act of the
      insured”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      this interpretation, the subsequent language in the Article that allows
      the Administrator to estimate the amount of reductions, subject to adjustment
      when the amount of the WSIB benefits has been finally established, refers
      only to the administrative quantification of the appellant’s entitlement
      to WSIB benefits.  It does not refer to the application of ss. 30(14) and
      (15) of the Act which allow the WSIB to deduct from WSIB payments whatever
      amount of damages the appellant ultimately receives pursuant to a judgment
      or settlement of his tort action.  Thus, the result of the appellant’s
      tort action would not have the effect of reducing or eliminating the amount
      of the offset available to Manulife under the Article.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      would answer the second question in the affirmative by concluding that
      Manulife is entitled to reduce the monthly benefit payable to the appellant
      under the policy by the amount of WSIB benefits to which he would have
      been entitled had he not elected to proceed with an action.</span></p>

    find it unnecessary to consider whether the respondents have any rights of
    subrogation.  Further, whether and to what extent my conclusions in this
    case would result in double recovery for the appellant would depend on the
