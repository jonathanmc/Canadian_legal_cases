  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BY THE COURT:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal involves the interpretation of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990 c.H.8, s. 106(3), (since amended) which, at the relevant time, provided
    that “every person who drives on a highway a motor vehicle in which a seat
    belt assembly is provided for the driver shall wear the complete seat belt
    assembly in a properly adjusted and securely fastened manner.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    police officer observed the respondent in the driver’s seat of his car approaching
    a red light.  The officer illuminated the vehicle and confirmed that the
    driver was not wearing his seat belt.  The driver then pulled the seat belt
    across his body. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent was charged with failing to wear a seat belt contrary to s. 106(3).
    At trial, the respondent testified that when he got to the red light he put
    his car in park to check for his wallet, unfastening his seat belt in the
    process.  When he found his wallet, he refastened the seat belt and proceeded
    through the intersection.
     The respondent admitted that he had been operating the vehicle on the highway
    before he reached the red light and that the motor was still running while
    the car was in park.  He also admitted that his seat belt was unfastened
    for some fifteen to twenty seconds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Justice of the Peace who tried the case implicitly accepted the respondent’s
    evidence but concluded that his explanation did not constitute a defence
    to the charge.  He held that the purpose of the mandatory seat belt provision
    was road safety and that although the respondent had stopped at the light
    and put the vehicle in park, he was still operating and driving a motor vehicle
    on the highway.  He therefore convicted the respondent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, the provincial offences appeal judge held that once the vehicle was
    in park, the respondent was no longer driving on a highway.  The provincial
    offences appeal judge considered a dictionary definition of the word “drive” and
    found that the term implies movement of the car at the time of driving.  He
    concluded that while the respondent had care or control of the car, he was
    not driving the car.  He quashed the conviction and ordered a new trial</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Regional Municipality of York was granted leave to appeal to this court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the provincial offences appeal judge erred in his interpretation
    of s.&nbsp;106(3).  When interpreting the words “drives on a highway” in
    that section, it is important to take the broad purposive approach adopted
    by several recent decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada from Elmer A.
    Driedger, <i>Construction of Statutes</i>, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed. (Toronto: Butterworths,
    1983) at p. 87: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Today there
    is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be
    read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense
    harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention
    of Parliament.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Read
    in light of the important statutory purpose of minimizing driver and passenger
    injuries resulting from car collisions, the words “drives on a highway”,
    in our view, do not render the seat belt requirement inapplicable to the
    situation of drivers waiting at red traffic lights.  Such an interpretation
    would be inconsistent with the purpose of this statutory provision.  Accidents
    occur even when vehicles are stopped at traffic lights.  In our view, s.
    106(3) must be interpreted as requiring the driver to wear a seat belt continuously
    from the time he or she puts the vehicle in motion on the highway to the
    time the driver leaves the highway, parks the vehicle in a position in which
    the vehicle can be left unattended, or gets out of the vehicle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, we allow the appeal, set aside the order of the provincial
    offences appeal judge and restore the conviction and fine at trial.</p>
