  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals from the disposition made on June 16, 2006 following a
    hearing on April 12, 2006.  This hearing was held pursuant to s. 672.81(2)
    of the <i>Criminal Code </i>as a result of an increased restriction on the
    appellant’s liberty.  The Ontario Review Board found that the appellant continues
    to suffer from a serious mental disorder and that he remains dangerous.  The
    Board held that the present disposition of detention in the minimum secure
    unit of the Whitby Mental Health Centre (“WMHC”) was the least onerous and
    restrictive order.  The appellant submits that the Board erred in finding
    that he was dangerous and asks for an absolute discharge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    the April 12, 2006 hearing, the Board has held another hearing on August
    8, 2006 pursuant to s. 672.81(2.1) because of a request by the person in
    charge of the WMHC.  On November 2, 2006, the Board made a disposition ordering
    that the appellant be transferred to the medium secure unit of the WMHC.  The
    appellant has filed an appeal against that disposition.  Accordingly, the
    Crown and the person in charge argue that the appeal of the June 2006 disposition
    is moot.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    need not decide whether the appeal is moot because we have decided that the
    appeal fails on the merits.  The standard of review of a disposition by the
    Ontario Review Board is reasonableness:  <i>R. v. Owen</i>, [2003] 1 S.C.R.
    779.  We are satisfied that the disposition was reasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    record before the Ontario Review Board at the April hearing consisted of
    the hospital report, which gave a full picture of the appellant’s history,
    including his frequent involvement with the mental health system, the testimony
    of a psychiatrist, Dr. Hill, and the submissions by the parties, including
    the appellant.  While the appellant did not testify and did not call any
    other evidence, the Board gave him considerable latitude in making his submissions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    need not recite the history of this case; it is set out in the Board’s reasons
    for disposition.  The critical facts for understanding the issues in this
    appeal arise out of the Board’s previous disposition in June 2005.  At that
    time, although the Board upheld the detention of the appellant, it was critical
    of the slow progress in moving him into community living.  In August 2005,
    the appellant was discharged from the hospital and moved to a group home.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    December 2005, however, Dr. Hill recommended that the appellant be removed
    from the community facility and returned to the minimum secure ward of the
    WMHC.  Dr. Hill had met with the appellant in December.  The appellant was
    not happy at the group home, which he found noisy and chaotic.  Dr. Hill
    did not believe the appellant should be allowed to live on his own.  He was
    concerned that the appellant did not accurately report his feelings and behaviour
    and although he had obviously become isolated and withdrawn he did not understand
    this.  Admittedly, however, the appellant was reporting anxiety and distress
    from living at the group home.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s treating psychiatrist, Dr. Chapman, had also received a complaint
    that the appellant was in contact with a member of his family and had committed
    an act of vandalism against her property.  This was a concern because the
    index offences related, in part, to attacks on the appellant’s family members.  In
    fairness, this complaint of vandalism could not be verified.  However, more
    importantly, on two occasions, the appellant’s urine tested positive for
    cannabis.  Substance abuse increases the likelihood that the appellant will
    decompensate. In the result, Dr.&nbsp;Hill believed that the appellant needed
    to be returned to the hospital to clarify major concerns.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant denied that he had used cannabis and alleged that the hospital
    had tampered with the samples.  Before this court, the appellant conceded
    that this was not a wise position to take, but he continues to deny using
    cannabis and questions the reliability of the testing.  He pointed out to
    us, as he did to the Board, that he had no money available to purchase drugs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Board found as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>We are all satisfied
    that the accused continues to suffer from a serious mental disorder. All
    of the medical evidence is to this effect. The evidence of the index offence
    and the fear his wife and parents endured by reason of his conduct leads
    us to the conclusion that, untreated, the accused is dangerous. We reject
    his denial as to use of cannabis and his claim that the Hospital’s evidence
    is not credible.  Moreover, we find his use of that substance aggravates
    his state. We find the accused has little or no insight into his illness,
    the need for medication or the necessity to cease all use of substances.
    We think he must be detained and that the least onerous and restrictive order
    is that there be no change from the present Disposition, save to note that
    the experience of the last year underlines the caution required when determining
    when it is appropriate to exercise the privileges provided.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, this finding is supported by the evidence that was before the Board.  Dr.
    Hill’s opinion was rooted in the evidence.  The Board had the advantage of
    hearing that evidence, reviewing the entire record and hearing the appellant’s
    submissions.  It is evident that it did not rely on the alleged act of vandalism
    but rather on Dr. Hill’s assessment and the appellant’s continued illicit
    drug use, which was a serious concern given his history.  The Board was entitled
    to reject the appellant’s unsworn submissions denying that he used cannabis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is dismissed.  For the sake of clarity, obviously our holding
    on this appeal in no way fetters this court when it comes to deal with the
    appellant’s further appeal, which will be on the basis of a different record.  We
    urge the parties to arrange to have that appeal heard as soon as possible.</p>
