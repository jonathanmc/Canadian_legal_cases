    this appeal, JoAnne Walsh seeks a “stay” of a costs order made by Quigley
    J.; a “final order for child support for 2005 based on Michael Walsh’s 2004
    income of $515,252.00”; that this court’s decision in <i>Walsh v. Walsh</i> “be
    revisited”; and reinstatement of spousal support.  We will deal with each
    of the issues in turn.  For convenience, we will refer to the appellant as
    the mother and the respondent as the father.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Introduction</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal arises out of an application by the mother for an increase in spousal
    and child support and a cross-application by the father to terminate the
    spousal support.  The application judge dismissed the application and allowed
    the cross-application by stepping down the spousal support from $2,800 per
    month to $1,400 per month effective July 1, 2006, with spousal support to
    terminate on December 31, 2006.  In his order of October 11, 2006, the application
    judge awarded costs to the father on a substantial indemnity basis in the
    amount of $21,700.29 and included a term precluding the mother from bringing
    any further proceedings of any kind until that order was paid along with
    an earlier costs order made by Tulloch J.  That term provides as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>2.         The
    Respondent (JoAnne Constance Walsh) shall not be at liberty to bring any
    further proceedings of any kind in this ongoing litigation until Justice
    Tulloch’s cost order of $3,000.00 and this cost order of $21,700.29 in favour
    of the Applicant, Michael Walsh are satisfied in full.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal is part of on-going litigation between these former spouses since
    they separated in 1995.  The parties have two children now aged fourteen
    and thirteen.  While the parties have joint custody, the mother is the primary
    care-giver.  An important step in the history of the litigation between these
    parties includes the decision of this court in <i>Walsh v. Walsh</i> (2004),
    69 O.R. (3d) 577.  In that judgment, this court overturned an award of retroactive
    child support of almost $43,000 that was to have been paid by the father
    to the mother.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    other important piece of the history is a judgment of Tulloch J. in October&nbsp;2004,
    which he varied in January 2005, that fixed an amount of retroactive child
    support, fixed on-going child support, required the father to provide the
    mother with copies of his income tax return and notice of assessment on an
    annual basis and included a term barring further applications for retroactive
    child support.  That order was not appealed.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
      Costs Order</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a result of Rule 24 of the<i> Family Law Rules</i>, there is a presumption
    that a successful party is entitled to costs.  Under subrule (11), the judge
    in setting costs is to consider a number of factors including the unreasonableness
    of each party’s behaviour in the case.  In this case, the application judge
    concluded that because of the mother’s “egregious and unrelenting behaviour
    in the course of these proceedings” he should make an order for costs on
    the substantial indemnity scale.  Before reaching that conclusion, the application
    judge set out in a summary form the nature of the conduct that in his view
    required this unusual award.  We see no error in principle in his approach
    and would not interfere with the costs order.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are, however, concerned about para. 2 of the Order of October 11, 2006, insofar
    as it may impact on necessary on-going adjustments to child support.  As
    is well known, the payor parent’s child support obligation fluctuates depending
    upon the income of that parent.  Further, since the system is application
    based, unless the payor parent voluntarily adjusts the child support, the
    parties have come to an arrangement, or they have had one imposed by the
    court, further applications by the payee may be necessary to fix the amount
    of child support.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    as was observed by the court in <i>D.B.S. v. S.R.G.; L.J.W. v. T.A.R.A; Henry
    v. Henry; Hiemstra v. Hiemstra</i>, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 231 at para. 56, “the
    responsibility of ensuring that the proper amount of support is being paid,
    in practice, does not lie uniquely with the payor parent”.  Further, if the
    payor’s income rises “and the amount of child support paid does not, there
    will remain an unfulfilled obligation that could later merit enforcement
    by a court” [<i>D.B.S.</i>, at para. 59].  It must also not be forgotten
    that “support is the right of the child” [<i>D.B.S.</i>, at para. 60].  Therefore,
    just as the child should not suffer because of lack of vigilance by the payee
    parent in monitoring child support payments [<i>D.B.S.</i>, at para. 60],
    courts should also be careful to ensure that attempts to deal with alleged
    misconduct by the payee do not interfere with the rights of children to on-going
    child support in the amounts required by the Child Support Guidelines.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    until some other solution can be found to deal with on-going child support
    in this case, such as an automatic recalculation of child support based on
    the previous year’s income, we are of the view that the mother should not
    be barred from making further applications for the benefit of the children.  Paragraph
    2 of the October 11, 2006 order will therefore be varied as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>2.         The
    Respondent (JoAnne Constance Walsh) shall not be at liberty to bring any
    further proceedings of any kind in this ongoing litigation, except an application
    for variation of child support in accordance with the <i>Child Support Guidelines</i>,
    until Justice Tulloch’s cost order of $3,000.00 and this cost order of $21,700.29
    in favour of the Applicant, Michael Walsh are satisfied in full.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is allowed to that extent.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>2005
      Child Support</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    mother concedes that the father paid child support for 2005 in accordance
    with his 2004 income.  This part of the appeal is therefore moot.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Revisiting <i>Walsh
        v. Walsh</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    mother submits that we should revisit <i>Walsh v. Walsh</i> in light of the
    subsequent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>D.B.S.</i>, at para.
    60.  By “revisit”, the mother asks that we reverse the earlier decision and
    reinstate the order for retroactive support made back in 2003 by Snowie J.  Put
    simply, we have no power to do so.  The order of this court in <i>Walsh v.
    Walsh</i> is a final order and could only have been varied by a decision
    of the Supreme Court of Canada <i>in that case</i>.  The mother is also effectively
    barred from seeking this relief by the final order of Tulloch J. We therefore
    cannot give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Termination
      of Spousal Support</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge terminated spousal support primarily because of what he
    characterized as the “flagrant circumstances”
    where the mother has had ample time to obtain employment outside the home
    but has chosen not to do so.  Section 17(7) of the <i>Divorce Act</i> provides
    that an order varying a spousal support order, should consider among other
    factors “(d) in so far as practical, promote the economic self-sufficiency
    of each former spouse within a reasonable period of time”.  The authorities
    are clear that the judge is to take into account all of the relevant factors
    set out in s. 17(7).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was a basis in the record for the application judge’s conclusion both that
    there had been a material change in circumstances and that a time-limited
    spousal support order was appropriate.  Unless, it can be said that the judge
    gave unreasonable emphasis to the self-sufficiency factor, this court has
    no basis for interfering.  The application judge set out at length the history
    of the proceedings and the conduct of the mother that led him to find that
    the self-sufficiency factor was of particular importance in this case.  However,
    he also considered all the circumstances including the availability of child
    support; the mother’s allegation that her medical condition prevented her
    from obtaining employment (he drew an adverse inference against the mother
    because of the lack of medical evidence); that she had obtained employment
    in the recent past; and that the intention of the parties during the marriage
    was that the mother would stay at home until the children were in school.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are satisfied that the application judge did not make an unreasonable finding
    and did not place unreasonable emphasis on the self-sufficiency factor.  We
    would therefore not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is allowed only to the extent of varying paragraph 2 of the Order
    of the October 11, 2006 and is dismissed in all other respects.  Since the
    husband has achieved substantial success on the appeal, he is entitled to
    his costs of the appeal fixed in the amount of $3,500 inclusive of G.S.T.
    and disbursements.</p>
