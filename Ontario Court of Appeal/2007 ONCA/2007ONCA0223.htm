    by Justice Paul Rivard of the Superior Court of Justice dated January 18, 2006</span><span

  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite Mr. Koziebrocki’s able argument, we are not persuaded
    that the trial judge failed to give adequate reasons for accepting the evidence
    of the two complainants, despite the frailties in their testimony. The trial
    judge was fully familiar with their evidence. He was also alive to aspects of
    the complainants’ testimony that he disbelieved. He was, however, entitled to
    believe all, part or none of their evidence and on the critical point i.e.
    whether the appellant was present and participated in the home invasion, he was
    satisfied that the complainants were telling the truth.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s reasons made it clear that he was alive to
    the critical issue in the case. As he observed, at p. 231, “The defence
    submits, however, that the evidence of Brock and Chet Ritchie is not credible,
    not sufficiently reliable to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Mr. Keays
    was involved in the home invasion”. After setting out the critical issue, the
    trial judge addressed problems in the complainants’ evidence and he was
    satisfied, after listening to their testimony and observing their demeanour on
    the witness stand, that the difficulties with their evidence did not leave him
    in doubt about the appellant’s involvement and their evidence that was directed
    to that.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In that regard, the trial judge found that the evidence of the
    complainants was consistent and mutually corrobative.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In so concluding, we are satisfied that he considered and
    rejected the suggestion of collusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On that issue, in his reasons, the trial judge accepted Brock
    Ritchie’s evidence that he was persistent in seeking repayment of the monies
    owed by the appellant but he was not angry or threatening. This hardly supports
    the suggestion that he had a motive to falsely implicate the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He also noted that the police arrived shortly after the 911
    call and that Chet Ritchie provided the appellant’s name to the police in the
    absence of his brother Brock, who by this time had been taken to the
    hospital.  We note as well that prior to
    the arrival of the police, Brock testified that he was injured and almost
    passed out. Hence, he was unlikely to have engaged in collusion under the
    circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, while we agree that the trial judge could have
    been somewhat more fulsome in his reasons, we believe that the reasons, read in
    the context of the record, were adequate, both to enable the appellant to
    understand why he was convicted and to enable appellate review. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for sentence, the crimes committed by the appellant were
    very serious. The complaints were threatened at gunpoint and held hostage in
    their own home for over an hour. At the end of the event, just before the
    appellant and his accomplices left, the appellant poured alcohol over the
    complainants and threatened to set them on fire. This hardly suggests that he
    was an unwilling participant; rather, it speaks to him as the instigator.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also took into account that the home invasion
    here was “not a home invasion on a family or a little old lady or people who
    generally are law-abiding citizens” and he considered that in arriving at the
    sentence he did (six years less fourteen months for pre-trial custody and time
    spent under house arrest while on bail). In the circumstances, we are not
    persuaded that the sentence imposed was manifestly unfit; nor did the trial
    judge commit any errors in principle in his reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We recognize that the appellant has taken strides to
    rehabilitate himself and his progress is encouraging. We also acknowledge that
    he has good family support and this will bode well for his future. Those,
    however, are matters for the Parole Board and we are certain that they will be
    taken into account when the time arrives.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the appeal for conviction is dismissed. Leave
    to appeal sentence is granted but the appeal for sentence is dismissed.</p>
