  <p><b>On appeal from the order of Justice Hugh M. O'Connell of the Superior
      Court of Justice dated June 21, 2005.</b></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>WEILER J.A.:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal raises two issues concerning the effect of the appellant Brian Fraser’s
    bankruptcy on his family.  The first issue is whether the application judge
    erred with respect to the amount and date to which he ordered retroactive
    child support.  The second is whether the appellant’s discharge in bankruptcy
    released him from his obligation to pay the respondent, his former wife Heather
    Shea, an amount he had agreed to pay her in their separation agreement. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant married the respondent on October 20, 1990.  The couple had two
    children born December 5, 1991, and May 7, 1994. They separated on July 15,
    1996. Pursuant to an order dated September 22, 1997, the appellant was ordered
    to pay support for the respondent in the amount of $600 per month “as long
    as she is not working full time”, and child support in the amount of $448
    per month “based on an annual income attributed to the Defendant Husband
    of $30,000.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties entered into a separation agreement dated June 13, 1999.  The agreement
    provided for joint custody of the children, primary residence with the respondent,
    and child support “in accordance with the attached Judge’s endorsement dated
    September 22, 1997.”  In addition, under the heading “SETTLEMENT OF RIGHTS
    TO DIVISION OF NET FAMILY PROPERTIES”, the agreement provided:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The husband shall pay the sum of Three Hundred
    ($300.00) Dollars to the wife each and every month until such time as a total
    amount of Thirty Thousand ($30,000.00) Dollars has been paid to the wife
    in full satisfaction of this equalization payment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Around
    June 23, 2003, the appellant made an assignment in bankruptcy. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    September 11, 2003, the respondent’s solicitor wrote to the appellant asking
    that he pay the balance of the payment characterized in the separation agreement
    as an equalization payment, namely, $24,000 and requesting financial disclosure.  She
    requested the appellant’s income tax returns for the years 2001 and 2002,
    as well as his pay stubs for the year 2003. The appellant did not respond
    to this letter and he did not provide disclosure. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was discharged from bankruptcy on March 25, 2004. On January 6,
    2005, the respondent initiated proceedings to enforce payment of the $24,000
    and for increased child support. She asked that the order for increased child
    support be made retroactive to September 2003.  The appellant’s position
    was that he owed less than $24,000 and that, in any event, his bankruptcy
    had discharged the debt. He also resisted paying retroactive child support.
    Other issues that the parties raised in the proceedings, such as a dispute
    regarding access, payment by the appellant of his share of extraordinary
    expenses for the children, and interim ongoing child support were resolved
    by the parties consenting to an order made by Herold J. dated May 3, 2005.  This
    order states that the parties agree to vary paragraph 1 of the order of Dunn
    J. dated September 22, 1997 as follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Defendant is to pay the Plaintiff child support
    for the children…commencing May 1, 2005 in the amount of $897. per month
    based on an income of $67,000 per annum. </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>In addition, the appellant undertook
    to provide the respondent with copies of all of his T4 slips for the year
    2004 and a recent pay stub.  The issues forming the subject of this appeal
    were adjourned for hearing to June 21, 2005.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    June 21, 2005, the application judge granted the respondent’s application
    for increased child support retroactive to October 1, 2003.  He accepted
    the respondent’s calculation of retroactive child support based on the <i>Federal
    Child Support Guidelines</i>, <span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>S.O.R./1997-175</span> and ordered a retroactive payment totalling $7,951.
    In this regard his endorsement states:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Applicant satisfies criteria for retroactive support
    because notwithstanding demands for financial information none was forthcoming
    until now. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the request for summary judgment of the amount claimed by the
    respondent, the application judge resolved a dispute as to whether the amount
    yet to be paid  was $24,000 or $22,800, as well as whether the respondent
    was entitled to summary judgment, by endorsing the record as follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Equalization.  Balance owing $24,000.  The applicant
    was not named as a creditor.  Accordingly, there is no genuine issue for
    trial. Therefore, judgment to issue for $24,000. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals the quantum of retroactive support ordered.  In addition,
    he seeks to have the order granting the respondent summary judgement set
    aside and summary judgment granted in his favour containing a declaration
    that he does not owe anything.<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The order for retroactive child
      support</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her affidavit filed in support of increased child support, the respondent
    swore: 1) that she  had asked the appellant to provide her with copies of
    his tax returns for the years 2001, 2002, and a current and up to date pay
    stub for the year 2003 but that he had not done so; 2) that the appellant
    was employed at Toyota and that his income had substantially increased since
    the execution of the separation agreement; and 3) that in the circumstances
    she had no choice but to commence the proceeding. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s affidavit acknowledged that he had been asked to provide these
    documents, had not done so, and promised to do so.  He asked that support
    be re-examined back to January 1, 2001, arguing that his income then would
    have entitled him to pay a lesser amount of child support than that provided
    for under the agreement but that he had nevertheless largely made his support
    payments.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    judge at first instance did not accede to the appellant’s request and, as
    indicated, made an order for retroactive child support from October 2003
    to May 2005 when the order for ongoing support was made.  The total awarded
    for this period was $7,951.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this appeal, the appellant submitted that the judge at first instance ought
    to have made the order for support retroactive for a shorter period, namely,
    the initiation of proceedings in January 2005.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>D.B.S. v. S.R.G.; L.J.W.
    v. T.A.R.; Henry v. Henry; Hiemstra v. Hiemstra</i>, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 231
    is instructive.  Writing on behalf of himself, McLachlin C.J., LeBel and
    Deschamps JJ., Bastarache J. observed at paras. 48 and 54 that the obligation
    to pay child support is independent of a court order or any other kind of
    action by the recipient parent.  Parents have a free-standing obligation
    to support their children commensurate with their income.  Thus, parents
    who fail to pay appropriate support will have failed to fulfill their existing
    support obligations to their children. If the payor parent’s income rises
    and the amount of child support paid does not increase, the payor parent
    has an existing unfilled obligation that could later merit enforcement.  A
    court’s decision to enforce that obligation by making an order of support
    retroactively should not be regarded as exceptional.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, in deciding whether an order of retroactive support is appropriate,
    all relevant factors should be considered.  Where the parties have entered
    into a separation agreement but the payor parent’s circumstances have changed
    such that the payor parent is not paying the support obligation that actually
    exists, the court has a discretion to make a retroactive award of support
    so long as the applicable statutory regime permits it: see para 68. Blameworthy
    conduct by the payor parent, defined by Bastarache J. at para. 106 as “anything
    that privileges the payor parent’s own interests over his/her children’s
    right to an appropriate amount of support”, is one factor that will militate
    in favour of a retroactive award.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice
    Bastarache also indicated that while a court should consider the previous
    agreement or court order that the payor parent was following, and presume
    that compliance with that agreement or court order by the parent was reasonable
    on his or her part, the greater the disparity between what a payor parent
    acting reasonably should be presumed to pay and what is actually being paid,
    the more likely it is that this presumption will be rebutted.  Further considerations
    are the contribution the payor parent has made to extraordinary expenses
    for the children or other conduct that has had the effect of fulfilling his
    or her support obligation, the circumstances of the children, and any hardship
    occasioned by a retroactive award.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    shall now apply the considerations mentioned in <i>D.B.S., supra</i>, to
    the present appeal.  As indicated by his tax returns, the appellant’s disclosed
    income that increased from stated income of $11,788.48 for 2002 to $50,566.47
    for 2003.  His 2004 income tax return is not part of the record before us
    but it will be recalled that the order of May 2005 based support on income
    of $67,000 and, according to the respondent’s affidavit, the appellant has
    been steadily employed at
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toyota throughout.  Further, despite the fact that one of the appellant’s
    children had been diagnosed with an attention deficit hyperactive disorder
    and the respondent incurred extraordinary expenses for him and other extraordinary
    expenses for their other child, there is no evidence that the appellant paid
    his proportionate share of these expenses, as opposed to arbitrarily and
    sporadically paying some small amounts, until the court application was brought
    and the consent order of May&nbsp;3,&nbsp;2005 was made.  There is no suggestion
    that the children have in any event enjoyed all the advantages they would
    have received had the payor parent been appropriately supporting them.  Nor
    is there any evidence before us concerning hardship to the appellant. Retroactive
    support was appropriate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Insofar
    as the date to which retroactive support should be ordered, in <i>D.B.S.</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    Bastarache J.  held that the date of effective notice, as opposed to the
    date when an application was made to a court, formal notice, or the date
    when support should have increased, as a general rule should be the date
    to which the award should be retroactive.  He further held at para.&nbsp;123
    that in general “[I]t will usually be inappropriate to make a support award
    retroactive to a date more than three years before formal notice was given
    to the payor parent.”  At the same time, at para&nbsp;124, Bastarache J.
    acknowledged that the date from which increased support should have been
    paid will sometimes be a more appropriate date from which the retroactive
    order should start: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This situation can most notably arise where the
    payor parent engages in blameworthy conduct….This will not only be the case
    where the payor parent intimidates and lies to the recipient parent but also
    where (s)he withholds information.  Not disclosing a material change in circumstances--including
    an increase in income that one would expect to alter the amount of child
    support payable--is in itself blameworthy conduct.  The presence of such
    blameworthy conduct will move the presumptive date of retroactivity back
    to the time when circumstances changed materially.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the order for retroactive support goes back to October 1, 2003, a month after
    effective notice or the demand for disclosure was made.  This is a period
    of less than two years from when the application was brought and a date considerably
    after the appellant’s circumstances materially changed. Furthermore, in this
    case, the appellant engaged in blameworthy conduct.  He did not increase
    his payments as a result of the significant increase in his salary beginning
    in 2003 although he should reasonably have expected that increase to alter
    the amount of child support payable.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a> He neglected to provide information as to his
    financial circumstances for a significant time after it had been requested
    and after court proceedings had been initiated. In the result, this blameworthy
    conduct in which the appellant engaged is an additional reason for upholding
    the date to which the order of child support was made retroactive.  In arriving
    at this conclusion, I note that the obligation to pay appropriate support
    is an ongoing obligation. That obligation existed at the time of the appellant’s
    bankruptcy, was not discharged by his discharge in bankruptcy, and has no
    effect on third parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would uphold the order of the application judge that the appellant pay the
    respondent retroactive child support in the amount of $7,951. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The order for summary judgment  </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s position at the hearing and on appeal is that he declared bankruptcy
    on June 23, 2003, that he notified the respondent through her solicitor of
    his bankruptcy and the name of his trustee, that she proved no claim in the
    bankruptcy and that his discharge in bankruptcy has released him from paying
    the balance of the amount owing under the separation agreement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent’s position is quite different. The respondent states that through
    her solicitor she wrote to the appellant on September&nbsp;11,&nbsp;2003
    and asked the appellant to start making the outstanding payments owing.  She
    received no written response. Her affidavit material acknowledges that the
    appellant told her solicitor that he had made an assignment in bankruptcy.  The
    respondent’s affidavit goes on to say that, at the time, the appellant undertook
    to advise her solicitor of the name of his trustee in bankruptcy but did
    not do so.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am prepared to accept the application judge’s finding that the appellant
    failed to give the respondent the notice required under the <i>BIA</i>.  The
    appellant’s conduct prevented the respondent from seeking a declaration that
    the payment in issue would survive the bankruptcy or, alternatively, opposing
    his discharge in bankruptcy until she could negotiate an amendment to the
    separation agreement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge also held that, to the extent that notice had not been
    given, the appellant’s discharge was inoperative.  This was an error.  Although
    the respondent was not given the required notice, the appellant’s discharge
    in bankruptcy nevertheless releases him from all claims provable in bankruptcy
    unless the claim is one that is excepted under s. 178 or until the discharge
    is set aside or permission obtained to proceed with the claim<b>: </b><i>Janakowski
    v. Janakowski</i><b> </b>(2000), R.F.L. (5th) 117 at paras. 29-30 (S.C.J.). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant accordingly submits that we should allow the appeal and grant him

    in a separation agreement or a court makes an order for equalization under
    Ontario’s present <i>Family Law Act,</i> and the payor spouse subsequently
    makes an assignment or is petitioned into bankruptcy, an order of discharge
    will release the payor spouse from that liability: see The Honourable L.W.

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In which venue does this issue arise? Typically,
    the characterization issue is raised in matrimonial court as a shield to
    enforcement measures taken after the payor’s bankruptcy.  Unless the obligation
    is clearly for support, case law suggests that enforcement measures cannot
    be undertaken after bankruptcy without, first, either a judicial determination
    that it is a support obligation, or a judicial allocation or attribution
    as to what portion is referable to support. </p>

    found the appellant owed the respondent was a support obligation before ordering
    that summary judgment issue for its enforcement.  Perhaps he was of the opinion
    that the appellant’s conduct in the bankruptcy foreclosed the issue.  I will
    explain.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    what is stated to be Exhibit “A” to the appellant’s affidavit, sworn June&nbsp;15,&nbsp;2005,
    an unsigned handwritten document headed “Creditor Information” lists a debt
    owing to the respondent Heather Shea in the amount of $20,000, the approximate
    amount of the balance outstanding.  However, at Exhibit “G” to the appellant’s
    affidavit sworn February&nbsp;8,&nbsp;2005, there is a photocopy of a document
    headed “Liabilities” with the signature of Brian Gregory Fraser, the trustee
    in bankruptcy, at the bottom.  That document does not list the respondent
    as a creditor.  Instead, it lists the Ministry of Community and Social Services

    test for determining whether summary judgment should issue is whether there
    is a genuine issue for trial.  The appellant’s unexplained conduct in the
    bankruptcy proceedings raises a triable issue as to whether he acknowledged
    that the payment in issue is a substitute for support.  My conclusion that
    there is a triable issue as to whether the $24,000 is a debt or indemnity
    obligation in the nature of support that survives the appellant’s bankruptcy
    under s. 178(1) of the <i>BIA</i> is strengthened by consideration of a number
    of principles that Klotz has distilled in his book at 3-24. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN>First,
      would the claimant have been entitled to support had the debt not been
      granted?  If so, the obligation may be a substitute for support: see <i>Smith
      v. Smith (Trustee of)</i> (1989), 78 C.B.R. (N.S.) 256 (B.C.S.C.); <i>Van
      Norman v. Van Norman,</i> <i>supra</i>; and <i>Craig v. Craig</i>, <i>supra</i>).  </span>At
      the time that the separation agreement was entered into, there was an outstanding
      order for support in the amount of $600 per month in favour of the respondent
      until she obtained full time employment.  She was a mother with two young
      children in need of monthly support at twice the amount provided for as
      a monthly equalization payment in the separation agreement.  This was a
      six year marriage.  The length of time it would have taken the appellant
      to pay off the $30,000 at the rate of $300 per month is 8.33 years.  This
      length of time is not disproportionate to the length of time over which
      support might have been ordered. </p>

      does the debt reflect a specific valuation of an asset, or can it be traced
      in amount or nature to a property interest claimed in the proceeding?  If
      so, the quantum may reflect a property division rather than a support entitlement;
      or alternatively, it may be a pure or partial substitute for support.  See <i>Bremner

    agreement, no indication is given of the assets to which the payment relates,
    nor is there any schedule of the assets and their value attached to the agreement.  There

      agreement each released the other from
    “any and all rights past, present and future to maintenance” irrespective
    of the future economic circumstances of the parties.  When the husband declared
    bankruptcy, the wife applied for a declaration that the debt was not discharged
    by the bankruptcy.  There was no evidence that the wife had any other income.  The
    judge at first instance found that, as there was no provision in the agreement
    for the payment of any other maintenance, the purpose of the agreement was
    to provide the wife with a “terminal income” or to give her an opportunity

    is “provided in this agreement” is the payment of $30,000 by periodic payments
    of $300 a month.  Given the wife’s circumstances, namely, being a mother
    with two young children with a support order of $600 a month, it is hard
    to imagine how the wife could agree she was financially independent and not
    in need of support unless these terms were conditional upon payment of the
    periodic payments totalling $30,000 and she was looking to these payments
    in lieu of support.  Indeed, if the agreement is conditional upon the payments
    being made, the appellant’s bankruptcy will not release him from his obligation
    to make the payments whether they are characterized as support or an equalization
    payment. See <i>Millar v. Millar</i> (1991), 37 R.F.L. (3d) 113 (Alta.

    Sask. Q.B.) It is at least arguable that the releases are conditional upon
    the payment being made. Klotz indicates at 3-6 that the problem of determining
    whether the obligations in an agreement are conditional may be exacerbated
    by the thoughtless inclusion of boilerplate severability clauses. In this
    agreement, however, under the heading “SEVERABILITY OF TERMS”, one again
    finds the introductory phrase, “<i>Except as otherwise provided</i>,<i> </i>all
    of the terms of this agreement are severable from each other and will survive
    the invalidity of any other term of this agreement.” [Emphasis added.]  Again,
    if a functional approach to interpreting the agreement is adopted, it is
    at least arguable that the clause is subordinate to the “otherwise provided” periodic
    payments being made.  As well, it is arguable that the severability clause
    is only triggered by a finding that a term is invalid, which is not the situation
    here.    </p>

    wording of the separation agreement does not specifically link the periodic
    payments to support.  That said, having regard to the recitals to the agreement
    and its structure, an argument can be made that they are linked.  The concluding
    language of the recitals states</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>NOW THEREFORE THIS AGREEMENT WITNESSES <i>that

    state of the law.  In its recent review of the <i>BIA</i>, the Standing Senate
    Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce identified seven fundamental principles
    that it believed ought to guide the design of insolvency laws in this country:
    fairness, accessibility, predictability, responsibility, cooperation, efficiency,
    and effectiveness.<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[5]</span></span></span></a>  The situation before us reflects none of those
    principles.  At the very least, consideration ought to be given to amending
    the BIA to reflect the existing state of the common law, which is that any
    payment that fulfills the function of maintenance is maintenance.  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    matter of costs in family matters, is approached somewhat differently than
    in other civil litigation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Discretionary factors, including the
    ability to pay and the conduct of the parties prior to the litigation, can
    play a more significant role: <i>Drygala v. Pauli</i> (2003), 35 R.F.L. (5th)
    323 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region

    application judge made an order for costs in the amount of $2500 payable
    to the respondent.  I would set aside that order.  The respondent is entitled
    to her costs here and below with respect to the order for retroactive support.  I
    would fix the amount of those costs at $3500 all inclusive.  Insofar as the
    $24,000 payment is concerned, having regard to the fact that I would direct
    the trial of an issue, and all the circumstances of this appeal, I would
    order that the parties each bear their own costs.  </p>

    appears that s. 178(2) of the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, </i>R.S.C.
    1985, c.<i> </i>B-3 (the <i>BIA) </i>does not have the effect of releasing
    the debtor’s legal obligation to pay but rather prevents a creditor from
    pursuing remedies against the debtor’s property.  In <i>Re Handelman</i>,<i> </i>[1997]
    O.J. No. 3599 (S.C.J.) Farley J. upheld Master Ferron’s grant of leave to
    a creditor to proceed with an action against a discharged bankrupt.  In doing
    so, Farley J. considered the decision of Catzman J. (as he then was) in <i>Re
    Kryspin </i>(1983), 40 O.R. (2d) 424 (H.C.J.) respecting  the predecessor
    to s. 178(2) to the effect that the section does not extinguish the debt
    but only releases the debtor from claims provable in bankruptcy.  Justice&nbsp;Farley
    also noted that s. 69.3(1) of the <i>BIA</i> only stays any remedy against
    the bankrupt’s property and the commencement or continuation of any action
    for the recovery of a claim provable in bankruptcy.</p>

    appellant’s income tax return for the year 2001 shows his income as $3096.  In
    view of the fact that the earlier order of Dunn J. <i>attributed </i>income
    to the appellant of $30,000, it is not clear to me whether a court would
    have continued to impute this amount of income to him.   </p>

    the appellant submitted that the income disclosed in his 2001 tax return
    would have justified him paying a lower amount of support than that provided
    in the separation agreement.  Although not an issue on this appeal, I note
    that he was the person in possession of that information and he chose not
    to apply for a variation of child support.  Also, given that the earlier
    support order was based on <i>attributed </i>income, it is possible that
    a larger income, as opposed to the income disclosed in his tax return, would
    have been attributed to him.</p>

style='font-size:8.0pt'>The trustee is charged with fixing the amount the bankrupt
      must pay into the estate for distribution to creditors.  First the trustee
      determines the bankrupt’s total income from all revenues irrespective of
      their nature or source.  Next, the trustee determines the amount of a bankrupt’s
      earnings that are surplus earnings. Pursuant to s. 68(1), that is “the
      portion of the total income of an individual bankrupt that exceeds that
      which is necessary to enable the bankrupt to maintain a reasonable standard
      of living.”  In fixing the amount of surplus income to be paid into the
      estate for the benefit of creditors, the trustee is obligated to have regard
      to the bankrupt’s personal and family situation. In general, support payments
      are excluded from the determination of surplus income. As the trustee’s
      report in bankruptcy was not filed in these proceedings, I am unable to
      determine whether the appellant claimed any payments for his wife from
      his surplus income. Further, subject to the rights of secured creditors,
      s. 136(1) creates a priority for any lump sum amounts of support. As no
      such amount was owing to the FRO, I do not know whether the appellant received
      a benefit from claiming this priority.</span></p>
