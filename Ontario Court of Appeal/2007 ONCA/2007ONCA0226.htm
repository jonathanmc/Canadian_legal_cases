    appellants, <span style='font-family:&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>American Marketing Systems, Inc. and the Hume Group,
    Inc. </span>obtained an arbitration award in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Illinois against Old THGI, Inc. (Old THGI) and the respondents, Hume Publishing
    Company, Ltd. (Hume Publishing), Tudorcroft Investments, Inc. (Tudorcroft)
    and J. Trevor Eyton for $500,000, plus $244,406 in costs, both in U.S. dollars.  Two
    levels of court in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Illinois upheld the award.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants applied in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario to enforce the award against Old THGI and the respondents and to
    obtain judgment for the amount of the award.  The application judge enforced
    the award against Old THGI and dismissed the balance of the application.  The
    appellants appeal to this court.  In the event the appellants are successful
    in setting aside the dismissal, the respondents cross-appeal seeking a stay
    of the proceeding on the basis that the dispute should be referred to arbitration.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1998, the appellants, American Marketing Systems Inc. and what is now the
    Hume Group, Inc., both U.S. corporations, bought a business from Old THGI
    in accordance with an Asset Purchase Agreement (the Agreement), to which
    the respondents were “Parties”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Agreement provides for an adjustable purchase price that depended on the
    performance of the business during the first two years after its sale.  The
    appellants paid an initial $3,000,000 to Old THGI, which included a $500,000 “earnout” advance
    payment.  If the business performed well, the appellants agreed to pay more.  However,
    if the business performed poorly, the Parties agreed that the earnout advance
    would be returned to the appellants.  In the Agreement, the respondents,
    Hume Publishing and J. Trevor Eyton, agreed to indemnify the appellants in
    certain circumstances, in particular for the potential repayment of the “earnout” advance
    if it was not repaid by Old THGI.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Agreement provided for arbitration of disputes that arose under the Agreement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on his calculations of the EBITDA generated by the business under the terms
    of the Agreement, the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Illinois arbitrator held Old THGI liable for repayment of the earnout advance,
    plus the costs.  In addition, the arbitrator’s award named the respondents
    as parties liable for the award.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    completion of the review process in the Illinois appellate courts, the appellants
    brought an application in Ontario seeking two separate grounds of relief:
    first, to enforce the arbitration awards against Old THGI and the respondents;
    and second, for judgment against the respondents, framing the issue as one
    of interpretation of contract.  We address these two claims separately.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are of the view that it was open to the application judge to refuse to enforce
    the Illinois arbitration award on the basis of the <i>International Commercial
    Arbitration Act</i>, R. S.O. 1990, c. I.9.  Article 34(2)(a) of that Act
    provides that a court may set aside an arbitration award where the party
    making the application was not given proper notice of the arbitration or
    where the award deals with a dispute not falling within the terms of the
    submission to arbitration.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents did not receive proper notice of the arbitration, at least in
    their capacities as indemnifiers of Old THGI Inc.’s obligations. Moreover,
    neither the appellants’ counterclaim nor the arbitrator’s reasons raise or
    consider the parameters of the respondents’
    indemnification obligations under the Agreement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    those circumstances, the application judge was clearly entitled to decline
    to enforce the award against the respondents.  We see no basis to interfere
    with his decision on this issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants also sought judgment on the respondents’
    contractual indemnification obligations based on the provisions of the Agreement
    regarding indemnification of the appellants for certain of Old THGI’s liabilities.  The
    only two respondents against whom the appellants proceed in this appeal are
    Hume Publishing and J. Trevor Eyton, both of whom are based in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge’s reasons do not deal with this issue.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Agreement provides for arbitration of disputes between the parties, which
    would include, in the usual course, the respondents’
    obligations under the indemnity provisions.  It is the appellants’ position,
    however, given the arbitral awards from
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Illinois about the quantum of the advance and Old THGI’s liability to pay,
    there is no dispute left to arbitrate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the other hand, the respondents argue that they should be entitled to raise
    issues about their indemnification obligations, both regarding the Illinois
    requirement for good faith dealing and regarding the interpretation of “Buyer
    Indemnifiable Losses”, which is what they agreed to indemnify in the Agreement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Article
    8 of the <i>International Commercial Arbitrations Act</i> requires the court
    to refer a matter to arbitration where an action “is brought in a matter
    which is the subject of an arbitration agreement”.  In our view, the dispute
    between the parties in connection with the respondents’ indemnification obligations
    under the Agreement, at least arguably, is a matter which is the subject
    of the arbitration agreement.  See <i>Dalimpex Ltd. v. Janicki et al</i>,
    [2003] O.J. No. 2094 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  Since it is at least arguable that the issues sought to be determined
    by Hume Publishing and J. Trevor Eyton fall within the arbitration clause,
    this is a matter for the arbitral tribunal to decide at first instance.  In
    that circumstance, the judgment dismissing the indemnification claim is not
    appropriate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we would grant the appeal, but only on the second issue of the indemnification
    claim. We set aside the application judge’s dismissal of the application
    on that issue against Hume Publishing and J. Trevor Eyton, but stay that
    part of the application, and refer the appellants and these respondents to
    arbitration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    success on the appeal is divided, we make no order as to costs. In light
    of the result of this appeal, which leaves the application outstanding regarding
    the indemnification obligation, the costs below are reduced to $40,000, inclusive
    of Goods and Services Tax and disbursements. </p>
