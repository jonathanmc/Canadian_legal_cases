    two reasons for his finding of negligence.  Neither had been expressly pleaded.  Neither

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1995, Arthur Power had the upper lobe of his left lung removed because of
    lung cancer.  In January 1996, he started coughing blood.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was feared that Mr. Power’s original cancer had spread to his right lung
    or that a new cancer had begun in the right lung so he was referred to Dr.
    S. Ed Carroll.  Dr. Carroll is a specialist in both general and thoracic
    and cardiovascular surgery.  He had performed the surgery on Mr. Power’s
    left lung in 1995.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Power underwent a CT scan of his chest.  The CT scan showed a hilar mass
    and several shadows in the lower lobe of his right lung, justifying the concern
    that either a new cancer had developed in the right lung or that the cancer
    from the left lung had metastasized.  The scan also identified a new 1.3
    centimetre subcarinal lymph node that had developed since Mr. Power’s first
    surgery and was suspicious for cancer.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    subcarinal lymph nodes are located within the mediastinum.  The mediastinum
    is the middle portion of the chest cavity in which all thoracic organs, except
    the lungs, are found.  CT scans which identify new nodes in the mediastinum
    that are greater in size than one centimetre are predictive of cancer 85
    to 90% of the time.         </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    March 15, 1996, Dr. Carroll performed a mediastinoscopy on Arthur Power.  The
    object of the procedure was to obtain biopsies of lymph nodes in the mediastinum
    including, especially, a biopsy of the suspicious enlarged subcarinal lymph
    node.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    mediastinoscopy is an investigative medical procedure used to assess the
    stage of lung cancer.  During the procedure, a mediastinoscope – a tube with
    a bright fibre optic light inside it – is inserted through an incision made
    in the patient’s neck and down the space in front of the trachea (windpipe)
    into the mediastinum.  Biopsy forceps are used to take biopsies of lymph
    nodes observed through the scope.  Because the oesophagus is located almost
    directly behind the trachea, an unintentional biopsy of the oesophagus is
    a recognised risk of the procedure.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    the advent of the mediastinoscopy, a thoracotomy was the standard procedure
    used in the circumstances that Mr. Power faced.  It was much more dangerous
    because a thoracotomy involves opening the chest of the patient in order
    to locate and biopsy suspicious lesions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    process of a mediastinoscopy is staged.  The surgeon looks through the scope
    from the end outside the chest.  Biopsy forceps are inserted through the
    scope and biopsies are taken from the upper and lower lymph nodes on either
    side of the trachea.  If any appear abnormal, they are biopsied.  Biopsies
    are done by frozen section and sent to the laboratory.  The pathologist sends
    the results of the biopsy to the surgeon in the operating room within approximately
    seven to ten minutes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    any of these early biopsies tests positive for cancer, the procedure is terminated.  That
    is because once the cancer has spread to the mediastinum, it cannot normally
    be cured by surgery.  If, however, the nodes test negative for cancer, the
    scope is further advanced and additional biopsies are taken, particularly
    from enlarged new nodes.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the procedure, Dr. Carroll obtained biopsies of nodes in the left and right
    lower paratracheal areas and some in the subcarinal area.  None tested positive
    for cancer.  Given the negative results and, as he did not think that he
    had found the new enlarged subcarinal node that had been identified in the
    CT scan, Dr. Carroll advanced the mediastinoscope in order to locate and
    biopsy it.  He then took a 0.7 centimetre biopsy of what he believed to be
    the suspicious node (the
    “0.7 cm Biopsy”).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    0.7 cm Biopsy turned out to be a full thickness biopsy of the oesophagus.  Once
    this became apparent, Dr. Carroll immediately took corrective measures by
    performing a right thoracotomy to repair the oesophagus.<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  During the thoracotomy, Dr. Carroll further explored
    the lymph nodes, including the enlarged subcarinal node that he had been
    searching for, and concluded they were negative for cancer.  Consequently,
    he was able to proceed and remove the portion of Mr. Power’s right lower
    lung that contained the cancerous lesion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Carroll’s operative report was of significance to the trial decision.  The
    relevant portion of that report reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The dissection was carried down to the trachea.  We
    could not feel enlarged nodes in the superior mediastinum.  The scope was
    inserted.  We biopsied small nodes in the left lower paratracheal position.  We
    biopsied soft nodes in the subcarinal area and again some small soft nodes
    in the right lower paratracheal area.  On frozen section, none of these seemed
    to contain tumour.  The mediastinoscope was inserted further over the carina
    and encountered fleshy tissue which I felt might be the esophagus, or might
    be a soft node.  Biopsy was taken from this. Unfortunately, this is a full
    thickness biopsy of the esophagus so this man will require an immediate right
    thoracotomy to close the esophagus and to remove the lesion in the right
    lower lobe if feasible.  </p>

'>[16]<span

    Power and his family members sued Dr. Carroll, alleging that he had been
    negligent in his performance of the mediastinoscopy.  The family members’ claims
    were dismissed on consent of all parties; thus, the trial decision and this
    appeal are concerned only with Mr. Power’s claim.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three
    experts testified at trial:  Dr. Robert A. Zeldin for the Powers, and Drs.
    F. Griffith Pearson and Timothy L. Winton for Dr. Carroll.  The trial judge
    found all of the experts to be eminently qualified by virtue of their experience
    and education.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All
    of the expert witnesses testified that the mediastinoscopy was the appropriate
    procedure.  They also all agreed that an accurate diagnosis of Mr. Power’s
    condition was absolutely necessary if a proper treatment plan was to be created
    for him.  And, they all agreed that the enlarged subcarinal node had to be
    identified and biopsied in order to create such a plan.          </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his report prior to trial, Dr. Zeldin opined that Dr. Carroll had been negligent
    in two ways:  first, in advancing the mediastinoscope more than one centimetre
    below the carina; and, second, in taking the 0.7 cm Biopsy from a structure
    which he considered might have been the oesophagus.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, Dr. Zeldin opined that Dr. Carroll fell below the acceptable standard
    of care in performing the mediastinoscopy because he took the 0.7 cm Biopsy
    from a structure that he knew might have been the oesophagus.  He also opined
    that Dr. Carroll should have “backed out” on encountering what he thought
    might be the oesophagus but that if he were not prepared to do that, he could
    have taken a needle aspiration of the structure.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    defence experts, Drs. Pearson and Winton, testified that Dr. Carroll’s procedure
    did not fall below the standard of a reasonably competent thoracic surgeon
    at the time of the operation.  Both also testified that had they been in
    the circumstances that Dr. Carroll faced, they would have proceeded to take
    the biopsy.       </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Drs.
    Pearson and Winton both testified that a needle biopsy would not have been
    appropriate or useful because it could lead to a false negative finding if
    it did not sample enough cells. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They
    also both testified that it was appropriate for Dr. Carroll to take the 0.7
    cm Biopsy even though he was not certain the structure was a node.  In that
    regard, Dr. Pearson explained the difficulties of distinguishing, through
    the scope, the appearance of the anterior oesophageal wall from that of a
    lymph node.  He explained that a surgeon does not fall below the standard
    of care merely because he takes a biopsy of a structure while knowing that
    there is some risk that it could turn out to be the oesophagus.  Despite
    the risk of full perforation of the oesophagus, assumption of that risk is
    justified in order to obtain an accurate diagnosis.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    Dr. Winton testified that proceeding to take a biopsy while knowing that
    there is a small chance that the tissue being biopsied is the oesophagus
    would be prudent, provided the surgeon had made best efforts to distinguish
    between the lymph node and the oesophagus.  Like Dr. Pearson, he testified
    that it is difficult to differentiate among body structures, especially as
    the scope is inserted deeper into the subcarinal space.  The subcarinal space
    is very small, so the lymph nodes are very close to the oesophagus.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All
    three experts testified that they had unintentionally biopsied the oesophagus
    during a mediastinoscopy.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge held that the mediastinoscopy was
    “absolutely necessary” in order to obtain the most accurate diagnosis.  He
    did not view Dr. Zeldin as having opined that Dr. Carroll fell below the
    acceptable standard of care in performing the mediastinoscopy because he
    failed to perform a needle biopsy.  Nonetheless, he explicitly ruled that
    Dr. Carroll was not negligent in failing to perform a needle biopsy rather
    than continuing the mediastinoscopy.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge rejected the basis on which Dr. Zeldin relied, at trial, for
    his opinion that Dr. Carroll had been negligent, namely, continuation of
    the mediastinoscopy and taking a biopsy when it was possible that he might
    be taking the biopsy from the oesophagus.  He rejected that contention, finding
    at para. 46 of the reasons that continuation, even in the face of the acknowledged
    and known risk of a full thickness perforation of the oesophagus, “was acceptable
    and did not fall below the standard of a normal, prudent specialist in thoracic
    surgery”.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
    the trial judge found that Dr. Carroll was negligent when he took the 0.7
    cm Biopsy because he (1) failed to “attempt the due diligence of taking a
    smaller biopsy”, and, (2) “did nothing” in an attempt to differentiate between
    the nodes and the oesophagus before taking the 0.7 Biopsy.</p>

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE TRIAL JUDGE’S REASONS FOR
      FINDING NEGLIGENCE </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the trial judge’s negligence finding is central to this appeal, it is useful
    to consider the full text of the reasons in that regard.  They are contained
    in paras. 46 through 51 of the reasons, set out below:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[46] … 4)  Dr. Winton, the defence expert, indicated
    the importance of the diagnosis in order to formulate a treatment plan.  The
    diagnosis was so important that undertaking the risk of full thickness biopsy
    of the oesophagus was acceptable.  He qualified his evidence by saying that
    the doctor must perform his due diligence before proceeding.  The due diligence
    consisted of doing everything possible to identify and distinguish the oesophagus.  In
    addition, he testified that another way in which the due diligence could
    be achieved was to take a smaller biopsy than one might ordinarily take.  A
    third way was to “tease” out the tissues in this area by separating the fat
    from the lymph node and from the oesophagus.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In cross-examination Dr. Winton conceded that there
    was nothing in the operative report to indicate that Dr. Carroll made an
    effort to differentiate between the oesophagus and the soft node before he
    took the biopsy.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Dr. Winton further said that having done his due
    diligence and having decided to proceed, a <u>small</u> biopsy would be quite
    appropriate.  The seven-millimetre biopsy that Dr. Carroll took was, in the
    opinion of Dr. Winton, an appropriate size.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Dr. Winton testified after Dr. Carroll.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[47]     Dr. Carroll was not asked at any time
    about the size of the biopsy he took which turned out to be the oesophagus.  However,
    Dr. Carroll was asked by his counsel whether the largest specimen in the
    pathology report (.8 cm) was an unusual size.  He answered in the negative.  In
    my view, if the size of the specimens taken was not unusual, it indicates
    that Dr. Carroll did not, at any time, attempt the due diligence of taking
    a smaller biopsy.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[48]     Further, all experts including Dr. Carroll
    said that the deeper the scope is inserted, the closer it comes to the oesophagus.  Regardless
    of any difference (perceived or real) between Dr. Carroll’s evidence at trial
    and his operative report, I find that he did either nothing or insufficient
    due diligence to avoid the risk which he knew was there.  On that point at
    trial he testified:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Well I thought there was a small possibility
    that this might be the oesophagus but it was likely, not certain, but very
    likely that this was the subcarinal node that I really wished to biopsy.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[49]     He biopsied it notwithstanding that it
    was possible that it might have been the oesophagus.  In my view, he disregarded
    the known risk to achieve his goal – laudable as it was – to obtain the biopsy.  There
    was nothing in his evidence that indicated he addressed the risk once he
    appreciated that it was there.  He did nothing in an attempt to differentiate
    between the nodes and the oesophagus before proceeding.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[50]     His operative report also addresses this
    point:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>… The mediastinoscope was inserted further
    over the carina and encountered fleshy tissue which I felt might be the oesophagus,
    or might be a soft node.  Biopsy was taken from this.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[51]     As Dr. Winton conceded in cross-examination
    there is nothing in this part of the report to indicate that the required
    due diligence was undertaken.  [underlining in original]</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    a number of errors are alleged, in essence, this appeal raises a single issue:
    did the trial judge err in finding that Dr. Carroll fell below the standard

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    resolve that issue, I will examine both of the reasons given by the trial
    judge for his finding of negligence.  It will be recalled that the reasons
    were Dr. Carroll’s failure to: (1) “attempt the due diligence of taking a
    smaller biopsy”, and (2) do anything in an attempt to differentiate between
    the nodes and the oesophagus before he took the 0.7 cm Biopsy.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>Taking a smaller biopsy</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that Dr. Carroll was negligent because he took the
    0.7 cm Biopsy when he ought to have taken a
    “smaller” biopsy.  Three reasons lead to me to hold that this conclusion
    cannot stand.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Recall
    again para. 47 of the trial judge’s reasons.  It reads as follows:     </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Dr. Carroll was not asked at any time about the
    size of the biopsy he took which turned out to be the oesophagus.  However,
    Dr. Carroll was asked by his counsel whether the largest specimen in the
    pathology report (.8 cm) was an unusual size.  He answered in the negative.  In
    my view, if the size of the specimens taken was not unusual, it indicates
    that Dr. Carroll did not, at any time, attempt the due diligence of taking
    a smaller biopsy. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the trial judge’s conclusion is based on a manifestly incorrect finding of
    fact.  The largest specimen in the pathology report was not 0.8 centimetres,
    as the trial judge believed.  Immediately before taking the 0.7 cm Biopsy,
    Dr. Carroll had taken a biopsy specimen that consisted of multiple fragments,
    the largest of which measured 1.2 centimetres.  The difference between 0.8
    and 1.2 centimetres is significant, given that the question the trial judge
    was addressing was whether a 0.7 cm Biopsy was “small”.  Clearly, the trial
    judge was considering the size of the specimen taken in the impugned biopsy
    within the context of the largest specimen that had been taken during the
    procedure as a whole.  The larger specimen was 50% larger in size than the
    largest specimen that the trial judge understood had been taken.       </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    there was no evidence to support the trial judge’s finding that Dr. Carroll
    ought to have taken a smaller biopsy.  No witness testified that the biopsy
    taken by Dr. Carroll was not small.  In fact, the expert testimony is to
    the contrary.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    cross-examination, Dr. Pearson testified that the 0.7 cm Biopsy was “a small
    biopsy”:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        …. It would not have been an acceptable
    course of action to biopsy that oesophagus?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        And I didn’t know that was your question.
    And I would find it, a situation in which trying to put myself in it, <b>I’d
    probably take a small biopsy of what I assumed to be the anterior oesophageal
    wall</b>, not anticipating that there was a risk of full thickness perforation.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        <b>You would have taken a smaller biopsy
      than Dr. Carroll did</b>, if you thought it was a fifty-fifty?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        <b>I did not say that. I said I’d have
      taken a small biopsy. He did take a small biopsy. Its seven millimetres
      in size.      </b> [emphasis added]  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Winton testified that the biopsy was “reasonable”, in the circumstances: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        All right. Now, I want you to further
    assume that upon taking a biopsy, that <b>the surgeon takes what he describes
    as a very small biopsy, and it is a seven millimeter biopsy</b> that is ultimately
    taken, and it is at that point that he realizes that it may be the oesophagus. <b>Is
    that a reasonable sized biopsy to take in the circumstances where you’re
    not absolutely certain?</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        <b>Yes.</b>     [emphasis added] </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Zeldin did not testify on the matter.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And,
    as the trial judge noted in para. 47 of the reasons, Dr. Carroll was never
    asked, at any time, about the size of the 0.7 cm Biopsy, a matter on which
    more is said later. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the trial judge’s conclusion is based on an inference that was not available
    on the evidence.  The trial judge stated that if the size of the specimens
    taken was not unusual, it meant that Dr. Carroll had not taken a small biopsy.  The
    fact that specimens are not unusual in size does not necessarily mean they
    are not small.  The size of a surgical biopsy is a highly technical and relative
    matter.  It may be that all specimens taken in such a location are small.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this regard, I do not accept the respondents’
    argument that it was open to the trial judge to infer that the 0.7 cm Biopsy
    was not small given that the average size of a lymph node is 0.4 to 0.6 cm
    and that a 0.8 cm biopsy is, according to the appellant, not unusual.  If
    a 0.8 cm biopsy is not unusual, it may very well be that a 0.7 cm biopsy
    is small.  We simply do not know and there was no expert evidence to support
    the inference that a 0.7 cm biopsy is not small.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    finding that Dr. Carroll took no steps to distinguish the oesophagus from
    the node before he took the 0.7 cm Biopsy, the trial judge relied on Dr.
    Winton’s evidence.  In particular, he relied on Dr. Winton’s “concession” that
    there is nothing in Dr. Carroll’s operative report to indicate that the required
    due diligence was undertaken.  </p>

'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Winton unequivocally stated that Dr. Carroll met the standard of care required
    of a surgeon in the circumstances.  He repeatedly testified that Dr. Carroll
    took appropriate steps to distinguish the structures.  He also repeatedly
    testified that Dr. Carroll had done the dissection necessary to discriminate
    between the node and the oesophagus.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.&nbsp;Winton
    began by identifying the standard of care to which a surgeon in Dr. Carroll’s
    situation should be held.  He was then asked to comment on a hypothetical
    fact scenario in which a surgeon is conducting a mediastinoscopy on a patient
    whose CT scan shows a 1.3cm node in the subcarinal area.  The surgeon has
    biopsied nodes that were negative for cancer, but he does not believe that
    he has reached the 1.3cm node. The surgeon then advances the scope, and believes
    he has found the node but recognizes there is some risk that it may be the
    oesophagus.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Winton testified that the surgeon should “ma[k]e the best effort they could” to
    delineate between the node and the oesophagus, but he emphasized that it
    would be “quite appropriate” for the surgeon to take a biopsy after performing
    his “due diligence” in distinguishing between the structures.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Winton maintained that it would be appropriate to take a biopsy of a structure
    believed to be the 1.3cm node if the surgeon believed the risk of biopsying
    the oesophagus was “very small”, “less than one in ten”, or smaller than
    the “chances of missing an important part of the procedure [i.e., the biopsy]”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Winton later provided greater detail on how the surgeon might perform due
    diligence in distinguishing the oesophagus from the node.  He stated that
    surgeons typically use “landmarks” to locate the relative positions of the
    carina and the nodes.  Further, he explained that various other techniques
    may be used:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>We also use … dissection with … the instruments
    that we have available to us, to try and tease out the tissues in this area,
    separate out the fat from the lymph node, from the oesophagus. </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>It is clear from Dr. Winton’s testimony
    that he considers these techniques to be standard components of the mediastinoscopy.  Attempting
    to differentiate between the two structures is a standard component of the
    procedure, even though it is not always successful.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    cross-examination, Dr. Winton was asked repeatedly whether Dr. Carroll’s
    operative note reveals that he took appropriate steps to distinguish Mr.
    Power’s oesophagus from his lymph nodes.  Dr. Winton maintained throughout
    his testimony that Dr. Carroll’s notes show that he was proceeding in accordance

    Winton explained Dr. Carroll’s operative note as follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        You’ve had occasion to review Dr. Carroll’s
    operative report for the March 15<sup>th</sup> procedure in question?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        And from your review of that report,
    is there anywhere on the report that indicates that Dr. Carroll did his utmost
    best to identify the important landmarks in question?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Uh – <b>my review of that – uh – dictation
      in my report suggested that I felt he had – he had – uh – proceeded in
      a standard fashion.</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Now, in that [operative] report, there’s
    no indication in the language Dr. Carroll used that he took any means to
    identify the different landmarks in the area in question, specifically, as
    between the oesophagus or the lymph node. Is that not right?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        <b>Well, he used language that – uh – I
      would use to describe the procedure. I don’t – uh – he’s – he’s identified
      that he’s in the subcarinal area, and that he is dissecting – uh - the
      area, and – uh –
    because of – uh – the nature of the findings, he’s – he’s where he should
    be. He’s in the subcarinal space, where he knows the node’s abnormal, and
    he’s encountering – what’s it say here?</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>He says: “Encountered fleshy tissue”.  So, he’s
    identified the carina. “The mediastinoscope was inserted further over the
    carina.” So, he has identified the relevant structure in the area, the carina,
    the split between the trachea and the two main airways is a – an important
    landmark. So – uh – it would indicate to me that he’s identified the carina. <b>He
    knows he’s in the subcarinal space, and – uh – he has advanced the scope
    and he’s identifying fleshy tissue. And he knows that the oesophagus might
    be there and he knows that the lymph nodes should be there, because of the
    CT scan. So, I see no indication here that he hasn’t done the relevant dissection.  </b> </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…<i> </i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        However, in Mr. Carroll’s case – I’m
    sorry, Dr. Carroll’s case, if we read his operative report and in fact, the
    sentence that you just read a few moments ago, which is about the seventh
    line up from the bottom. “A mediastinoscope was inserted further over the
    carina, and encountered fleshy tissue, which I thought,” I’m sorry, “which
    I felt might be the oesophagus or might be a soft node. Biopsy was taken
    from this.” On a reading of this report, it would appear, would you agree
    with me that it would appear Dr. Carroll knew that he was taking a piece
    of the oesophagus?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        No. He’s stating here, quite clearly,
    that he was dissecting in the appropriate area, and he came across fleshy
    tissue which was different than the black node that he saw earlier – uh – and
    one would be looking for the lymph node. It –
    it’s abnormal on the CT scan. It’s a new, reactive lymph node that might
    be reactive from inflammation, from infection or cancer. And it could be
    a lymph node, just as easily as it could be the oesophagus.  <b>So, he’s – he’s
    saying that he’s dissecting appropriately, and he’s identifying structures
    and he – he knows he has – uh – an abnormality that he needs to try to – uh – differentiate
    between cancer and non-cancer, given the implications to the patient’s management
    and prognosis.</b>  So, I – I don’t see anything here that says that he knew
    he was biopsying the oesophagus.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…<i> </i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Now, Dr. Winton, it was your opinion
    that Dr. Carroll utilized standard techniques in the mediastinoscopy procedure,
    isn’t that right?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Yes.<i> </i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>…</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        And is there any indication in Dr. Carroll’s
    report that he used every indication possible to do his best to differentiate
    between the lymph node and the oesophagus?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        I’ve always – <b>I already answered that
      question for you.  I – I don’t see anything in his report that suggests
      otherwise.</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        … If I could refer again to Dr. Carroll’s
    report, at page 35. Could you please point out to us where in the report
    Dr. Carroll states that he tried to differentiate between the node and the
    oesophagus?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        He specifically is dissecting in the
    area of interest. He has a CT scan wherein he knows there’s a new abnormality
    in the subcarinal space, which, as you have pointed out is – uh – in – in
    an area that’s close to the oesophagus. We’re there, whenever we do this
    procedure. He’s dissected it out. He’s concerned about – uh – the possibility,
    and he has a lymph node that – which needs to biopsied. He doesn’t quantify,
    but he gives a reasonable indication that he felt this was – uh – possibly
    the lymph node in question, and it was needing to be biopsied, so he went
    ahead and biopsied it.”  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        And would you agree, Dr. Winton that
    your opinion that you offered this court today differs from Dr. Zeldin’s
    opinion in this case?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        I –
    I had seen Dr. Zeldin’s written opinion. I don’t know what Dr. Zeldin testified. <b>But,
    I see nothing in this report that suggests that – uh – that the procedure

    that Dr. Carroll failed to make the necessary efforts at differentiation.  It
    was a palpable and overriding error on the part of the trial judge to find

    in the same terms that Dr. Winton would, himself, use.  <span>  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the record is incapable of supporting the trial judge’s finding that Dr.
    Carroll failed to take the necessary steps to differentiate between the oesophagus
    and the node before taking the 0.7 cm Biopsy.  There is no evidence in the
    record to support such a finding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    previously explained, Dr. Winton unequivocally opined that Dr. Carroll had
    done the necessary dissection and taken the appropriate steps to distinguish
    between the structures.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Pearson did not testify as extensively as Dr. Winton on the question of whether
    Dr. Carroll exercised appropriate care in distinguishing Mr. Power’s nodes
    from his oesophagus, before taking the 0.7 cm Biopsy.  He did, however, testify
    that Dr. Carroll’s operative note revealed that he was proceeding appropriately.  Specifically,
    the respondent’s counsel asked Dr. Pearson to comment on the excerpt of the
    note that reads:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The mediastinoscope was inserted further over the
    carina and encountered fleshy tissue which I felt might be the esophagus,
    or might be a soft node. Biopsy was taken from this.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Pearson agreed that this passage indicates that Dr. Carroll biopsied tissue
    that he believed might be the oesophagus or might be the node.  He acknowledged
    that the words themselves do not indicate that Dr. Carroll believed one possibility
    was more likely than the other, but testified that no conclusions could be
    drawn from the choice of wording:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        …
    And you would agree with me that there’s nothing in that report per se, which
    indicate[s] that the author thought the possibility of the tissue in question
    being the oesophagus was only a slight possibility?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        No, but I – uh – would assume that anyone
    as experienced as Dr. Carroll with mediastinoscopy would know that the – uh – the
    odds were indeed less than ten percent, or considerably less than ten percent
    that it was oesophagus. I would assume that. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Pearson further indicated that it is not common practice to put percentages
    in operative notes, and therefore no significance should be attached to Dr.
    Carroll’s failure to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary, Dr. Pearson’s testimony supports the view that Dr. Carroll performed
    the surgery in accordance with accepted standards in all regards, including
    making appropriate efforts to differentiate nodes from oesophagus when taking
    the 0.7 cm Biopsy.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Zeldin gave no evidence on these matters.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was no evidence before the trial judge to suggest that Dr. Carroll should
    have done something further during the dissection process to differentiate
    between the oesophagus and the node.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent’s argument on this issue is essentially that, in the absence of
    specific language in the operative note detailing the steps Dr. Carroll took
    to determine whether the questionable structure was the oesophagus or a node,
    it was open to the trial judge to infer that none were taken.  I do not agree
    that this inference was available on the record.  None of the experts testified
    that the absence of this detail in the operative note suggests that no steps
    were taken to distinguish the structures.  In fact, as outlined in detail
    above, Dr. Winton made the opposite assertion: he testified that Dr. Carroll’s
    note indicates that he <i>did</i> take appropriate steps to distinguish the
    structures.  Similarly, Dr. Pearson testified that it could be assumed that
    Dr. Carroll had taken the appropriate steps.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    although Dr. Carroll and the experts agreed that the purpose of an operative
    note is to record important events, it is apparent that such notes routinely
    omit details of the standard steps common to all similar procedures.  Without
    expert evidence that the absence of greater detail in the operative note
    indicates that Dr. Carroll did not take appropriate steps to distinguish
    the structures and in the face of expert evidence that the note and procedures
    met the appropriate standard of care, it was unreasonable for the trial judge
    to draw such an inference. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    no inference of negligence was available, this meets the respondents’ contention
    that the burden had shifted to the appellant to disprove negligence.  Unlike <i>Hassen
    v. Anvari</i>, [2003] O.J. No. 3543 (C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused,
    30044 (April 29, 2004), the onus on the respondents, as plaintiffs, had not
    been discharged by circumstantial evidence.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    allegations of negligence against Dr. Carroll, by the respondents’ expert,
    were either abandoned or rejected by the trial judge.  Dr. Carroll’s experts
    unequivocally opined that he met the standard of care.  For the reasons already
    given, there was no evidence on which Dr. Carroll could have been found to
    have fallen below the requisite standard of care.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    raises the question of whether it was an error of law for the trial judge
    to craft his own allegations of negligence.  As I have explained, neither
    of the two reasons given by the trial judge for a finding of negligence,
    can stand.  Strictly speaking, therefore, I need not answer this question.  Nonetheless,
    procedural fairness considerations prompt me to make the following observation.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    two reasons given by the trial judge for finding negligence were not expressly
    pleaded nor had they been commented on by the plaintiffs’ expert.  The result
    is that the factual matters underlying those allegations were never squarely
    addressed either with Dr. Carroll or his expert witnesses.  In my view, in
    those circumstances, it was unfair to then decide those issues against Dr.
    Carroll.  Fairness dictates that a defendant should have notice of the particular
    allegations against him and an opportunity to meaningfully respond to those
    allegations. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would allow the appeal, set aside the trial judgment and dismiss the action
    with costs of the appeal to the appellant, if sought, fixed at $25,000, inclusive
    of GST and disbursements. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the appellant wishes to pursue costs of the trial, brief written submissions
    on the same are to be filed with the Court within fourteen days of the date
    of release of these reasons.  The respondents have a further seven days within
    which to file responding submissions. </p>
