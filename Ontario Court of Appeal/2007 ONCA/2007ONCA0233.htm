    indicated at the appeal hearing that this appeal would be dismissed. These
    are our reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants are a group of employees who were previously employed by Bombardier
    Inc. (“Bombardier”) within its Information Technology Services (“ITS”) Group. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    July 11, 2003, Bombardier entered into a contract with Conseillers en Gestion
    et Informatique CGI Inc. (“CGI”) to transfer the Bombardier ITS Group to
    CGI. Under the terms of the contract, Bombardier transferred significant
    assets to CGI, including computer servers, a mainframe, as well as desktop
    and laptop computers while CGI agreed to assume the functions and responsibilities
    performed by the ITS Group and to offer full-time employment to 194 of the
    members of the ITS Group, including all of the appellants. Significantly,
    CGI also agreed to recognize each of the affected employee’s original date
    of hire with Bombardier both for the purpose of determining notice of termination
    and severance pay under the applicable employment standards legislation and
    for common law purposes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    July 10, 2003, the appellants were given approximately eight weeks’ notice
    that their employment with Bombardier would terminate on September 7, 2003.
    They were also advised that they would receive an employment offer from CGI
    in mid-August to perform substantially the same work on equivalent terms
    and conditions as their existing employment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    August 11, 2003, the Bombardier/CGI transition team made a presentation to
    the appellants to advise them of their proposed new terms and conditions
    of employment and of how the transfer from Bombardier to CGI would affect
    them. During the presentation the appellants were advised that there would
    be a flow-through of their years of service from Bombardier to CGI and that
    CGI would recognize their Bombardier seniority. On August 13, 2003, the appellants
    received written offers of employment from CGI. All of the appellants accepted
    these offers and commenced working for CGI on September 8, 2003.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants commenced this action against Bombardier on March 5, 2004, in
    which they claim severance pay pursuant to the <i>Employment Standards Act,
    2000</i>,<i> </i>S.O. 2000, c. 41 (the “ESA”). The parties agreed that summary
    judgment under rule 20.04(2)(b) was the appropriate mechanism for determining
    the issue. Accordingly, on March 22, 2005, the respondent brought a motion
    for summary judgment to dismiss the appellants’
    claim, while the appellants brought a cross-motion for summary judgment for
    payment of their severance pay. On April 7, 2005, Spiegel J. granted the
    respondent’s motion, dismissed the appellants’ action, and also dismissed
    the appellants’ cross-motion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is common ground that but for the provisions of s. 9 of the ESA, the appellants
    would be entitled to severance pay from Bombardier. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    9 of the ESA provides that “[i]f an employer sells a business or a part of
    a business and the purchaser employs an employee of the seller, the employment
    of the employee shall be deemed not to have been terminated or severed for
    the purposes of the Act”. The section also provides that in such circumstances,
    the employee’s “employment with the seller shall be deemed to have been employment
    with the purchaser for the purpose of any subsequent calculation of the employee’s
    length or period of employment.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    central issue on this appeal is whether the motion judge erred in failing
    to apply the “going concern” test for determining whether the Bombardier/CGI
    transaction constituted a sale of a part of a business within the meaning
    of s. 9 of the ESA. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are two further provisions of the ESA that are especially relevant to this
    issue. Section 9(3) of the ESA states that “‘sells’
    includes leases, transfers or disposes of in any other manner, and ‘sale’ has
    a corresponding meaning.” Section 1 of the ESA provides that “‘business’ includes
    an activity, trade or undertaking; (‘enterprise’).”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his reasons, the motion judge determined that the transaction between Bombardier
    and CGI constituted a sale of a part of a business for the purposes of s.
    9 of the ESA. He noted that it involved the transfer of a “specific bundle
    of tasks and functions performed by an identifiable group of employees” and
    significant assets to CGI. The motion judge also found that the affected
    employees were re-employed by CGI and continued to apply “essentially the
    same skills and functions and in many cases used the same facilities and
    equipment” as they had while at Bombardier. Further, in response to an argument
    by the appellants, the motion judge held that if an employee accepts employment
    with a purchaser employer it is irrelevant for the purposes of s. 9(1) of
    the ESA that the terms of the employee’s employment are radically or fundamentally
    different from those that existed with the vendor employer. In any event,
    the motion judge concluded that the appellants had failed to meet their onus
    of demonstrating that the terms of their employment with CGI were radically
    or fundamentally different than the terms of their employment with Bombardier. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    submitting that the motion judge should have used the “going concern” test
    in determining whether the Bombardier/CGI transaction amounted to the sale
    of a part of a business within the meaning of the ESA, the appellants rely
    significantly on the decision of Adjudicator Randall in <i>Re Campbell</i>,
    [1993] O.E.S.D. No. 115, dealing with the interpretation of s. 13 of the<i> Employment
    Standards Act</i>, R.S.O. 1980 c. 137 (the “1980 Act”). Section 13 of the
    1980 Act is the predecessor provision to s. 9 of the ESA. It reads, in part,
    as follows: “Where an employer sells a business to a purchaser who employs
    an employee of the employer, the employment of the employee shall not be
    terminated by the sale, and the period of employment of the employee with
    the employer shall be deemed to have been employment with the purchaser for
    the purposes of Parts VII, VIII, XI and XIV”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Campbell</i>,
    Adjudicator Randall adopted the test set out in <i>Kenmir Ltd. v. Frizzell</i> (1967),
    1 ALL E.R. 414 (Q.B.), for the purpose of determining whether a particular
    transaction amounts to the sale of a business. The <i>Kenmir</i> test focuses
    on “whether the effect of the transaction was to put the transferee in possession
    of a going concern, the activities of which could carry on without interruption.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, the appellants rely on <i>Federated Buildings Maintenance Corp.</i>, [1989]
    O.E.S.A.D. No. 14, a decision of Referee Franks interpreting s. 13 of the
    1980 Act. Referee Franks relied on <i>Metropolitan Parking Inc. v. C.U.P.E.</i>,
    [1979] O.L.R.B. Rep. 1193, in which the Ontario Labour Relations Board (the
    “OLRB”) was required to determine whether there had been a sale of a business
    within the meaning of the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario <i>Labour Relations Act</i> (the “OLRA”). In <i>Metropolitan Parking</i>,
    the OLRB referred to <i>Kenmir</i> and also made a distinction between subcontracting
    out work and the transfer of a business. Further, the Board stated, in part,
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>For a transaction to be
    considered a “sale of a business” there must be more than the performance
    of a like function, by another business entity. There must be a transfer
    from the predecessor from the essential elements of the business as a block
    or as a “going concern”. A business is not synonymous with its customers
    for the work it performs or its employees. Rather, it is an economic organization
    which is used to attract customers or perform the work. The legislature could
    have provided for the continuation of bargaining rights whenever there is
    a continuity of the work performed but it did not do so. Bargaining rights
    are continued only when the employer transfers <i>his</i> business.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying
    on these authorities, the appellants submit that Bombardier made an agreement
    with CGI that amounted to nothing more than a contract to outsource its information
    technology services department in order to reduce expenses. By virtue of
    that agreement, employees and assets forming part of the ITS Group were transferred
    to CGI and Bombardier obtained information technology services from CGI at
    a lower cost. The appellants argue that an employer hiving off a portion
    of its labour requirements in order to save money does not constitute a sale
    of part of a business for the purposes of the ESA. They maintain that the
    Bombardier/CGI transaction amounted to the transfer of an administrative
    function to CGI, not of a going concern. By itself, information technology
    services did not contribute to the profitability of Bombardier, but rather
    was an expense. The appellants contend that the agreement in this case was
    in pith and substance a transfer of assets with an option to hire Bombardier’s
    employees. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants concede that the statutory definition of
    “business” under the <i>ESA </i>is not specifically limited to going concerns.
    However, they submit that the purpose of the broad definition in this statute
    goes to jurisdiction and is designed to capture workplaces that are not driven
    by a profit motive. Where the employer is a commercial entity, the appellants
    say that a definition of “business” that focuses on the concept of a “going
    concern” is appropriate.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not accept the appellants’ submission for two reasons. First, we note
    that the ESA is remedial legislation intended to set minimum standards for
    terms of employment. As such, in accordance with the provisions of s. 10
    of the <i>Interpretation Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.11, it should be given “a
    fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as will best ensure
    the attainment of the object of the Act according to its true intent, meaning
    and spirit.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Viewed
    in the context of the entire statute, in our view, the purpose of s. 9 of
    the ESA is to protect minimum statutory entitlements that are related to
    length of employment where the purchaser of a business, or part of a business,
    continues to employ the employees of the vendor following the sale. Such
    entitlements include: vacation entitlements, entitlements to pregnancy and
    parental leaves, as well as entitlement to notice of termination or pay in
    lieu of notice and severance pay. In our view, this statutory purpose is
    apparent from the expansive definitions of business and sale that are included
    in the ESA, the nature of the protections the ESA provides, and the wording
    of s. 9 of the ESA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants contend that the rights we have referred to are hollow rights
    in the context of a case such as this one where the appellants’ seniority
    rights both for statutory and common law purposes were guaranteed by contract.
    However, we note that in <i>Machtinger v. HOJ Industries Ltd.</i>, [1992]
    1 S.C.R. 986, the Supreme Court of Canada held that an interpretation of
    the predecessor act that extended protection to as many employees as possible
    is to be favoured over an interpretation that does not.  In our view, the “going
    concern” test could only serve to narrow the ambit of s. 9 of the ESA. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    while the “going concern” test has been used by the Ontario Labour Relations
    Board in decisions dealing with the meaning of sale of a business under the
    OLRA, we are not persuaded that that means that it is appropriate that the
    same test should be used under the ESA. We note that
    “business” is not defined in the OLRA, whereas it is broadly defined in the
    ESA. More importantly, the two legislative regimes target different issues.
    As noted in <i>Metropolitan Parking</i>, the OLRA regime is aimed, at least
    in part, at providing for the continuity of relationships between unions
    and employers in the context of the sale of a business. By way of contrast,
    the purpose of the ESA regime is to protect individual rights and to preserve
    continuity of seniority. Viewed in this context, in our view, the meaning
    of business in s. 9 of the ESA is to be given an expansive interpretation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his reasons, the motion judge relied on the decision of Referee Brown in <i>Re
    Merrill Lynch
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    Inc.</i>, August 7, 1987, E.S.C. 2256. In <i>Merrill Lynch</i>, the issue
    was whether the actions of a financial services company in outsourcing its
    keypunch operations constituted the sale of a business for the purpose of
    s. 13 of the 1980 Act. In addition to noting the differing purposes of the <i>Labour
    Relations Act</i> and employment standards legislation, Referee Brown referred
    to the fact that “business” was a broadly defined term under the 1980 Act,
    and said, “the services of secretaries, clerks and, in this case, keypunch
    operators, clearly fall within the definition of an ‘activity’ and ‘undertaking’ within
    the meaning of s. 13 [now s. 9]”. Referee Brown also noted that “[w]hile
    the transfer of this activity or undertaking may not have included some normal
    indicia of a ‘going concern’…there was the transfer of a specific bundle
    of tasks and functions performed by an identifiable group of employees.” In
    addition, he said:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Section 13 is not a limitation
    placed upon the application of the Employment Standards Act. Quite the contrary,
    its purpose, as previously indicated, is to ensure that the accumulated period
    of employment of an employee, which entitles him or her to certain benefits
    under various parts of the Act, will be carried over from one employer to
    another where a sale has taken place. If the section is applicable, several
    benefits are immediately available to an employee; this would not be the
    case if the section is inoperable, …At the same time, there are no disadvantages
    to an employee solely from the operation of that section. If the new employer
    decides to terminate him, he is entitled to a period of notice consistent
    with the accumulated services of employment with both the old and new employer.
    If he later decides to resign his employment, he is in no worse position
    than he would have been if the sale had not taken place.</p>

'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the motion judge made no error in relying on <i>Merrill Lynch</i>.
    Moreover, we see no error in his findings and conclusions on this issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to the main issue on appeal, the appellants also claimed that the
    motion judge erred in failing to find that the appellants’ employment with
    CGI was fundamentally or radically different than their employment with Bombardier,
    and therefore that the provisions of s. 9 of the ESA do not apply. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not accept this submission. The appellants’ main complaint is that while
    they were entitled to a defined benefit pension at Bombardier, they receive
    no similar benefit at CGI. There was also some other evidence identifying
    other alleged differences in the appellants’ employment at CGI, such as a
    requirement to contribute some portion of the cost of other benefits. In
    addressing this issue, the motion judge noted that Bombardier filed evidence
    indicating that it had retained the services of a consulting agency specializing
    in employee benefits to determine the present value of the loss of pension
    benefits for each employee and that that amount was translated into an upward
    salary adjustment for each employee. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assuming,
    without deciding, that s. 9 of the ESA does not apply in the event of a fundamental
    or radical difference in employment with a successor employer, we are not
    persuaded that the motion judge erred in his conclusion on this issue. As
    noted by the motion judge, there were no cross-examinations on the affidavits
    that were filed. Viewed in context, in our view, the evidence adduced by
    the appellants did not rise to the level of demonstrating a <i>fundamental</i> or <i>radical</i> difference
    in their employment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellants raised an issue on appeal concerning the effect of Bombardier
    failing to provide them with notice of the fact that, if they accepted employment
    with CGI, it (Bombardier) was relying on s. 9 of the ESA; however, if the
    appellants chose not to accept employment with CGI, it (Bombardier) would
    be responsible for their severance pay. As the appellants did not raise this
    as an issue in their statement of claim, we concluded it was unnecessary
    that we address this issue on appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent
    fixed at $10,000 inclusive of disbursements and applicable G.S.T.</p>
