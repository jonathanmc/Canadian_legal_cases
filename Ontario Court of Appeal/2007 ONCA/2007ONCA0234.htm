    for unlawfully extracting funds from the pension plan it established for

    Act, 1992</i>, S.O. 1992, c. 6 (the “Act”) prevent the action from being
    brought as a class action because the remaining claim of restitution to the
    plan can be brought as a representative proceeding under Rule 10 of the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i>?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    the reasons that follow, I agree with the motion judge that the claim for
    direct distribution must be struck. However, I disagree that the result is

    I would allow the appeal.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt;'>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    appellants are three former employees of the respondent Bank who are currently
    receiving pensions under the Bank of Canada Pension Plan (the “Plan”). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Plan was established in 1936 as a defined benefit plan to provide pensions
    to bank employees on their retirement. It is registered with the federal
    pension regulator, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions.
    The Bank is the Plan’s sponsor and administrator. CIBC Mellon Trust Company
    is the custodial trustee of the assets of the Plan. The Plan is ongoing and
    currently has such a substantial actuarial surplus that the Bank is prohibited
    by the <i>Income Tax Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5<sup>th</sup> Supp.), from
    making contributions to the Plan without violating a condition of its registration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants’ proposed class action describes the proposed class generally
    as those persons who, between January 1, 1993 and the date of certification
    of the action, were beneficiaries under the Plan. Their statement of claim
    asserts that after January 1, 1993 the Bank improperly caused funds to be
    paid out of the Plan to cover costs of administration. This is said to be
    both a breach of trust and a breach of contract. The appellants do not allege
    that any members of the proposed class have been denied the payments to which
    they are entitled under the Plan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
    relief is claimed against the custodial trustee. But, as against the Bank,
    the appellants seek declaratory relief and an accounting of the improperly
    extracted funds. In addition, they seek the relief that underlies the issues
    in this appeal: first, an order that the extracted funds be equitably allocated
    and distributed to the class members; and second, in the alternative, that
    the Bank make restitution to the Plan in respect of the extracted funds.
    They also seek damages for breach of trust and breach of contract.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Bank moved under Rule 21 to strike out the claim that the extracted funds
    be equitably allocated and distributed to class members. In this appeal,
    all parties referred to this as the claim for direct payments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion also sought a declaration that the appellants’ action cannot be brought
    under the Act because of s. 37(a), which provides that the Act does not apply
    to a proceeding that may be brought in a representative capacity under another
    act. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion was conducted on the basis of the appellants’
    pleadings only. No evidence was led, and for the purpose of the motion, the
    factual allegations pleaded are taken as established. On this basis, the
    respondent Bank accepts that the breach alleged is established.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge granted both orders sought by the Bank. She held that the claim
    for direct payments is not available as a matter of law because all beneficiaries
    have received all the payments to which they are entitled under the Plan,
    and because the appropriate trust law remedy is the return of the extracted
    funds to the Plan. She then went on to find that the remaining claims for
    declaratory relief and restitution to the Plan could be brought by way of
    representative action under the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>. As a consequence,
    she concluded that s. 37(a) of the Act precludes this action from being brought
    as a class proceeding.</p>

    appellants argue that the court has a wide discretion in fashioning equitable
    remedies and that the claim for direct payments is one available remedy for
    the respondent’s breach of trust, whether it is called equitable allocation
    or damages. They say that at this stage of the proceedings it is not plain
    and obvious that this claim will fail.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consideration
    of this argument must begin with the breach of trust for which the claim
    for direct payments is said to be a viable remedy. That breach (conceded
    for the purpose of the appeal) is that the respondent wrongfully extracted
    funds from the Plan to pay the costs of administering the Plan. There is
    no suggestion that the respondent has retained a benefit by doing this, so
    there is nothing to be disgorged. Nor is there any suggestion that any beneficiaries
    of the Plan have received less than the full payments to which they are entitled
    under the Plan. Consequently, the only loss consists of the funds extracted
    from the Plan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    these circumstances, the remedial approach taken by trust law was described
    in the concurring judgment of Wilson J. in <i>Guerin v. Canada</i>,<i> </i> [1984]
    2 S.C.R. 335 at 360:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The position
    at common law concerning damages for breach of trust and, in particular,
    the difference between the principles in trust law from those applicable
    in tort and contract, are well summarized in the following passages from
    Mr. Justice Street’s judgment in the Australian case of <i>Re Dawson; Union
    Fidelity Trustee Co. v. Perpetual Trustee Co.</i> (1966), 84 W.N. (Pt. 1)
    (N.S.W.) 399, at pp. 404-06:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>The obligation
    of a defaulting trustee is essentially one of effecting a restitution to
    the estate. The obligation is of a personal character and its extent is not
    to be limited by common law principles governing remoteness of damage.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>Caffrey
      v. Darby</i> (1801) 6 Ves. Jun. 488; 31 E.R. 1159 is consistent with the
      proposition that if a breach has been committed then the trustee is liable
      to place the trust estate in the same position as it would have been in
      if no breach had been committed. Considerations of causation, foreseeability
      and remoteness do not readily enter into the matter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    reflects the fundamental objective of the remedy provided by equity for a
    breach of trust, as enunciated by La Forest J. in <i>Canson Enterprises Ltd.
    v. Boughton &amp;
    Co.</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 534 at 577:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Equity aimed
    at restoring a person to whom a duty was owed to the position in which he
    or she would have been had the duty not been breached. This it did through
    a variety of remedies, including compensation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the same case, in a concurring judgment, McLachlin J., as she then was, outlined
    the use made of compensation as an equitable remedy, given a defaulting trustee.
    In circumstances where the trustee has wrongfully removed trust property
    that cannot be restored to the trust, the trust receives compensation in
    its place. She put it this way at p. 547:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>What is the
    ambit of compensation as an equitable remedy?  Proceeding in trust, we start
    from the traditional obligation of a defaulting trustee, which is to effect
    restitution to the estate. But restitution <i>in specie</i> may not always
    be possible. So equity awards compensation in place of restitution <i>in
    specie</i>, by analogy for breach of fiduciary duty with the ideal of restoring
    to the estate that which was lost through the breach. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the application of these remedial principles is straightforward.
    The breach of trust is the wrongful extraction of funds from the Plan by
    the respondent to pay administration costs. Restitution of the funds to the
    Plan can be done, and if done, would restore the Plan and the beneficiaries
    to the positions they would have been in had the breach of trust not taken
    place.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    the beneficiaries have all received full payment of all that is owed to them
    under the Plan, there is no basis upon which compensation could be ordered
    to be paid to them in addition to restitution to the Plan itself. Nor is
    that sought by the appellants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
    is claimed is that the wrongfully extracted funds be equitably allocated
    and distributed among class members, rather than returned to the Plan. The
    appellants seek to preserve this as a remedy available to be sought at trial.
    They argue that equitable remedies are in the discretion of the court and
    that the court must have the flexibility to grant the relief that is just
    in the circumstances. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Canson</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    La Forest J. made clear that the court’s discretion to adapt equitable remedies
    to the circumstances of a particular case has as its objective the needs
    of fairness and justice. He said this at pp. 585-86 and 588:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I agree … that
    the maxims of equity can be flexibly adapted to serve the ends of justice
    as perceived in our days. They are not rules that must be rigorously applied
    but malleable principles intended to serve the ends of fairness and justice. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Its flexible
    remedies such as constructive trusts, account, tracing and compensation must
    continue to be moulded to meet the requirements of fairness and justice in
    specific situations. Nor should this process be confined to pre-existing
    situations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    sustain their claim for direct payments at trial, the appellants would have
    to demonstrate that this remedy, rather than the remedy of restitution to
    the Plan that the law of trusts has always provided, is what meets the requirements
    of fairness and justice in this situation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the case as pleaded makes it plain and obvious that this claim cannot
    succeed for several reasons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the claim for direct payments would give the class members more than they
    are entitled to receive from the Plan. Since the Plan is ongoing, their entitlement
    as beneficiaries is to receive the defined benefits provided in the Plan.
    They can claim no more. See <i>Schmidt v. Air Products Canada Ltd.</i>, [1994]
    2 S.C.R. 611 at 654. These entitlements have been fully satisfied. The claim
    for direct payments is inconsistent with both the principle in <i>Schmidt</i> and
    the objective of equity, namely to restore those to whom the duty was owed
    to the position they would have been in had the duty not been breached. To
    this extent, the primary remedy sought by the appellants does not meet the
    requirements of fairness and justice but rather is contrary to them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the claim for direct payments prefers the interests of existing beneficiaries
    of the Plan and disregards the interests of contingent beneficiaries, namely
    those who become members of the Plan after the date of certification and,
    as a result, fall outside the class. Instead of the wrongfully extracted
    funds being returned to the Plan for the benefit of all present and future
    beneficiaries, the claim for direct payments prefers the interests of the
    former and disregards the interests of the latter. This, too, makes the claim
    for direct payments contrary to the requirements of fairness and justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    I disagree with the appellants’ argument that only the remedy of direct payments
    can serve fairness and justice. They say this is so because the remedy of
    restitution to the Plan risks violating the prohibition on further contributions
    to the Plan by the Bank, and such a violation would be detrimental to all
    beneficiaries. The appellants argue that, for this reason, the restitutionary
    remedy cannot meet the requirements of fairness and justice, leaving the
    claim for direct payments as the only viable option. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    simple answer to this argument is that the tax legislation does not prohibit
    restoration of money improperly paid out of the Plan. If the respondent were
    to make restitution to the Plan, the amount repaid is not considered a contribution
    by the respondent within the meaning of the <i>Income Tax Act</i>. Advance
    rulings by the Canada Revenue Agency support this conclusion. See particularly <i>Damage
    payments to registered pension plan</i> (1999), Canada Revenue Agency Ruling
    9903533, and <i>Damages paid to RPP and RRSP </i>(23 January 2004), Canada
    Revenue Agency Interpretation 2003-005193117. Thus, it cannot be said that
    for this reason the restitutionary remedy would be to the detriment of beneficiaries.
    The claim for direct payments does not therefore stand as the only viable
    option.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellants rely on the decision in <i>Sutherland v. Hudson’s Bay Co.</i> (2005),
    74 O.R. (3d) 608 (S.C.J.). In that case, Cullity J. certified a pension class
    proceeding alleging a breach of trust by the employer arising from improper
    payments out of the pension fund. One of the common issues certified was
    the question of remedy, including payment directly to class members or restitution
    to the trust fund.</p>

line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I read <i>Sutherland</i>, it does not decide that the claim for direct payments
    is a viable remedy. It simply puts over to the trial the choice between this
    and the restitutionary remedy. In that case, the defendant did not move to
    strike the claim for direct payments under Rule 21, but rather consented
    to the certification of this common issue. Thus, I do not think that <i>Sutherland </i>is
    of any assistance to the appellants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    summary, the remedy that the law has always provided for the breach of trust
    alleged here, namely restitution to the Plan by the respondent, is available.
    On the other hand, the claim for direct payments does not serve the requirements
    of fairness and justice in these circumstances. Thus, I think it is plain
    and obvious that that claim will not be granted at trial as the remedy for
    breach of trust.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the claim for direct payments is equally unavailable as a remedy
    for the breach of contract claim. Since the class members have received all
    the payments owed to them and it is not pleaded that they have suffered any
    other losses, the claim for direct payments is unsustainable as an award
    of damages to class members for breach of contract. </p>

line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I

    out and that this ground of appeal must fail. </p>

      appellants argue that the motion judge erred in concluding that after the
      claim for direct payments was struck out, the relief pleaded could be sought
      in a representative proceeding pursuant to Rule 10, and that s. 37(a) of
      the Act therefore precludes it from being sought in a class action. The
      respondent takes the opposite view, although it concedes that if the action
      includes the claim for direct payments it can be brought as a class action.
      The respondent relies primarily on rules 10.01(a) and (b) and, alternatively,
      on s. 33.2(1) of the <i>Pension Benefits Standards Act, (1985)</i> R.S.
      1985, c. 30 (the “<i>PBSA</i>”), which permits the Superintendent of Financial
      Institutions to bring an action against a plan administrator that a member
      of the plan could bring. It is helpful to set out these various provisions.</span></p>

      I find support in the precise language used by the legislature in s. 37(a).
      While it is true that with the assistance of the <i>Interpretation Act</i>,
      R.S.O. 1990. c. I.11 the language used in the English and French versions
      could probably be extended to include “regulation” we were pointed to no
      regulation under which a representative proceeding can be brought other
      than <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>. Had the legislature intended to extend
      the prohibition in s. 37(a) to proceedings that may be brought  “… under
      another Act <u>or the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i></u>”, that language
      could easily have been employed.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Moreover,
      I think the legislative intent behind the Act is contrary to the respondent’s
      position. It is beyond controversy that one of the primary objectives was
      to facilitate access to justice. An aspect of that was to reduce the legal
      and economic obstacles for actions that would otherwise have to be brought
      as representative proceedings under the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>.
      This theme is seen clearly in the thinking that led up to the Act, for
      example in Ontario, Ministry of the Attorney General, <i>The Report of
      the Attorney General’s Advisory Committee on Class Action Reform</i>, vol.
      1 (Toronto: Policy Development Division, 1990) at 18-19.</span></p>

      that the Act was designed in part to make it procedurally easier to bring
      actions that would otherwise have to be brought as representative proceedings
      under the rules, it would be anomalous to interpret s. 37(a) as automatically
      removing that remedial benefit for actions that could be brought as representative
      proceedings under Rule 10. Such an interpretation would make it impossible
      to do what the Act was designed to achieve.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Rather,
      in my view, the correct interpretation of s. 37(a) is that it precludes
      resort to the Act only where another piece of legislation provides expressly
      for representative proceedings. That is, in enacting s. 37(a) the legislature
      decided that only where it had elsewhere provided specific legislation
      authorizing representative proceedings in a particular context would that
      prevail over its legislation of general application, namely the Act. Examples
      of such specific legislation are the <i>Co-operative Corporations Act</i>,
      R.S.O. 1990, c. C. 35, s. 68(1), and the <i>Credit Unions and Caisses Populaires
      Act</i>, <i>1994</i>, S.O. 1994, c. 11, s. 50(1).</span></p>

      interpretation of s. 37(a) is consistent with the seminal research paper
      on class actions, Ontario Law Reform Commission, <i>Report on Class Actions</i> (Toronto:
      Ministry of the Attorney General, 1982). At p. 846 of vol. 3 of that report,
      the Ontario Law Reform Commission reiterated that its primary concern was
      to provide a reformed procedure for actions that would otherwise be brought
      as representative proceedings pursuant to the <i>Rules of Practice</i> (as
      they were then called). The Commission was careful to say, by contrast,
      that its recommended class action legislation should not apply to any representative
      action authorized by any other Act.</span></p>

      respondent’s position that s. 37(a) extends to any representative proceeding
      that may be brought under the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> has another
      difficulty. Those rules, though enacted by regulation, are made by the
      Civil Rules Committee, an appointed body under the <i>Courts of Justice
      Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C. 43. The respondent’s proposed interpretation
      requires the conclusion that the legislature has delegated to the Civil
      Rules Committee the effective power to determine through its rule-making
      the limits on the range of operation of this carefully constructed piece
      of remedial legislation. In my opinion, it is most unlikely that the legislature
      would have done this without expressly saying so. </span></p>

      respondent’s proposed interpretation also does not sit easily with its
      concession that the appellants’ claim for direct payments could be brought
      under the Act. I can see nothing in Rule 10 that would prevent the appellants’
    action from being brought as a representative proceeding if it included the
    claim for direct payments. If that is so then, contrary to the respondent’s
    concession, s. 37(a) of the Act would preclude the action from being brought
    as a class action even if it included the claim for direct payments.</span></p>

      the respondent offers a policy reason in support of its interpretation
      of s. 37(a). It points to a number of procedural provisions of the Act
      that it says serve no purpose once the claim for direct payments is struck
      out. In response, the appellants point to other provisions of the Act that
      they say avoid procedural difficulties with a representative proceeding,
      whether or not the claim for direct payments remains.</span></p>

      seems to me that this debate is exactly contemplated by the Act, in the
      requirement that at the certification stage, the preferred procedure must

      relevant at that point, not at the threshold of determining whether s.
