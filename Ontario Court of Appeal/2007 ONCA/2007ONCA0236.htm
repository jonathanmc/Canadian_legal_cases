  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:
normal;'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was convicted by Hurley J. of sexual assault and sexual touching.
    At the time of the relevant events, the appellant was the common-law partner
    of the complainant’s mother. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:
normal;'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    main issue on appeal is whether the trial judge erred in admitting out-of-court
    statements made by the five-year-old complainant to her foster mother for
    the truth of their content based on the principled exception to the hearsay
    rule. The appellant contends that the out-of-court statements were neither
    reasonably necessary nor reliable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:
normal;'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dealing
    first with necessity, the appellant submits that since the complainant testified
    at trial, provided what appears to be a full and frank account of alleged
    physical abuse by the appellant, and confirmed that she had recounted all
    the things the appellant did to her (which did not include any elements of
    sexual abuse), the trial judge erred in holding that admitting the out-of-court
    statements was reasonably necessary. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:
normal;'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree. The trial judge made an express finding that the complainant “was
    not at all inclined to describe the incidents she described to [her foster
    mother]” while testifying in court. Given the complainant’s evidence that
    she could not remember all the things she told her foster mother and that
    she told her foster mother the truth, it was open to the trial judge to make
    this finding. Moreover, the trial judge had the distinct advantage of being
    able to see the manner in which this very young complainant testified. In
    all the circumstances, we are not persuaded that there is any basis to interfere
    with his conclusion that admission of the out-of-court statements was reasonably
    necessary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:
normal;'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning
    to reliability, the appellant submits that the circumstances under which
    the out-of-court statements were made did not offer a sufficient guarantee
    of trustworthiness to justify their admission. He points to evidence that
    the complainant’s foster mother asked her questions about the appellant;
    that there was an ongoing custody dispute between the complainant’s mother,
    her grandmother and her biological father at the time of the complainant’s
    disclosures; that the complainant’s first disclosure may have come shortly
    after a visit with her father and that the complainant’s mother had complained
    to authorities about possible sexual abuse by her biological father. The
    appellant also relies on various alleged frailties in the foster mother’s
    testimony.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:
normal;'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not accept these submissions. The trial judge made specific findings rejecting
    the arguments that were made to him concerning the presence of suspicious
    circumstances relating to the complainant’s disclosures and concerning alleged
    weaknesses in the foster mother’s testimony. Further, he relied on four factors
    as providing a sufficient circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness to
    justify the admission of the out-of-court statements: i) five year-olds do
    not generally have any knowledge of the type of sexual conduct that the complainant
    attributed to the appellant; ii) similarly, five year-olds do not generally
    have the capacity to fabricate the explicit descriptions of sexual conduct
    that were provided by the complainant; iii) the foster mother’s description
    of the pattern of gradual disclosure had the ring of truth; and iv) he was
    satisfied that the foster mother did not try to persuade the complainant
    but, rather, simply encouraged the complainant in an indirect and unimposing
    way. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:
normal;'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    we agree that it would have been open to the trial judge to take a different
    view of the evidence, we see no basis for interfering with his findings or
    with his conclusion that the out-of-court statements met the reliability
    criterion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:
normal;'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to the main issue on appeal, the appellant argued that the trial
    judge erred in entering the foster mother’s notes of the out-of-court statements
    as exhibits on the trial. While we agree that it would have been preferable
    had the trial judge not done so, we see no indication that the trial judge
    used the notes for an impermissible purpose. In addition, we note that defence
    counsel at trial did not object to this procedure. In the circumstances,
    we would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:
normal;'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellant submitted that the verdicts are unreasonable. We disagree.
    On our review of the record, it was open to the trial judge to make the findings
    that he did concerning the credibility of the complainant’s mother and her
    foster mother. Further, having admitted the complainant’s out-of-court statements,
    it was open to the trial judge to rely on them even in the absence of corroboration.
    Accordingly, we reject this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:
normal;'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>
