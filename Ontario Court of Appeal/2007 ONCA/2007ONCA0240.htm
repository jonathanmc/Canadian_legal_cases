    appellant was convicted of one count of conspiracy to break and enter dwelling
    houses and of two counts of assault with intent to steal. He was sentenced to
    14 years imprisonment in addition to one year of credit for time served on the
    conspiracy count and to 10 years imprisonment concurrent on each of the assault
    with intent to steal charges. Pursuant to s. 743.6(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    the trial judge ordered that the appellant would not be eligible for parole
    until he has served one half of his sentence. The appellant raises two grounds
    of appeal against conviction and seeks leave to appeal sentence.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>We do not
    accept the appellant’s submissions concerning the adequacy of the trial judge’s <i>Vetrovec</i> instruction in relation to
    K. D. In a preceding instruction concerning assessing the credibility of
    witnesses generally, the trial judge alerted the jury to the need to consider a
    witness’s potential interest in the outcome of the case and of “the distressing
    but real possibility” that a witness could fabricate evidence for personal
    reasons. Subsequently, within the body of the <i>Vetrovec</i> instruction, the trial judge twice referred to “the circumstances
    [in] which [D.] testified”. </span>In addition, we note that c<span lang=EN-US>ounsel for the appellant confined his
    cross-examination of D. to the plea bargain issue. In these circumstances, it
    could not have escaped the jury’s attention that one of the concerns in relation
    to D.’s evidence was the possibility that he implicated the appellant in order
    to obtain favourable treatment for himself. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Further, as
    part of the <i>Vetrovec</i> caution, the
    trial judge told the jury explicitly that D. and the other unsavoury witness,
    D.R., had both acknowledged that they engage in robberies more or less as an
    occupation. In our view, taken as a whole, the trial judge’s instructions were
    adequate to alert the jury to the reasons why special scrutiny of D.’s evidence
    was necessary.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>On our review
    of the record, there was at least some evidence at trial capable of supporting
    D.’s evidence. For example, D.R. testified that the appellant told him that he
    (the appellant) sent Mitch Orra to British Columbia because Orra was being
    investigated and the appellant was concerned that Orra might say something
    about him. Orra was one of the individuals D. implicated in the Wood Road home
    invasion. Further, D.R. indicated he had gotten to know D., Orra and some of
    the other alleged participants in the Wood Road incident through the appellant.
    In addition, there was some evidence confirming a significant volume of
    telephone traffic between D. and the appellant in 2002. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Given this
    evidence, we conclude that the trial judge did not err by telling the jury that
    it was for them to determine whether there was any confirmatory evidence.
    Moreover, we conclude that the trial judge’s statement to the jury that, in his
    view, there was no other evidence to confirm D.’s evidence inured to the
    appellant’s benefit. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In our view,
    this is not one of those exceptional cases in which we should hold that the
    trial judge’s exercise of discretion in crafting the form of <i>Vetrovec</i> instruction was unreasonable.
    Read as a whole, the caution that was given in this case was quite strong. The
    trial judge told the jury that common sense indicated there was good reason to
    examine the unsavoury witnesses’ evidence “with <i>the greatest care and caution</i>.” [Emphasis added.] He also said,
    “You <i>should</i> look for some
    confirmation of their evidence from somebody or something else other than what
    each of them has to say before you rely upon their testimony….” [Emphasis
    added.]</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Further, as
    we have said, on our review of the record, there was some evidence capable of
    supporting D.’s testimony. Significantly, defence counsel at trial did not
    object to the form of instruction that was given. While we agree that the trial
    judge could have cautioned the jury in stronger terms, we are not persuaded
    that he committed reversible error by instructing the jury as he did.</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While we agree that the trial judge could have summarized the
    evidence relating to the defence position at trial more thoroughly, this case
    turned essentially on credibility and the trial judge’s instructions set out
    the essence of the appellant’s position, namely that he denied any involvement
    in a conspiracy and in the incidents in question. Notably, defence counsel at
    trial did not raise the objection that is being raised on appeal. In all the
    circumstances, we would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The conviction appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown concedes and we agree that the trial judge erred in
    principle by finding that the appellant’s testimony at trial was an aggravating
    factor on sentencing, that the appellant was not amenable to rehabilitation as
    a result and therefore that the objectives of denunciation and deterrence
    required delaying the appellant’s parole eligibility. In our view, the trial
    judge also erred in failing to give any weight to the appellant’s status as a
    first offender. Finally, while we agree that the appellant’s role in the
    offences for which he was convicted justified a significantly higher sentence
    than the sentences given to the other participants, taking account of the
    foregoing factors, in our view, the disparity in the sentences imposed was too
    great. </p>

    granted, the sentence imposed by the trial judge is set aside and a sentence of
    ten years imprisonment in addition to one year time served on the conspiracy
    count and eight years concurrent on each of the assault with intent to steal
    counts is substituted. We make no order under s. 743.6(1) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.</p>
