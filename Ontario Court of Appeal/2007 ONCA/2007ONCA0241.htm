  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol
    concentration exceeding 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.
    He was sentenced to seven months in custody. The appellant appeals both his
    conviction and sentence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    sole ground of appeal against conviction is that the designation of the
    qualified technician under s. 254(1) by the Minister of Public Safety and
    Security amounted to improper sub-delegation because the Minister was not the
    “lawful deputy” of the Solicitor General. The appellant makes two submissions
    on the sentence appeal: first, that the trial judge erred in imposing a
    sentence one month longer than the custodial term sought by both Crown and
    defence counsel; second, that the term of custody should be reduced because
    there was no space available at the correctional institute where it was
    understood he would be serving his sentence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'><b>The Designation of the
    Qualified Technician</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      On
    March 2, 2004, the appellant provided two breath samples to Peel Regional
    Police in response to a demand under s. 254(3) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. The samples were taken by Constable Wright, who had
    been designated a qualified technician under s.&nbsp;254(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> on May 20, 2003 by Robert
    W. Runciman, the Minister of Public Safety and Security at the time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      By
    Order in Council dated April 25, 2002, all of the powers and duties assigned by
    law to the Solicitor General were assigned and transferred to the Minister of
    Public Safety and Security, and the Minister was made responsible for the
    administration of the <i>Ministry of the
    Solicitor General Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.34.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant submits that the assignment and transfer of the powers of the
    Solicitor General to the Minister of Public Safety and Security constituted an
    improper re-delegation of the authority to designate qualified technicians, and
    the qualification of Constable Wright was therefore invalid. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      For
    the reasons that follow, we would not give effect to that submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       Parliament
    delegated to provincial Attorneys General and Solicitors General the power to
    designate qualified technicians under s. 254(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. The <i>Code</i> does not specify which official holds the office of Solicitor General; instead,
    that person is properly identified by reference to provincial legislation.
    Under the <i>Ministry of the Solicitor
    General Act</i>, the Solicitor General presides over and has charge of the
    Ministry and is responsible for the administration of the Act. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       Pursuant
    to the <i>Executive Council Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. E.25, the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario may appoint Ministers and
    prescribe their powers and duties. Those powers and duties may be assigned or
    transferred by Order in Council. The Order in Council assigning and
    transferring the powers of the Solicitor General to the Minister of Public
    Safety and Security did nothing more than change the title of the official
    responsible for carrying out the duties of the Solicitor General. In substance,
    the successor Ministers were and are the Solicitor General for the purposes of
    s. 254(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      This
    interpretation accords not only with the provisions of the federal and
    provincial <i>Interpretation Acts</i> but
    also with general principles of statutory interpretation, and common sense. The
    interpretation contended for by the appellant leads to the absurd result that
    the person charged with performing the duties of the Solicitor General would be
    disqualified from so doing simply by virtue of a change in title. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'><b>The Sentence Appeal</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals the length of his sentence, which
    exceeds by one month the term of custody sought by both Crown and defence
    counsel. The appellant submits that the length of sentence imposed was
    predicated on the understanding that space would be available to him in the
    Ontario Correctional Institute’s alcohol treatment program.  That space not being available, the
    appellant submits his sentence ought to be reduced to four months.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the submissions of Crown and defence counsel accorded
    on the length of the custodial term being sought, there was no joint submission
    on sentence in this case. The Crown did not join defence counsel in submitting
    that the appellant’s sentence should be served at the Ontario Correctional
    Institute, nor in seeking only the minimum three-year driving prohibition. The principles
    respecting joint submissions therefore do not apply.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentence imposed was not unfit. The sentencing judge had
    regard to the applicable sentencing principles and he considered the
    circumstances of both the offender and the offence. He noted that this was the
    appellant’s fourth conviction for driving over&nbsp;80, and that intermittent
    custodial sentences for the last two convictions had not deterred the appellant
    from reoffending. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge sought to fashion a sentence that would
    meet the appellant’s need for rehabilitation by ensuring that it was of
    sufficient length to qualify the appellant for incarceration at the Ontario
    Correctional Institute, and by making an urgent recommendation that his
    sentence be served there. He emphasized, however, that in his view the offence
    merited a seven month custodial sentence regardless of whether the appellant
    had access to that facility. We see no error in his reasons or in the length of
    sentence imposed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the appeal against conviction is dismissed;
    leave to appeal sentence is granted, but the appeal from sentence is dismissed.</p>
