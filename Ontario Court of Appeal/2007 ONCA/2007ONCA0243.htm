    respondent, S.D., a thirteen-year-old boy was convicted by Woolcott J. of
    various sexual offences arising out of a brief encounter with a four-year-old
    child.  He appealed to the summary conviction appeal court and Festeryga
    J. allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial.  On appeal to this court,
    Crown counsel submits that the appeal judge misapprehended his role and,
    in effect, retried the case or substituted his opinion about the credibility
    of the witnesses for the opinion of the trial judge.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    appreciate the grounds of appeal and the respondent’s response, a somewhat
    detailed review of the facts is required.  The mothers of the complainant
    and the respondent, Jessica S. and Cindy D. respectively, were close friends.  In
    addition, the respondent lived with his grandparents, who rented the top
    floor of Douglas S.’s (the complainant’s grandfather’s) home.  The sexual
    assault was alleged to have occurred on Father’s Day on June 15, 2003.  On
    that day, the complainant and her parents went to a barbeque at her grandfather’s
    home.  The respondent and his grandparents were also at the barbeque.  The
    next door neighbour Carol J., Jessica’s aunt, and her partner attended the
    barbeque for a period of time, perhaps two hours, and then returned to their
    own home for their own barbeque.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    allegation emerges most clearly from a videotaped interview by a police officer
    of the complainant that was admitted pursuant to s. 715.1 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.  She told the officer that while she was
    playing with the respondent, she asked him for a piece of gum.  He told her
    that she could have the gum if she had “sex” with him.  She seems to have
    agreed and the respondent put his penis in her mouth and partly in her anus
    and vagina.  The complainant said that the activity stopped when people were
    looking.  The Crown alleged that this assault occurred when the two children
    were playing at a play structure located in the next door neighbour’s backyard.  It
    will be recalled that the next door neighbour is the complainant’s mother’s
    [Jessica’s] aunt.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is a garage that divides the backyards of the two houses. As a result, the
    play structure in the aunt’s backyard cannot be seen from grandfather’s backyard,
    where the barbeque was being held.  However, it is possible to see the play
    structure from the driveway or if one was coming out of either the grandfather’s
    or the aunt’s house.  The play structure can also be viewed from the windows
    in the aunt’s house.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent testified and denied committing the offence.  He conceded that
    he was briefly playing with the complainant at the play structure shortly
    before the barbeque meal was served, but estimated this was only for five
    to ten minutes and during that time the aunt came and went from her home
    five or six times.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    allegation of sexual assault came to light two weeks after the barbeque.  Jessica
    was babysitting a friend’s two children, including an infant boy.  At one
    point, Jessica came into the bedroom and found the complainant on the bed
    with the infant, pulling down her pants.  Jessica questioned the complainant
    about this activity and put the complainant in her “time out” chair until
    she gave an explanation.  The complainant said she was “gonna sex him just
    like the little boy did to me”.  Jessica established that the little boy
    was the respondent, the boy who lived in the same house as the complainant’s
    grandfather.  The complainant told the story of what happened to her mother,
    and later her father, in much the same terms she later told the police officer.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    should be noted that when the police officer questioned the complainant as
    to when she told her mother about the incident, the complainant said that
    she had lied to her mother.  She refused to tell the officer what she had
    lied about and attempts to pursue this issue at trial proved fruitless.  The
    complainant also seemed to have some knowledge of sexual matters that did
    not come from the incident with the respondent.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
      REASONS OF THE TRIAL JUDGE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s reasons were the focus of the appeal to the summary conviction
    appeal court and are the focus of the further appeal to this court.  The
    trial judge accepted the complainant’s evidence and rejected the respondent’s
    evidence.  The trial judge noted that the respondent’s trial counsel conceded
    that the complainant was probably sexually assaulted by someone prior to
    the complaint implicating the respondent; the issue was whether it was the
    respondent who had sexually assaulted the complainant.  The trial judge found
    the number of details in the complainant’s story compelling, given her age
    and the passage of time.  She was satisfied that the questioning by the complainant’s
    parents did not affect the reliability of her account.  In the course of
    her evidence at trial, the complainant referred to the neighbour as “Debbie”,
    rather than Carol.  The trial judge did not consider this to be significant
    since it was apparent that the complainant had difficulty remembering names
    of people with whom she was not familiar.  The trial judge considered the
    complainant
    “unshakeable” in her identification of the boy with whom she had sex as the
    boy who lived at her grandfather’s house and held this had to be the respondent.  In
    addition, the trial judge found the respondent’s admission that the complainant
    asked him for gum to be an important detail that supported the complainant’s
    story.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge rejected the respondent’s evidence that he was only on the play
    structure with the complainant for five or ten minutes.  She considered this
    to be impossible because of the number of activities the respondent engaged
    in with the complainant and the number of times he claimed to have seen the
    aunt come and go from her home.  She concluded this evidence “was clearly
    an attempt by [the respondent] to minimize what his contact had been with
    [the complainant] on that date and in what context he had had that contact.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    considering whether there was opportunity to commit the offence, the trial
    judge placed particular reliance on the aunt’s evidence. Her critical findings
    as to opportunity to commit the offence are excerpted below:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>And I accept
    the evidence of [the aunt] that for a period of approximately two hours she
    and her partner visited in the backyard at [the grandfather’s home] and did
    not return to their property whatsoever.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It is fair to
    say that most usually these kinds of events take place in as private an atmosphere
    as the perpetrator can achieve. In this case, the backyard on [the aunt’s
    house] was accessible only through the driveway or the back door of the [aunt’s
    house]. It could be seen only from those vantage points [and] from through
    two windows, one in the dining room and one in the back room at [the aunt’s
    house]. <i>There were periods of time, approximately two hours that afternoon,
    when no one was in the [aunt’s] house so that the only way anyone in the
    backyard could be seen was if someone came into the yard from the driveway.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>I accept
      that for some two hours or more that date no one except possibly [the complainant]
      and [the respondent] were in the backyard at [the aunt’s house]. Over the
      course of that afternoon there would have been lengthy periods of time
      when there would be an expectation of privacy in that backyard given the
      absence of [the aunt] and her partner</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I would thus
    find that it would have been possible for the acts described by [the complainant]
    to have taken place between [the complainant] and [the respondent] without
    any one of the other persons socializing at [the grandfather’s backyard]
    or the residents of [the aunt’s house] to have observed these acts. Of course
    there is a difference between its having been possible and its having happened,
    but it is important on the basis of the evidence before this court to establish
    whether there was in fact any opportunity. In my view there was clear cut
    opportunity. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[The respondent],
    however, gave evidence not only that it did not happen but that the only
    time that he was in the backyard at [the aunt’s house] was at a time when
    there were people, i.e. [the aunt] and her partner, coming and going in the
    backyard. As I have indicated above, I do not accept the estimate of the
    length of time that [the respondent] was in the backyard which was offered
    by [the respondent]. I also do not accept that during the time that [the
    respondent] was in the backyard there was a constant coming and going of
    people in that backyard as suggested by [the respondent]. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge rejected the respondent’s denial of having committed the offence.  In
    the course of doing so, she noted that the respondent was clearly “concerned
    that he might go to jail for a long, long time.”  The trial judge went on
    to say that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In giving his
    evidence this anxiety or concern was apparent and in the court’s view clearly
    motivated him to shade his evidence in some aspects.  In giving his evidence
    he attempted to minimize his contact with [the complainant] and his role.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge was also critical of the respondent’s use of the phrase, “That
    I can remember,” which the trial judge considered to be “evasive”.  The trial
    judge found his evidence internally inconsistent and inconsistent with the
    evidence of witnesses whose evidence she did accept.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
      REASONS OF THE
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    APPEAL COURT JUDGE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal court judge recognized that he was required to “pay great deference” to
    the trial judge’s credibility assessments and was not entitled to substitute
    his conclusion on credibility for that of the trial judge.  The appeal court
    judge, however, held that the trial judge made two errors.  First, she held
    the respondent to the standard of an adult.  Second, she misapprehended the
    evidence with respect to the visibility of the yard where the children were
    playing and the opportunity to commit the offence, especially where there
    were many people coming and going during the barbeque.  The appeal court
    judge’s reasons were very brief and he did not elaborate on these errors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    view of these errors, the appeal court judge was satisfied that there had
    been a miscarriage of justice and he ordered a new trial.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
      GROUNDS OF APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown challenges both of the reasons of the appeal court judge for allowing
    the appeal.  Ms. Nakelsky submits that the trial judge did not err in her
    approach to the respondent’s evidence and did not misapprehend the evidence
    of opportunity.  She also submits that the appeal court judge, in effect,
    substituted his opinion for that of the trial judge.  Finally, she submits
    that the trial judge did not provide sufficient reasons.  I will deal with
    each of these issues in turn.  I will also deal with an issue that this court
    raised with counsel in the course of the hearing of the appeal concerning
    the use of evidence of the respondent’s desire not to go to jail.</p>

    begin with the question of the adequacy of the appeal court judge’s reasons
    because this issue is connected to the other grounds of appeal.  The Crown’s
    overall attack on the appeal court judge’s approach, that he substituted
    his opinion on credibility for that of the trial judge, is based, in part,
    on the failure of the appeal court judge to explain how the trial judge erred
    in the two areas he identified.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court of Canada has held that an intermediate appellate court commits
    an error in law if the deficiencies in the reasons prevent meaningful appellate
    review: See <i>R. v. Owen</i> (2003), 174 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at para. 60 (S.C.C.).  Also
    see <i>R. v. Minuskin</i> (2003), 181 C.C.C. (3d) 542 at paras. 3-5 (Ont.
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  The standard for measuring the adequacy of reasons derives, of course,
    from the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Sheppard</i> (2002),
    162 C.C.C. (3d) 298.  Of particular importance in this case are two of the
    propositions set out by Binnie J. in <i>Sheppard</i> at para. 55, namely:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>2.
      An accused person should not be left in doubt about why a conviction has
      been entered. Reasons for judgment may be important to clarify the basis
      for the conviction but, on the other hand, the basis may be clear from
      the record. The question is whether, in all the circumstances, the functional
      need to know has been met.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>10.
      Where the trial decision is deficient in explaining the result to the parties,
      but the appeal court considers itself able to do so, the appeal court's
      explanation in its own reasons is sufficient. There is no need in such
      a case for a new trial. The error of law, if it is so found, would be cured
      under the s.&nbsp;686(1)(<i>b</i>)(iii) proviso.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Standing
    on their own, the appeal court judge’s reasons do not explain why he found
    that the trial judge had applied an inappropriate standard for judging the
    credibility of the respondent and misapprehended the visibility evidence.  However,
    the submissions of counsel were transcribed and that transcript assists in
    understanding the appeal court judge’s concerns.  Whether those concerns
    are borne out by the trial judge’s reasons is another matter which I will
    deal with separately.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his submissions dealing with the misapprehension of evidence respecting visibility
    and opportunity to commit the offence, counsel for the respondent argued
    that the trial judge fundamentally misapprehended the evidence when she held
    in the passage quoted above that there was a two-hour period when there was
    no one in the aunt’s home and therefore “the only way anyone in the backyard
    could be seen was if someone came into the yard from the driveway”.  Counsel
    then reviewed the photographs that had been entered into evidence and the
    testimony that demonstrated that the aunt’s backyard, including the play
    structure, could be seen from the driveway; that it was not necessary to
    actually enter the yard.  Counsel for the respondent also reviewed the evidence
    that showed that there were frequent comings and goings from both homes that
    would have brought adults onto the driveway.  Finally, counsel reviewed the
    aunt’s evidence to show that she had not testified that she was in the grandfather’s

    respect to the ground of appeal concerning the assessment of the respondent’s
    evidence and whether the trial judge unfairly held the respondent to an adult
    standard, counsel for the respondent focused primarily on the assessment
    of the respondent’s time estimates.  The trial judge had rejected the respondent’s
    estimate that he was only on the play structure with the complainant for
    five or ten minutes because of his description of the number of events that
    occurred and the comings and goings of others during this period.  Counsel
    for the respondent argued that the trial judge applied a standard that would
    be applicable to an adult who was wearing a watch and timing events.  Counsel
    then contrasted that treatment of the respondent’s evidence with the treatment
    of his evidence that he would have no way of knowing when someone was coming
    into the backyard. That testimony was designed to show it was unlikely that
    the respondent would risk a sexual assault that involved removing his clothing
    and the clothing of the complainant.  In relation to that evidence the trial
    judge stated, “of course if he and [the complainant] were not doing anything
    wrong, there would not have been any reason even to think about whether someone
    would come into the yard.”  Counsel pointed out that the only time the trial
    judge applied a more relaxed child-centred standard to assessing the respondent’s
    evidence was to turn his immaturity against him.  The trial judge found it
    unlikely that he was mature enough to engage in the kind of reasoning suggested
    by his counsel; that since he would have no way of knowing when someone might
    come into the backyard he would not have risked engaging in the alleged conduct.  In
    general, it was counsel’s submission that the trial judge was very critical
    of minor inconsistencies in the respondent’s evidence but entirely forgiving
    of major problems with the complainant’s evidence.</p>

    counsel in her submissions before the appeal court judge argued that the
    trial judge had not misapprehended the evidence.  She submitted that it was
    open to the trial judge to find that there was a two-hour period when no
    one was coming and going from the aunt’s house.  She conceded that it is
    possible to see into the backyard from the driveway, but submitted that it
    was open to the trial judge to find that the area of the play structure where
    the complainant said the assault took place was not visible from at least
    one vantage point, the driveway.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    far as the alleged unfair treatment of the respondent’s evidence, Crown counsel
    submitted that the trial judge was not applying an adult standard.  Rather,
    she argued the trial judge had analyzed the evidence and found that the respondent
    was attempting to minimize his opportunity to have committed the offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, when the entire record is considered, the basis for the appeal court
    judge’s reasons allowing the appeal is reasonably clear.  The appeal judge
    accepted the respondent’s submission that the trial judge had misapprehended
    the evidence about visibility and opportunity.  His reasons for that finding
    are as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I also find,
    upon reading the entire reasons of the learned trial judge, that she misapprehended
    the evidence with respect to the visibility of the yard where the children
    were located and also the opportunity for the adult [sic] to commit the alleged
    acts, especially where there were many people coming and going during a barbecue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    when the entire record is examined it is apparent that the appeal court judge
    accepted the submission that the trial judge had applied too high a standard
    to the evidence of the respondent based on the examples provided by counsel
    and his own review of the record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the reasons of the appeal court judge are sufficient.  Those reasons,
    together with the submissions and the trial record, show why the appeal was
    allowed.  They allow for further appellate review.  The Crown in this court
    is in a position to argue that the reasons given by the appeal court judge
    are not borne out by the trial record and that, in reality, the appeal court
    judge substituted his view of credibility of the complainant and the respondent
    for the view of the trial judge.  I therefore turn to those issues.</p>

    my view, the appeal court judge erred in finding that the trial judge had
    misapprehended the evidence of opportunity.  The trial judge’s finding of
    opportunity was anchored in her understanding that the aunt and her partner
    were in the grandfather’s backyard for an uninterrupted period of two hours.  Since
    no one else was in the aunt’s home to look out the back windows, the only
    other way to see the part of the play structure where the offence was committed
    was by entering the aunt’s backyard.  The finding concerning this uninterrupted
    two hours is supported by the aunt’s evidence.  It was not unreasonable for
    the trial judge to accept this evidence.  There was no evidence of anyone
    else entering the aunt’s home during this time.  While the aunt was in and
    out of her home later while she and her partner were barbequing in their
    own backyard, this was after the assault allegedly occurred, when the complainant,
    the respondent and the others were in the grandfather’s backyard having their
    barbeque.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the question of visibility turned on what could be seen from the driveway.  It
    was the position of the defence that people were frequently in and out of
    the two houses and since neither house had a back door out to their respective
    backyards, adults would frequently be going onto the driveway.  The question
    of what could be seen from the driveway depended on the testimony of the
    witnesses and the photographic exhibits.  The trial judge had the advantage,
    denied the appeal court judge, of watching the witnesses as they pointed
    out on the photographs where various things happened.  This advantage is
    demonstrated most dramatically in this part of the trial judge’s reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[The complainant]
    claimed that the sexual contact took place on the grass at the corner of
    the play structure. My recollection of her evidence of the area that she
    pointed out during the course of looking at the photograph in court, was
    that the corner she identifies is at the back of the play structure away
    from the garage side of the play structure as that structure is depicted
    in Exhibit number 3.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was open to the trial judge to find that adults who were simply walking onto
    the driveway to access the side door of the grandfather’s house would not
    have been able to see the part of the play structure where the trial judge
    found the assault was committed.  Given her understanding of where the offence
    occurred, the trial judge did not misapprehend the evidence by stating that
    one had to enter the yard from the driveway.  The trial judge’s view of the
    evidence is also supported by the testimony of the aunt that she did not
    see the respondent and the complainant playing on the structure, notwithstanding
    there was uncontradicted evidence that at some point they were playing on
    the structure.  Although another trier of fact might have reached a different
    conclusion about visibility and opportunity, it cannot be said that the trial
    judge misapprehended the evidence.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(c)       Unfair

line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have said, the submission by the respondent before the appeal judge that
    the trial judge applied an adult or unfair standard to judge the respondent’s
    credibility turns primarily on the question of the respondent’s testimony
    that he was only with the complainant on the play structure for five or ten
    minutes.  The respondent’s counsel also made the submission before the appeal
    court judge that the trial judge while critical of the respondent’s evidence
    was very forgiving of the complainant’s evidence.  There is manifestly no
    merit to this latter submission.  The complainant was only four years old
    when she gave her statement to the police.  The standard to be used in understanding
    her evidence would have been significantly different from that employed to
    assess the evidence of the thirteen-year-old respondent.</p>

line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am of the view that the trial judge did not apply an inappropriate standard
    in judging the respondent’s credibility.  The trial judge gave extensive
    reasons for why she did not accept the respondent’s evidence.  It was not
    just his five-to-ten minute estimate, which the respondent clung to although
    given several chances to revise, but also his other evidence of lack of opportunity,
    which was inconsistent with other evidence accepted by the trial judge.  Most
    importantly, during the five-to-ten minute period the respondent claimed
    that the aunt was in and out of her house five or six times.  It was open
    to the trial judge to accept the aunt’s evidence that she did not see the
    respondent and the complainant at the play structure and that the only time
    she was frequently in and out of her house that afternoon was when she was
    preparing her own barbeque, a time when the respondent and the complainant
    were in the grandfather’s backyard.</p>

    the course of oral argument in this court, the court raised with counsel
    a portion of the trial judge’s reasons that were not referred to by the appeal
    judge.  Counsel made brief submissions during oral argument and then filed
    additional written submissions.  The part of the trial judge’s reasons in
    question is located where she deals with additional factors affecting the
    respondent’s credibility.  Before this the trial judge had dealt extensively
    with other aspects of the respondent’s version of events, most importantly
    his attempt to minimize his contact with the complainant.  The trial judge
    then continued as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Is [the respondent’s]
    version of events otherwise credible? It is clear from the evidence before
    the court that [the respondent] was concerned at the time that he was investigated
    for the matter.  <i>Indeed at some point in his evidence he told the court
    that he was concerned that he might go to jail for a long, long time. In
    giving his evidence this anxiety or concern was apparent and in the court’s
    view clearly motivated him to shade his evidence in some aspects</i>. In
    giving his evidence he attempted to minimize his contact with [the complainant]
    and his role. He underestimated his time at home, for example, before leaving
    for his friend … house in the morning. He says that was five minutes which
    seems logically impossible for what he had described as having done.  Again,
    that is an attempt to minimize the amount of time he would have had with
    respect to any possible contact with [the complainant]. He minimized the
    actual contact with [the complainant] in examination in-chief and it is only
    in cross-examination [that] he admitted to having hugged [the complainant],
    for example.  His manner of presenting this detail is telling since he prefaced
    the statement with the phrase, “That I can remember,” when admitting that
    he did hug her and he was thus evasive about the event. He used the same
    evasive phrase when confirming in cross-examination that when he left, “everything
    was good”. [Emphasis added.]</p>

    concern with the kind of comment made by the trial judge as to the respondent’s
    possible motive for falsely testifying is that the reasoning is inconsistent
    with the presumption of innocence.  The leading case in this province on
    this issue is <i><span lang=EN>R. v. B. (L.)</span></i><span lang=EN> (1993),
    82 C.C.C. (3d) 189 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  In that case, the trial judge stated: &quot;The accused, of course, has
    a motive for not telling the truth, he does not wish to be convicted.&quot;  Arbour
    J.A. held at p. 191 that this was an error:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>The
      impugned passage in the trial judge's reasons in this case, in my opinion,
      goes beyond the permissible consideration of the accused's interest in
      being acquitted, as one factor to be taken into account when weighing his
      testimony. <i>It falls into the impermissible assumption that the accused
      will lie to secure his acquittal, simply because, as an accused, his interest
      in the outcome dictates that course of action. This flies in the face of
      the presumption of innocence and creates an almost insurmountable disadvantage
      for the accused</i>. The accused is obviously interested in being acquitted.
      In order to achieve that result he may have to testify to answer the case
      put forward by the prosecution. However, it cannot be assumed that the
      accused must lie in order to be acquitted, unless his guilt is no longer
      an open question. <i>If the trial judge comes to the conclusion that the
      accused did not tell the truth in his evidence, the accused's interest
      in securing his acquittal may be the most plausible explanation for the
      lie. The explanation for a lie, however, cannot be turned into an assumption
      that one will occur</i>.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>The
      trial judge was entitled to believe the complainant and to disbelieve the

      an assumption of guilt. In my view, the trial judge misdirected himself
      on the crucial aspect of assessing the credibility of the appellant and

      court is that he or she does not wish to be convicted.  As noted in </span><i>B.

      relying on this assumption is a logically incoherent approach.  Both innocent
      and guilty accused have an interest in not being convicted, a trial judge

      reasons are read as a whole it is apparent that the trial judge for a number
      of well-founded reasons was satisfied that the respondent’s version of
