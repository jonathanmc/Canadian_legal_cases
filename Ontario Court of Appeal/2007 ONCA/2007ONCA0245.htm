  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Without being
    sealed and signed by the head of the council and the clerk as required by
    the law in most jurisdictions, the instrument is not a by-law whatever else
    it may be.  A by-law that has been passed by a council and which has not
    been sealed or signed as prescribed by statute is, for the time being, of
    no validity but, when so signed and sealed, it becomes effective. [Footnotes
    omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    Council’s proceedings of November 28 and January 9 are read in this light,
    it is apparent that Council did not intend to adopt a by-law at their November
    28 meeting.  It was a resolution directing city staff to prepare a by-law
    and to report to Council at its subsequent meeting.  In our view, therefore,
    the application judge erred in concluding that the by-law was passed on November
    28, 2005.  Only one by-law was passed, namely, By-law 2006-03, adopted on
    January 9, 2006.  It amended the former By-law 6609 by incorporating amendments
    approved on November 28, 2005, as well as further modifications approved
    on January 9, 2006.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the decision taken on November 28, 2005 was in the nature of a resolution
    to pass a by-law, and not the enactment of a by-law.  The application judge’s
    conclusion to the contrary was an error of law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Council
    knew that, because it had made changes to the proposal subsequent to the
    public meeting, s. 34(17) of the <i>Planning Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P 13
    required it to determine whether any further notice was required.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    staff report and January 9, 2006 resolution of Council contained a statement
    to the effect that the revisions are considered minor and that no additional
    public notice was required.  After considering this report, Council adopted
    the staff recommendation to amend the zoning by-law.  The respondents argue
    that we should interpret the statement in the report and resolution as referring
    only to the changes to the proposed by-law which were recommended in the
    staff report and not to the changes Council resolved to make on November
    28.  While we agree that such a reading may be possible, we nonetheless reject
    the submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Council’s
    resolution stipulated that “having considered the matters outlined in this
    report, no further public notice is required.”  The recommendations in the
    report as adopted by Council contained a list of all of the changes approved
    by Council by their November 28, 2005 resolution, as well as the clarifications
    and changes suggested by staff.  Accordingly, it is clear that Council considered
    the need for the public notice in respect of all of the changes and decided
    against it.  Pursuant to s. 34(17), Council had the power to make this decision
    both in respect of the staff changes and the November 28 changes.  We conclude
    that Council carried out its obligations under the statute and, before making
    its decision not to give further public notice, considered all of the modifications
    made to the original proposal.  Section 34(17) provides that this determination
    by Council is final and not subject to review.</p>

line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    turn now to the refusal to issue the building permit.  The interim control
    by-law put into place by the city had expired on December 6, 2005.  The changes
    to the zoning by-law were not made until January 9, 2006.  In the intervening
    period, the respondents sought the issuance of their building permit.  The
    city refused to do so for several reasons, including the fact that the appropriate
    plans had not been submitted with the application.  The deficiencies noted
    were not corrected until some time in February, by which time the new zoning
    by-law had been passed and the respondents’ proposal was non-compliant.  In
    these circumstances, we see no basis for ordering the city to issue the building
    permit sought by the respondents.</p>

line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, the appeal is allowed and the decision of the application judge
    is set aside.  Since this appeal was argued by the appellants on a different
    basis from that argued before the application judge and in the factum filed
    on this appeal, we award no costs here or on the original application.</p>
