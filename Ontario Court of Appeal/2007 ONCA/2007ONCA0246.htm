  <p class=headingtitle>SIMMONS J.A.:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    a trial before O’Flynn J. sitting with a jury the respondent was found guilty
    of procuring a young woman to become a prostitute and living partially off
    the avails of prostitution of a person under the age of 18 years. These crimes
    related to the same victim and were the respondent’s tenth and eleventh prostitution-related
    convictions. Following the verdicts, the Crown applied to have the respondent
    declared a dangerous offender.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the statutory criteria for a dangerous offender designation
    were satisfied. However, he concluded that before the respondent could be
    declared a dangerous offender, in addition to the statutory criteria, the
    Crown had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there is no reasonable
    possibility of eventual control of the risk the respondent presents in the
    community. As he was not persuaded that the Crown had satisfied that burden,
    the trial judge dismissed the dangerous offender application, declared the
    respondent a long-term offender and imposed a three-year sentence (in addition
    to four years’ credit for time served) plus a ten-year supervision order. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant
    to s. 759(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, C.-46, the Crown appeals
    from the order dismissing the dangerous offender application. The Crown submits
    that, in exercising his discretion concerning whether to declare the respondent
    dangerous, the trial judge erred in law by placing an onus on the Crown to
    prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there is no reasonable possibility of
    eventual control of the risk the respondent presents in the community. The
    Crown contends that but for this legal error, a dangerous offender designation
    was inevitable. The Crown therefore asks this court to set aside the trial
    judge’s order and to substitute an order declaring the respondent a dangerous
    offender. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the alternative, the Crown contends that the trial judge erred in law by
    failing to provide any reasons for finding that the risk the respondent presents
    can eventually be controlled in the community and asks this court to set
    aside the trial judge’s order and direct a new dangerous offender hearing.
    Finally, in the event this court rejects its appeal from the dismissal of
    the dangerous offender application, the Crown submits that the custodial
    sentence imposed by the trial judge is demonstrably unfit and asks this court
    to increase the period of incarceration to the maximum available penalty. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    way of response, the respondent submits that the legal test applied by the
    trial judge was correct. In any event, he submits that the trial judge erred
    in finding that the statutory criteria for a dangerous offender designation
    were satisfied and, in addition, claims that there were other grounds upon
    which the trial judge could have relied to exercise his discretion not to
    declare the respondent dangerous. The respondent therefore asks that this
    appeal be dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    I agree that the trial judge erred in imposing a burden on the Crown to prove
    beyond a reasonable doubt that there is no reasonable possibility of eventual
    control in the community of the risk the respondent presents, for reasons
    that I will explain, in my view, it is necessary that there be a new dangerous
    offender hearing. I would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the trial
    judge’s order and direct a new dangerous offender hearing.</p>

    respondent was found guilty of procuring and living partially off the avails
    of prostitution of a person under the age of 18 years on February 18, 2003.
    He was acquitted of charges of sexual assault and sexual assault with a weapon
    concerning the same victim. Directed verdicts of not guilty were entered
    on other related charges.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    predicate offences arose out of events that occurred between June and September
    1998. At the time, the appellant was on parole in relation to a nine-year
    sentence imposed in March 1991. The victim, seventeen-year-old E.G., was
    an unemployed single mother on welfare. She was approached by the respondent
    shortly after moving to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Kingston, while dancing at a nightclub. He told her he had a business proposal
    for her, that she was attractive, that he could get her a house, a car, and
    lots of money, and that all she had to do was “sell herself”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the first day she went to work for him, the respondent told E.G. to give
    him the money she received from each client for safekeeping. At the end of
    the night, E.G. asked for her money back but the respondent refused, saying
    that he spent it on drugs. E.G. continued to work for the respondent out
    of fear from June 1998 until the respondent was hospitalized on September
    6, 1998. She was too afraid to go to the police at that time but did so later.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent underwent major surgery in September 1998, returned home on September
    24, 1998 and continued to receive home nursing care until December 1998.
    He was arrested on September 9, 1999 after attempting to procure fourteen-year-old
    C.K., and has been in custody ever since.</p>

    respondent has 26 criminal convictions dating back to 1977. As noted, he
    had nine previous convictions for prostitution-related offences and he received
    penitentiary sentences of 6 and 9 years respectively for two sets of such
    offences. He has nine convictions for crimes of violence and has committed
    numerous offences while on bail or parole.</p>

    September 1985 the respondent was convicted of living off the avails of prostitution
    in relation to S.W. during the period January to December 1983. The respondent
    had been living with S.W. for 7 1/2 years at the time and had three children
    with her. There was evidence at the dangerous offender hearing that during
    conversations with various health care professionals the respondent admitted
    hitting S.W. and threatening her to get her to work as a prostitute. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent was convicted of living off the avails of prostitution in relation
    to 14-year-old J.B. in March 1985. Evidence at the dangerous offender hearing
    indicated that the respondent was on bail for the charges in relation to
    S.W. when he procured J.B. to work as a prostitute during a two-day period
    in July 1984. There was some evidence at the dangerous offender hearing indicating
    that J.B. was afraid of the respondent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    November 1985 the respondent was convicted of attempting to procure 19-year-old
    D.B. and attempting to live off the avails of prostitution in relation to
    her during a two-day period in January 1985. The respondent was on bail for
    the charges in relation to S.W. when he sexually seduced D.B., took her to
    Montréal and attempted to make her work as a prostitute. Evidence at the
    dangerous offender proceeding indicated that D.B. was able to call home and

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent was released to a halfway house on day parole in January 1988.
    While under supervision at the halfway house, the respondent used cocaine
    and gambled daily, and regularly attended nightclubs. During this period,
    he also started pimping S.D., procured and pimped W.W., and began pimping
    C.G. In November 1988, he went unlawfully at large.  He took S.D. with him
    and continued to pimp her in western

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent was convicted of several offences in relation to C.G. and W.W.
    on March 18, 1991 and was sentenced to a total of nine years in the penitentiary.
    The evidence indicated that the respondent threatened to kill 20-year-old
    C.G. regularly and that on one occasion he grabbed her by the throat with
    one hand and put a knife to her throat with the other hand. The evidence
    also indicated that the respondent beat 24-year-old W.W. and threatened to
    kill her, her family and her three children. One night, he punched W.W. between
    the eyes, knocking her unconscious. Two months later, he punched her in the
    left eye, opening a wound which bled profusely. The impact also shattered
    W.W.’s contact lens. W.W. was later diagnosed as having a concussion and
    a severe infection in the left eye. She required surgery to treat the infection
    and to repair the skull area around the eye that had collapsed from the impact.
    She was also informed that her nose was broken from the earlier assault.
    While she was in the hospital, the respondent called her daily to ensure
    that she would not make a statement to the police. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent was never charged with any offences in relation to S.D., whom
    he married in 1990.  However, evidence at the dangerous offender hearing
    indicated that the respondent physically abused his wife and also forced
    her to prostitute herself. He once kicked her in the face, fracturing her
    nose. On approximately 10 occasions, he whipped her with a hanger while she
    was naked. He also whipped her with an extension cord. On one occasion he
    tied her up for 10 hours while she was naked.</p>

    January 2001, the respondent was convicted of attempting to procure 14-year-old
    C.K. in the period between July and September 1999. After being introduced
    to C.K., the respondent obtained her telephone number and called her at home.
    He invited her to work as a prostitute but she declined. He subsequently
    met with her, called her repeatedly and threatened to hurt her or to kill

    respondent was born on August 13, 1960 in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto. He described his father as a gangster who abused him and his family;
    he described his sisters as prostitutes and drug addicts. When the respondent
    was 11 or 12, he was sent to live with his uncle who was a pimp. As a 15-year-old
    teenager, he began to rely on pimping as a lucrative source of financial
    support. He quit school in grade 9, has no employment history and has gambling
    and drug addictions.</p>

    records filed at the dangerous offender hearing for the period October 1997
    to December 1999 demonstrated that the respondent had undergone significant
    hospitalization, operations and treatment for Crohn’s disease and for a debilitating

    addition to reports of numerous assessments conducted while the respondent
    was incarcerated, Dr. Hucker, for the Crown, and Dr. Bradford, for the respondent,
    provided psychiatric evidence at the dangerous offender hearing. Dr. Hucker
    and Dr. Bradford both diagnosed the respondent as having an antisocial personality
    disorder and as being a psychopath. Further, both indicated that the respondent
    was a moderate-high to high risk to re-offend violently, most likely in the
    context of the sex trade industry.</p>

    be so tight that I can't imagine what it would be”. Dr. Hucker’s opinion
    was that there was not a “fairly good chance that his behaviour will be controlled
    within an appropriate time within the community”. He said it would be very
    difficult to monitor the respondent and that there was no foundation upon
    which he could say that at some point within the foreseeable future the respondent
    would be a “fairly good chance for a safe release to the community”.</p>

    Bradford expressed reservations in his report about whether, from a legal
    perspective, the respondent meets the statutory criteria for a dangerous
    offender. In particular, he noted that the respondent had never been convicted
    of a sexual assault and that the degree of violence in the offences he committed
    was relatively low compared to what Dr. Bradford had seen in other dangerous
    offender applications. However, Dr. Bradford concluded that the respondent&rsquo;s
    chance of being rehabilitated was poor. He said:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Mr. [D.] has very severe
    problems, a poor prognosis and very little chance of a successful rehabilitation
    in the attainment of a pro-social lifestyle. This is based on the severe
    antisocial personality disorder that he presents with for which there is
    very little optimism for any response whatsoever to treatment. In addition,
    he clearly has problems related to sexual attraction to adolescent females
    as well as having evidence of a sexually sadistic preference for the same
  age group.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Bradford testified that, while it was inaccurate to say that there was absolutely
    no treatment for the respondent, the chances were
    “extremely slim for any treatment to be effective.” He said that assuming
    that past programs had had some effect on him, the respondent would have
    to stay away from the sex trade industry and be monitored in such a way to
    make returning to it impossible. There would have to be random urine tests,
    treatment for substance abuse and treatment for gambling. These factors,
    in addition to his age and health, may reduce his risk to re-offend. The
    respondent's biggest barrier to success was his severe personality disorder.
    Dr. Bradford said it would require a “cognitive restructuring” and that “it
    requires a total commitment on behalf of the person undergoing the treatment”.</p>

    with the 1997 amendments to the dangerous offender provisions. They provide
    the court with discretion to find that an offender is a long-term offender
    where the court is satisfied that three criteria set out in s. 753.1(1) of
    the<i> Criminal Code</i> are met. Those criteria require that the court be
    satisfied: i) that it would be appropriate to sentence the offender to a
    period of imprisonment of at least two years; ii) that there is a substantial
    risk that the offender will reoffend; and iii) that there is a reasonable
    possibility of eventual control of that risk in the community. If the court
    finds an offender to be a long-term offender it shall impose a sentence of
    imprisonment for a minimum of two years and order the offender to be supervised
    in the community for a period not exceeding ten years: s. 753.1(3).</p>

    this court noted in <i>H.(M.B.)</i>, <i>supra</i>, it is clear from the Supreme
    Court of Canada’s decision in <i>R. v. Johnson</i>, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 357,<i> </i>that
    where the Crown brings a dangerous offender application, the sentencing judge
    must first consider whether the Crown has established the statutory criteria
    in either s. 753(1)(a) or s. 753(1)(b) for declaring the offender dangerous.
    If the Crown has not satisfied that burden, the dangerous offender application
    cannot succeed. If the Crown has satisfied that burden, the sentencing judge
    then has the discretion not to declare the offender dangerous and, in exercising
    that discretion, must consider whether any available sanction short of a
    determinate sentence would adequately protect the public, including a long-term
    offender designation.</p>

    already noted, the trial judge dismissed the Crown’s dangerous offender application
    and declared the respondent a long-term offender. Before turning to his analysis,
    he reviewed certain aspects of the evidence adduced at the hearing, the general
    law applicable to dangerous offender and long-term offender applications,
    and the positions of the parties. As part of this review, he referred to <i>Johnson</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    and noted that the court retains the discretion not to declare an offender
    dangerous even where the statutory criteria are met. He also noted that,
    in seeking to have the respondent declared dangerous, the Crown relied on
    both ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and 753(1)(a)(ii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then set out his analysis as follows: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>I find the offender, Mr.
  [D.], meets the criteria for both a dangerous offender and a long-term offender.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Section 753.1(1)(c) requires
    the Court to consider, despite the offender&rsquo;s substantial risk to re-offend,
    whether there is a &ldquo;reasonable possibility&rdquo; of eventual control
    of the risk in the community. If the result of that analysis is that there
  is no such possibility, then the offender is designated a dangerous offender.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span class="headingNUMBER" style="line-height:normal;">There
      are certain concerns on the part of the doctors as to the treatability
      of Mr. [D.] </span>. <u>The Crown

    of eventual control of the risk presented by <span class="headingNUMBER" style="line-height:normal;">[Mr.
    D.]</span> in the community.</u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><u>Mr. [D.] does not have
      to prove he is treatable. The Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt
      that he is not treatable.</u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><u>I am not satisfied beyond
      reasonable doubt, considering all the evidence and in particular the evidence
      of Dr. Bradford, that Mr. [D.] is not treatable.</u> I am satisfied that
      the criteria in section 753.1(1)(a)(b)(c) have been met.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>I hereby find Mr. [D.] to
  be a long-term offender pursuant to section 753.1(1).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>I am exercising my discretion
  and not declaring Mr. [D.] to be a dangerous offender. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>IV. Analysis</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>i) Did the trial judge
      err by placing an onus on the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt

    main issue on appeal is whether, in exercising his discretion whether to
    find the respondent a dangerous offender, the trial judge erred by placing
    an onus on the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there is no
    reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk the respondent presents
    in the community. One of the three statutory criteria for a long-term offender
    designation requires that the court be satisfied there is a reasonable possibility
    of eventual control in the community of the risk an offender presents. Expressed
    differently, the main issue on appeal is whether the trial judge erred in
    law by placing an onus on the Crown to negative the availability of a long-term
    offender designation before declaring the respondent a dangerous offender. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    fairness to the trial judge, in the court below the Crown agreed that it
    bore the burden set out above. Nevertheless, I conclude that the trial judge
    erred in law in imposing this burden. In my view, the trial judge’s approach
    is inconsistent with the Supreme Court of Canada’s analysis in<i> Johnson</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    which addresses the relationship between the dangerous offender and long-term
    offender provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Johnson</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    one of the primary issues<i> </i>was whether a sentencing judge retains the
    discretion not to declare an offender dangerous where the offender meets
    the dangerous offender criteria set out in either s. 753(1)(a) or (b) of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i>. The British Columbia Court of Appeal had concluded
    that there was no such discretion, but that a sentencing judge must consider
    the prospects for treatment or cure in order to determine whether an offender’s
    pattern of conduct is sufficiently intractable to satisfy the statutory criteria
    for a dangerous offender designation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court of Canada concluded that a sentencing judge does retain the
    discretion not to declare an offender dangerous even though the offender
    meets the statutory criteria. In addition to the permissive language in s.
    753(1), the Court relied on the following factors: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings;'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    primary purpose of indeterminate detention under the dangerous offender regime
    is the protection of the public, but it is warranted “only insofar as it
    actually serves [that] purpose”; and </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings;'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    dangerous offender provisions form part of the <i>Criminal Code </i>sentencing
    regime. The underlying objectives of the sentencing regime mandate the existence
    of the discretion to impose a just and fit sentence in the circumstances
    of the individual case. Further, the interpretation of the dangerous offender
    provisions must be governed by the fundamental purpose and principles of
    sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    regard to the principles of proportionality and restraint, the Court held
    that an indeterminate sentence should only be imposed where lesser sanctions
    would be insufficient to adequately protect the public from the risk of harm
    presented by a dangerous offender. The Court said:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>The principles of sentencing
    thus dictate that a judge ought to impose an indeterminate sentence only
    in those instances in which there does not exist less restrictive means by
    which to protect the public adequately from the threat of harm, <i>i.e.</i>,
    where a definite sentence or a long-term offender designation are insufficient. <u>The
    essential question to be determined, then, is whether the sentencing sanctions
    available pursuant to the long-term offender provisions are sufficient to
    reduce this threat to an acceptable level, despite the fact that the statutory
    criteria in s. 753 (1) have been met.</u> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Court concluded that it is possible that some offenders will satisfy both
    the dangerous offender and long-term offender criteria and that an offender
    cannot be declared dangerous and sentenced to an indeterminate period of
    detention where the threat to the public “can be reduced to an acceptable
    level” through the long-term offender provisions:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><u>In order for the sentencing
      sanctions available pursuant to the long-term offender provisions to reduce
      the threat associated with an offender who satisfies the dangerous offender
      criteria to an acceptable level, it must be possible for the same offender
      to satisfy both the dangerous offender criteria and the long-term offender
      criteria...</u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Almost every offender who
    satisfies the dangerous offender criteria will satisfy the first two criteria
    in the long-term offender provisions…In a certain percentage of those cases
    there will also be a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk
    in the community. <u>In those instances in which the offender currently constitutes
    a threat to the life, safety or physical or mental well-being of other persons
    yet there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk in
    the community, an offender will satisfy the criteria in both the dangerous
    offender and long-term offender provisions.</u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>In those instances where
    both the dangerous and long-term offender provisions are satisfied, it may
    be that the sentencing sanctions available under the long-term offender provisions
    are capable of reducing the threat to the life, safety or physical or mental
    well-being of other persons to an acceptable level... <u>If the public threat
    can be reduced to an acceptable level through either a determinate period
    of detention or a determinate period of detention followed by a long-term
    supervision order, a sentencing judge cannot properly declare an offender
    dangerous and sentence him or her to an indeterminate period of detention. </u>[Emphasis

'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, placing an onus on the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt
    that there is no reasonable possibility for eventual control of the risk
    an offender presents in the community in the context of a dangerous offender
    application would be inconsistent with <i>Johnson</i>, <i>supra</i>. <i>Johnson</i> holds
    that a sentencing judge may exercise the discretion not to declare an offender
    dangerous where the long-term offender criteria are met. Those criteria include
    the requirement that the sentencing judge be satisfied that there is a reasonable
    possibility of eventual control of the risk that an offender presents in
    the community. If the sentencing judge is uncertain whether that requirement
    is satisfied, <i>Johnson</i> indicates that the sentencing judge should refuse
    to exercise the discretion not to declare the offender dangerous based on
    the long-term offender provisions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    in the light of <i>Johnson</i>, I am not persuaded that the cases on which
    the respondent relies provide sound authority for holding that there should
    be an onus on the Crown in dangerous offender applications to prove beyond
    a reasonable doubt that there is no reasonable possibility of eventual control
    of the risk that an offender presents in the community. The respondent relies
    on the following cases that have held that such an onus exists: <i>R. v.
    B.R.B.</i>(2002), 174 B.C.A.C. 243; <i>R. v. A.P.A.</i> (2003), 184 B.C.A.C.

    the extent that these cases articulate a rationale, it appears to be rooted
    in jurisprudence interpreting the dangerous offender provisions as requiring
    the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an offender’s pattern of
    conduct is substantially or pathologically intractable in order to satisfy
    the dangerous offender criteria and equating that requirement with the impugned

    was the approach taken by British Columbia Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. Johnson</i> (2001),
    159 B.C.A.C. 255. At para. 58, the court referred to the following comments
    made by La Forest J. in <i>R. v. Lyons</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309 at para.
    43, concerning s. 687 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34,
    Part XXI , a predecessor to the current s. 653:   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Also explicit in one form
    or another in each subparagraph of s. 687 is the requirement that the court
    must be satisfied that the pattern of conduct is substantially or pathologically
    intractable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    para. 72 of its decision in <i>Johnson</i>, <i>supra</i>, the British Court
    of Columbia Court of Appeal interpreted these comments as meaning that treatment
    prospects had to be considered at the designation stage and that it would
    therefore be illogical to require the sentencing judge to examine treatment
    prospects once again as part of a residual discretion not to declare an offender
    dangerous. However, this approach was not adopted by the Supreme Court of
    Canada in its decision in <i>Johnson</i>. Accordingly, I am not persuaded
    that I should follow the authorities on which the respondent relies.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    in its post-<i>Johnson</i> decision in <i>R. v. Wormell</i> (2005), 198 C.C.C.
    (3d) 252 (B.C.C.A.) leave to appeal refused [2005] S.C.C.A. No. 371, the
    British Columbia Court of Appeal held that there is no onus on the Crown
    in a dangerous offender proceeding to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that
    there is no reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk an offender
    presents in the community. Both Southin J.A. and Ryan J.A. indicated that
    it is not appropriate to approach the issue of whether there is a reasonable
    possibility of eventual control of the risk an offender presents in the community
    from the perspective of who bears the burden of proof. In particular, Ryan
    J.A. stated the following:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>It follows that I agree
    with Madam Justice Southin when she says that it is not right to approach
    s. 753.1(1) with the burden of proof at the back of one’s mind. Such an approach
    was found not to be right in <i>R. v. Proulx</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, 2000
    SCC 5, 140 C.C.C. (3d) 449, when the court dealt with the language of the
    conditional sentence provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. Section 742.1
    of the <i>Code</i> permits a sentencing judge to impose a conditional sentence,
    if, among other things, the court “<u>is satisfied</u> that serving the sentence
    would not endanger the safety of the community”. (Emphasis added.) With respect
    to that language Lamer C.J.C. said this, at paras. 120-21:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>The wording used in s. 742.1
    does not attribute to either party the onus of establishing the offender
    should or should not receive a conditional sentence. To inform his or her
    decision about the appropriate sentence, the judge can take into consideration
    all the evidence, no matter who adduces it…</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>In matters of sentencing,
    while each party is expected to establish elements in support of its position
    as to the appropriate sentence that should be imposed, the ultimate decision
    as to what constitutes the best disposition is left to the discretion of
    the sentencing judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>For reasons that I will
    explain below, I agree with these comments. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the context of a dangerous offender application, the issue is whether the
    sentencing judge should exercise the discretion not to declare an offender
    dangerous after the sentencing judge has found that the offender satisfies
    the statutory criteria for that designation. As I have explained,<i> </i>the
    sentencing judge may exercise that discretion where he or she is satisfied
    that the public threat can be reduced to an acceptable level through either
    the long-term offender provisions or a determinate sentence. This is not
    an issue that requires either party to satisfy a burden of proof; rather,
    it is an issue for the sentencing judge concerning whether to exercise his
    or her discretion based on the whole of the evidence adduced. Moreover, given
    the requirement that an assessment report under s. 752.1(2) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> be filed as a pre-condition to making either a dangerous offender
    designation or a long-term offender designation, I see little risk that the
    sentencing judge will be left without evidence addressing the issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In
    the context of a stand-alone long-term offender application, the language
    of the statute appears to suggest a burden on the Crown to prove affirmatively
    that there is a reasonable prospect of eventual control of the offender in
    the community: e.g. see <i>R. v. Currie</i>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 260 and<i> R.
    v. Guilford</i> (1999), 44 W.C.B. (2d) 523 (Ont. S.C.J.). However, in my
    view, the requirement in s. 753.1 that there be a reasonable possibility
    of eventual control of the risk the offender presents in the community is
    of a different character than the first two criteria in that section and
    I do not agree that it is necessary to approach this criterion as imposing
    a burden of proof. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first two criteria in s. 753.1 are similar to the criteria in the dangerous
    offender provisions. They speak to the level of risk the offender is likely
    to pose in the future having regard to the offender’s past conduct.  They
    also establish the justification for subjecting an offender to a special
    sentencing regime based on the need for public protection. Accordingly, these
    are matters that the Crown should properly bear the onus of proving on the
    standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    way of contrast, the third criterion in s. 753.1 is not a justification for
    subjecting an offender to the long-term offender sentencing regime. Rather,
    it appears to be aimed solely at addressing whether the offender qualifies
    for a long-term offender designation as opposed to the more onerous dangerous
    offender designation. Importantly, as with the dangerous offender provisions,
    the long-term offender provisions give a sentencing judge a residual discretion
    to forego the more onerous designation where a lesser sanction would be sufficient
    to protect the public from the risk the offender presents. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    I note that, in addition to <i>Proulx</i>, <i>supra</i>, there are other
    cases that have held that a requirement that a court be “satisfied” of a
    particular matter does not necessarily connote a standard of proof beyond
    a reasonable doubt. See, e.g. <i>R. v. M.(S.H.)</i> (1989), 50 C.C.C. (3d)
    503 (S.C.C.), in which McLachlin J. noted that the concept of a standard
    of proof is “typically concerned with establishing whether something took
    place” and is “less helpful”
    when one is engaged in balancing various factors and considerations. See
    also   <i>R. v. A.O; R. v. J.M.</i>, [2007] O.J. No. 800 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Viewed
    in the context of the foregoing factors, I see no necessity or rationale
    for viewing the third criterion in s. 753.1 as imposing a burden of proof. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>ii) Is it necessary that
      there be a new dangerous offender hearing?</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    parties argue that a new dangerous offender hearing is unnecessary.  The
    Crown relies on the trial judge’s finding that the respondent meets the dangerous
    offender criteria and contends that there was no evidence capable of supporting
    a finding that there was a reasonable possibility of eventual control in
    the community.  The respondent relies on the trial judge’s finding that he
    meets the long-term offender criteria as a complete answer to the Crown’s
    position.  In addition, the respondent contends that the trial judge erred
    in holding that he meets the dangerous offender criteria and that, in any
    event, there were other grounds upon which the trial judge could have relied
    to decline to declare the respondent dangerous.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, it is necessary that there be a new dangerous offender hearing.
    The trial judge’s reasons span approximately 64 pages. However, his analysis
    is limited to what is reproduced in para. 37 above and he made no findings
    of fact. Given these circumstances and the context of this case, in my view,
    the trial judge’s conclusions are not amenable to proper appellate review.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the trial judge found that the criteria for a long-term offender designation
    in s. 753.1 were satisfied, it is not clear whether his finding was premised,
    at least in part, on his erroneous conclusion that the Crown had failed to
    meet its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that there is no reasonable
    possibility of eventual control of the risk the respondent presents in the
    community. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent submits that the facts of the predicate offences were not of the
    same character as his prior offences and, therefore, it was not open to the
    trial judge to find a pattern of conduct sufficient to warrant a dangerous
    offender designation. In addition, the respondent contends that there was
    no evidence capable of supporting a finding that the respondent’s conduct
    had or would cause such severe psychological harm or physical injury as to
    warrant a dangerous offender designation. I do not accept the respondent’s
    submission that these findings were unreasonable. However, I conclude that
    the trial judge’s failure to make findings concerning these issues and in
    relation to Dr. Bradford’s evidence concerning whether the respondent’s conduct
    warrants a dangerous offender designation, and his failure to explain the
    basis on which he exercised his discretion to decline to make a dangerous
    offender designation requires that there be a new dangerous offender hearing.</p>
