    be heard on March 1, 2007, on the respondent’s undertaking not to transfer
    the appellants in the meantime.  The appellants’ application sought a writ

    argument, he concluded as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Here the transfer
    is from one minimum-security institution.  There are differences between
    the two facilities, but, in my judgment, to use the words of Mr. Justice

    a court will find that minimum-security inmates cannot be housed in a multi-level
    institution, but that is not something that I can decide, today. [Emphasis

    application judge then purported to adjourn the appellants’ application to
    April 13 so that the respondent could file full responding materials, the
    appellants could file two additional affidavits, and cross-examinations could
    be conducted if desired.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

    appellants appeal from the order of March 1, arguing that they have a right
    to appeal because the application judge decided the merits of their application
    with the finding quoted above, and refused to issue the writ of <i>habeas</i> <i>corpus</i> that
    they sought.  On the merits of the appeal, they say that the writ should
    have issued and that pending its return for a full hearing, they should be
    kept at IMH.  </p>

    its part, the respondent seeks to quash the appeal, arguing that the application
    judge merely issued an interlocutory order to adjourn, from which there is
    no appeal to this court.  In the alternative, the respondent says that the
    appellants have not made out the <i>prima</i> <i>facie</i> case required
    to have the writ issued.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the appellants have a right of appeal to this court.  Sections 784(3)
    and (5) provide the statutory foundation for appeals from the refusal of
    a writ of <i>habeas</i> <i>corpus</i>.  They reflect the traditional two-stage
    approach where, if the applicant meets the threshold of raising an arguable
    case, the writ issues, and on its return there is a full hearing on the merits.  These
    sections provide a right of appeal if the writ is refused at the first stage
    or if the application is dismissed at the second stage.  Those sections read
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>784(3) Where
    an application for a writ of habeas corpus as subjiciendum is refused by
    a judge of a court having jurisdiction therein, no application may again
    be made on the same grounds, whether to the same or to another court or judge,
    unless fresh evidence is adduced, but an appeal form that refusal shall lie
    to the court of appeal, and where on the appeal the application is refused
    a further appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court of Canada.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>784(5) Where
    a judgment is issued on the return of a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum,
    an appeal therefrom lies to the court of appeal, and from a judgment of eh
    court of appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, with leave of that Court,
    at the instance of the applicant or the Attorney General of the province
    concerned or the Attorney General of Canada, but not at the instance of any
    other party.</p>

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place

      <i>United States of America</i></st1:country-region>
    <i> v. Desfosses</i>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 326 Sopinka J. described the effect
    of these subsections this way:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Sections 784(3)
    and (5) embody a compromise.  If a writ was refused at the first stage and
    no hearing was had on the merits, then an appeal as of right lay to the court
    of appeal, and if the appeal failed the appellant was entitled to an appeal
    as of right to this Court.  In return, the unsuccessful applicant could not
    make successive applications to other judges once the writ was refused by
    a judge.  This was subject to the proviso with respect to fresh evidence.  Under
    s. 784(3) the applicant could exhaust his or her appeals without securing
    a hearing on the merits.  This will occur if the applicant cannot meet the
    threshold required for the issue of the writ.  The required threshold is
    that there are “probable and reasonable grounds” for the complaint that the
    detention is unlawful.  See R. v. Olsen, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 296, at p. 298.  Section
    784(5) sets out the rights of appeal if the writ is issued and a hearing
    on the merits has been held.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the decision of the application judge on March 1 clearly constitutes
    a refusal of the appellants’ application for the writ of <i>habeas</i> <i>corpus</i>.  His
    conclusion that there would be no deprivation of their liberty if they were
    transferred from IMH to GVI is fatal to their application and his refusal
    to make an order as to where the appellants reside denies them the very relief
    sought.  The decision is in substance a refusal of the writ.  In the face
    of this, there would be nothing left to debate on April 13, the date to which
    the application was purportedly adjourned.  I would therefore dismiss the
    respondent’s motion to quash the appeal, given that the order of March 1
    constitutes a refusal to issue the writ.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Turning
    to the merits of the appeal, the appellants submit that on the evidence before
    the court on March 1, they meet the threshold of “probable and reasonable
    grounds” required for the writ to be issued.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    agree.  While much of that evidence may be ultimately contested when the
    merits are heard on the return of the writ, at this stage the threshold is
    met.  The appellants’ material is enough to establish at this point that
    their transfer would <i>prima</i> <i>facie</i> constitute a deprivation of
    liberty and is arguably unlawful.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Their
    evidence makes an arguable case that the perimeter security to which they
    would be subjected is significantly greater since GVI is surrounded by a
    chain-link fence topped with razor wire, while IMH has no perimeter security
    fence.  Similarly, they say that within the confines of the perimeter security
    at GVI, prisoners’ movements are significantly more restricted than at IMH
    in a variety of ways.  They submit that, in effect, the transfer would constitute
    a change in their security classification from true minimum security to something
    akin to medium security without the justification for such a change required
    by the <i>Corrections and Conditional Release Act</i>.  Further, they say
    that the transfer is unlawful and violates their rights under the <i>Charter
    of Rights and Freedoms</i>, particularly section 15.  Unlike women, male
    prisoners have available facilities that house only minimum security prisoners.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Putting
    these together, I conclude that the appellants have met the threshold of
    showing probable and reasonable grounds for their complaint that the transfer
    would constitute unlawful detention.  The application judge erred in not
    so finding.  I conclude that the writ should issue.  As the parties have
    been working towards a hearing on April 13, I would make that the date for
    the return of the writ. </p>

    its return for a full hearing on the merits, the appellants remain under
    the authority of the writ.  See R.C. Hurd: <i>At Treatise on the Right of

    Liberty and on the Writ of Habeas Corpus</i>, W.C. Little &amp;
    <st1:place w:st="on">

style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is obvious that if the objective of the habeas corpus procedures are to be
    achieved, the return of a writ should be as soon as possible after its issue
    so that the liberty interests of the applicant are determined without delay.  It
    is clear that the court’s determination of where an applicant is held in
    this intervening period of time is best done on a case by case basis in light
    of the particular circumstances.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Where
    the writ is issued after the alleged unlawful detention begins, the applicant
    is frequently left in the same place pending the return, often because the
    most important consideration is a want of alternatives.  However, as in this
    case the writ can be issued prospectively prior to an imminent detention
    that is said to be unlawful.  See <i>Idziak</i> <i>v.
    <st1:country-region

      Canada</st1:country-region>

    balance the relevant considerations in exercising its discretion.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, the application judge made no order about where the appellants

    my view, given the relevant considerations in this case, the court should
    exercise its discretion to order that the appellants continue to be held
    at IMH until the return of the writ. First, the commencement date for that
    stage is now only a week away. Second, a transfer to GVI would undoubtedly
    carry significant disruption that is best put off until a determination of
    the merits to avoid the risk of a second disruptive move back to IMH if the
    application were to be successful. Third, while it is by no means a conclusive
    factor, a transfer to GVI at this stage would constitute a <em>prima
    facie</em> unlawful
    deprivation of liberty for the appellants.  </p>

    the other side of the scales is the greater cost burden on the respondent
    to continue to house the appellants at IMH.  While this factor is not enough
    to tilt the scales against the status quo at this point, it will be up to
    the judge charged with the full hearing to revisit where the applicants should
    be held if that hearing is unduly prolonged.</p>
