style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant appeals against conviction on four grounds.  First, he argues that
    the opinion evidence proffered by the Crown from an expert on domestic abuse
    was inadmissible because it failed to meet the criterion of necessity outlined
    in <i>R. v. Mohan</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9 and its prejudicial effect outweighed
    its probative value.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the appellant claims that the trial judge’s instructions to the jury on the
    limited permissible use of this expert’s evidence were flawed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    the appellant says that the trial judge’s charge to the jury on the complainant’s
    prior inconsistent statements and on her two allegedly prior consistent statements
    was deficient.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    the appellant asserts that the trial judge erred by declining to grant a
    mistrial when the jury was accidentally provided with a copy of a handwritten
    note on an exhibit that was not part of the evidence at trial, the contents
    of which the appellant claims were both inflammatory and highly prejudicial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    would reject these submissions.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>I.          Admission
      of Expert Evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    witness in question was qualified as an expert in domestic violence “in order
    to give opinion evidence about the tendency of victims of domestic violence
    to maintain contact with [their alleged abuser] and to recant during the
    trial process”.  Evidence of this type was information outside the experience
    and knowledge of the jury.  At its core, it was evidence of some of the behaviours
    of victims of domestic abuse who suffer from a pattern of prolonged abuse.  This
    was not evidence that could be given by the complainant.  Moreover, it was
    open to the trial judge to conclude that this was not information within
    the common purview of a jury’s knowledge.  The trial judge ultimately concluded
    that the evidence was both relevant and necessary.  We see no error with
    this conclusion.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>II.        Instructions
      Concerning Expert Evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nor
    do we accept that the trial judge erred in his instructions to the jury on
    the limited permissible use of this opinion evidence.  In both a mid-trial
    instruction and in a four-page final instruction to the jury, the trial judge
    clearly directed the jury that it was free to accept all, none or part of
    the expert’s evidence but that if it did accept the expert’s evidence, the
    evidence could not be used as proof that the allegations against the appellant
    were true.  Although the trial judge told the jury that the expert’s evidence
    would be helpful so that the jury would not draw “adverse inferences” based
    on stereotypical reasoning, the trial judge also cautioned the jury: that “you
    cannot use the expert’s testimony to confirm that the violence happened in
    this case because the conduct of the complainant fit the so-called pattern
    such as recantation and continued contact”; that the opinion of the expert
    was not binding on the jury; and that it was for the jury to decide the facts.  Viewed
    in their entirety, these instructions were adequate.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;
text-underline:none'>III.       Instructions Regarding Prior Inconsistent</span></h4>
  <h4><span
style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>and Consistent Statements</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
page-break-after:avoid'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    relation to the prior inconsistent statements, the appellant argues that
    the charge was inadequate because it failed to adequately detail the inconsistencies
    and to point out that the prior inconsistent statements were made while the
    complainant was under oath.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    disagree.  The charge made clear the circumstances under which the prior
    inconsistent statements had been made.  Those circumstances included the
    complainant lying in her testimony at the bail hearing, at the preliminary
    inquiry, and in her sworn affidavit.  There can be no doubt that the jury
    understood that the prior inconsistent statements were made while the complainant
    was under oath.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    relation to the amount of detail given, we note that a trial judge need not
    review individually each prior inconsistent statement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, the charge adequately and fairly instructed the jury on the complainant’s
    prior inconsistent statements and the use that could properly be made of
    them.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    also do not think that the trial judge erred by not giving a limiting instruction
    with respect to the complainant’s prior consistent statements to the police
    and her doctor relating to being choked by the appellant.  These statements
    were not offered by the Crown as proof of the underlying facts.  See <i>R.
    v. Demetrius</i> (2003), 179 C.C.C. (3d) 26 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at para. 22.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>IV.       Failure
      to Declare a Mistrial</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge directed the jury that the handwritten note on the exhibit in
    issue formed no part of the evidence.  Moreover, he twice told the jurors,
    in blunt terms, that they were to disabuse their minds of this writing.  It
    is difficult to imagine a clearer caution.  It was more than sufficient to
    meet the possible prejudice to the appellant occasioned by the provision
    of the handwritten note to the jury.  As a result, we see no basis to interfere
    with the discretionary decision of the trial judge to deny a mistrial.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>V.        Disposition</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the result, the appeal against conviction is dismissed.</p>
