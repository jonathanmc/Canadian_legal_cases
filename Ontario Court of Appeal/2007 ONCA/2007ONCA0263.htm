      entered by Justice Bernard J. Manton of the Superior Court of Justice,
      sitting with a jury, on June 22, 2000 and the sentence imposed on December
      18, 2000</span><span

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BY THE COURT:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was convicted of second degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment
    with no parole eligibility for fifteen years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons set out below, we are satisfied that the conviction for murder
    cannot stand.  Crown counsel indicated that should the appeal be allowed,
    she was not seeking a new trial for murder and is content that we substitute
    a manslaughter conviction.  Similarly, the appellant is content that we enter
    a conviction for manslaughter.  In our view, this is an appropriate disposition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raised five grounds of appeal.  Given our disposition of this appeal,
    we find it necessary to refer to only one of the grounds of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the instructions to the jury with respect to the element of intent
    necessary to found a conviction for murder were flawed.  Towards the beginning
    of the portion of the charge pertaining to murder, the trial judge read s.
    229(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> to the jury.  He then read s.  229(c).  That
    provision is as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>229.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Culpable
    homicide is murder </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(c)  where a
    person, for an unlawful object, does anything that he knows <i>or ought to
    know </i>is likely to cause death, and thereby causes death to a human being,
    notwithstanding that he desires to effect his object without causing death
    or bodily harm to any human being.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge explained s. 229(c) as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Section 229(c)
    deals with homicide which occurs while a person commits another unlawful
    object.  If a person does anything for an unlawful object that he knows <i>or
    might know </i>is likely to cause death, and the death results from this,
    it is culpable homicide.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is well-established that liability for murder cannot be based on any <i>mens
    rea</i> less than subjective foresight.  Accordingly, the part of s. 229(c)
    allowing for conviction upon proof that the accused ought to have known that
    that death was likely to result is unconstitutional:  <i>R. v. Martineau</i> (1990),
    58 C.C.C. (3d) 353 at 362-363 (S.C.C.).  The trial judge should not have
    referred to the unconstitutional language in his charge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later
    in the charge, the trial judge summarized his instructions to that point
    on the essential ingredients on a charge of murder as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>For the Crown
    to succeed on a charge of murder, it must prove beyond a reasonable doubt
    the following ingredients:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>          1.  The
    identity of Mr. Salt as the offender.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>          2. The time and place of the offence as set out in the indictment.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>          3.
    That Mr. Salt committed an unlawful act.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>          4.That the unlawful act caused the death of Mr. Dufresne.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    list was incomplete in that it did not include the need for subjective intent.  However,
    subsequently, the trial judge did repeat the language of s. 229(a) which
    requires subjective intent.  He did not refer to s. 229(c) again.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, defence counsel made a number of objections to the charge, one of
    which referred only very briefly to s. 229(c) and to the trial judge’s use
    of the language “or might know would cause the death”.  The objection, however,
    did not direct the trial judge’s attention to <i>Martineau</i> or the unconstitutionality
    of the objective intent language in s. 229(c).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    the objections were completed, the jury asked a question about the essential
    elements of murder.  The trial judge recharged the jury the following day.  He
    repeated that the essential ingredients for murder were those set out in
    para. 8, above.  Again, at this point in his instruction he made no mention
    of the need to establish subjective intent.  Later in his recharge, the trial
    judge correctly told the jury that for second degree murder, the Crown must
    prove the appellant meant to cause the deceased’s death or else meant to
    cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause death and was reckless
    as to whether death ensued.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    hearing further submissions, the trial judge called the jury back and instructed
    them as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It was brought
    to my attention that I may have missed something during my charge and although
    I did speak to you yesterday regarding intention on murder, I want to tell
    you this, all murder, that is first or second degree, requires that the person
    who caused the death of a human being either intended to cause his death
    or intended to cause him bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause death
    and was reckless whether death ensued or not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jury retired and returned a verdict of guilty of second degree murder two
    days later.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown argues that the second recharge cured any confusion in the earlier
    instructions about the need for subjective intent. We would agree with this
    submission except that this recharge was not in fact the last word on the
    issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    some point during the charging process, the jurors were given copies of certain
    sections of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, including s. 229(c).  It appears that
    the unconstitutional words in s. 229(c) “or ought to know” were not deleted
    from the copies given to the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    say it appears because a copy of what was given to the jury is not available.  However,
    a fair reading of the transcript indicates that the jury very likely received
    documents with the unedited version of s. 229(c).  Indeed, there were discussions
    about editing certain other provisions, but not s. 229(c).  No one now suggests
    that a properly edited version of s. 229(c) was given to the jury.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    being the case, it then becomes necessary to assess the impact on the jury
    of receiving the unedited version of s. 229(c).  For the reasons that follow,
    we are of the view that it would be unsafe to assume the jury did not attach
    importance to it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    start, the jury was out for two days after the trial judge’s final recharge
    on the issue of intent.  There was a very real likelihood that members of
    the jury would, over time, attach more importance to the sections of the <i>Code</i> provided
    to them in writing than to the oral instructions from the trial judge.  At
    one point during the charging process, the jury had asked for a French version
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i> sections.  Moreover, the trial judge did not
    tell the jury in his oral instructions to disregard his initial instructions
    with respect to s. 229(c).  Indeed, the fact that the jurors were provided
    with a written copy of the section would reasonably lead them to conclude
    that they should consider the section. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    can well imagine that as the deliberation process continued, members of the
    jury would be inclined to focus on the precise language of the sections that
    they had been given in writing.  It is worth noting that the Crown’s theory
    was that the appellant was involved in killing of the deceased during the
    course of kidnapping and forcible confinement which are unlawful acts.  It
    would not have been unreasonable for the jury to have specific regard to
    s. 229(c), which sets out the elements of unlawful object murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fact that the jury was provided with an unedited version of s. 229(c), resulted
    from an unfortunate oversight.  In fairness to the trial judge he did not
    get much help from counsel who were asked to prepare the copies of the sections
    to be given to the jury and who did not point out the problem with the language
    in s. 229(c).  While defence counsel did raise an objection with respect
    to the section, she was not specific about what needed to be done to cure
    the problem.  Be that as it may, we are satisfied that the potential that
    some of the jurors were misled as to the need for subjective intent for a
    murder conviction is sufficiently real that the appellant’s conviction for
    second degree murder cannot stand.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ordinarily,
    it would be necessary to order a new trial for murder, there being some evidence
    to support a conviction for murder.  However, as we have said, the Crown
    does not seek a new trial for murder and is content that we substitute a
    manslaughter conviction as is the appellant.  In our view, this is an appropriate
    disposition.  While there was evidence on which a jury could convict of second
    degree murder, the evidence of the subjective intent necessary for a conviction
    for murder was not strong.  There was substantial evidence to support a conviction
    for manslaughter.  Indeed, the Crown accepted a plea to manslaughter from
    the other individual who was charged with this offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    the events giving rise to the conviction are now over ten years old.  The
    trial took place in 2000.  The appellant has been in custody for over ten
    years.  Clearly, a new trial could be very difficult for both sides.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties have made a joint proposal as to sentence for manslaughter.  We think
    the proposal is reasonable.  The appellant spent four years and five months
    in pre-trial custody and has served six years and three months since the
    time of sentencing.  If the pre-trial custody were to be credited on a two-for-one
    basis, the appellant has served the equivalent of over fifteen years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties agree that the appropriate sentence for a manslaughter conviction
    at the time of trial would have been eight years in addition to pre-trial
    custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, by exercising the authority given to us under ss. 686(1)(b)(i)
    and 686(3) of the <i>Code</i>, we dismiss the appeal against conviction and
    substitute a conviction on a charge of manslaughter.  We sentence the appellant
    to eight years imprisonment commencing on December 18, 2000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    we would like to thank counsel for the effective way that they presented
    their arguments and the sensible way that they approached the disposition
    of this appeal.</p>
