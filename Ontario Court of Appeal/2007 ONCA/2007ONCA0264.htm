      police searched the four men and the interior of the car.  They found two
      guns (later determined to be pellet guns) and four knives in the clothing
      of the men or inside the car.  The police opened the car trunk and found
      a knapsack with a loaded sawed&#8209;off shotgun inside.</span></p>

      respondent was charged with eight weapons&#8209;related offences.  At his
      trial, a <i>voir dire</i> relating to the legality of the searches took
      place.  The trial judge, Matlow&nbsp;J., ruled that the searches of the
      respondent and the interior of the car were lawful searches incident to
      arrest.  However, he held that the search of the car trunk violated s.&nbsp;8
      of the <i>Charter</i>.</span></p>

      trial judge then excluded the evidence relating to the shotgun under s.&nbsp;24(2)
      of the <i>Charter</i> on the basis that “[t]here is nothing in the evidence

      result of the trial judge’s s.&nbsp;8/s.&nbsp;24(2) ruling was that the
      respondent was acquitted of six of the eight charges in the indictment.  Later,
      he was also acquitted of the other two charges, relating to a pellet gun
      and a knife, because the trial judge was not convinced that they came within
      the definition of “weapon” in s.&nbsp;2 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</span></p>

      Crown appeals, principally on the basis that the trial judge erred in both
      components of his s.&nbsp;8/s.&nbsp;24(2) ruling.  The Crown contends that
      the search of the car trunk was a lawful search incident to arrest.  The
      Crown also submits that, even if this search were unreasonable, the evidence
      relating to the shotgun should have been admitted under a proper application
      of the <i>Collins</i> test:  see <i>R. v. Collins</i> (1987), 33 C.C.C.
      (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).  The Crown seeks an order for a new trial on all counts.</span></p>

      in the morning of December&nbsp;13,&nbsp;2003, the respondent was in the
      driver’s seat of his father’s vehicle with three other men.  The vehicle
      was parked, but running, in the parking lot of an apartment building.  Andre
      Martin (“Martin”) was in the front passenger seat.  The police were looking
      for Martin as they suspected that he was in breach of his probation order,
      which prohibited him from being in the area.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

      12:58&nbsp;a.m., two officers observed the vehicle.  The officers suspected
      that the occupants of the vehicle were committing offences under the <i>Liquor
      Licence Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;L.19, and that they were in possession
      of and smoking marijuana.</span></p>

      approached the front passenger, while Constable&nbsp;Burleau approached
      the respondent.  Constable&nbsp;Judd realized that Martin was the front
      passenger and identified himself as a police officer.  At 1:03&nbsp;a.m.,
      Martin was arrested for failing to comply with his probation order.  When
      asked if he had any weapons, Martin revealed that he had a large knife
      on his right side tucked into his pants.  Constable&nbsp;Judd notified
      Constable&nbsp;Burleau that Martin had a weapon on him.  When Martin was
      searched, a gun was located in his front waistband.  At 1:12&nbsp;a.m.,
      Martin was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon.  Constable&nbsp;Judd
      later determined that the gun was a pellet gun. </span></p>

'><span lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Meanwhile,
      Constable&nbsp;Burleau asked to see the respondent’s driving documents
      and then told him to turn off the engine of the car.  After Constable&nbsp;Burleau
      was informed that Martin had a weapon in his possession, he asked the respondent
      to step out of the vehicle.  At that point, what appeared to be a handgun
      fell out of the respondent’s pant leg.  At 1:04&nbsp;a.m., the respondent
      was arrested for possession of a firearm.  When Constable&nbsp;Burleau
      picked up the gun, he realized that it might be a pellet gun.  The respondent
      was patted down, but no other weapons were found.  When he was searched
      again at the police station, a knife with a three&#8209;inch blade was
      found hidden in his pants.</span></p>

      the respondent and Martin were being arrested and searched, the two men
      in the back of the vehicle were told to put their hands on their heads.  Constable&nbsp;Burleau
      testified that the men in the back were placing their hands underneath
      the seat and moving around suspiciously.  Back&#8209;up was called and
      arrived at 1:06&nbsp;a.m.  The new officers who arrived, Chant and Ellis,
      were informed that two handguns had been located.  Constable&nbsp;Chant
      opened the rear door on the passenger side to effect an arrest for possession
      of firearms in a motor vehicle.  He saw the passenger trying to kick a
      large knife under the seat in front of him.  The passenger was taken from
      the vehicle, arrested, handcuffed and searched.  Constable&nbsp;Ellis went
      to the rear door on the driver’s side and saw that passenger trying to
      conceal an item, which turned out to be another large knife.</span></p>

      all four passengers had been arrested and secured, Constable&nbsp;Tait,
      who arrived at the scene at 1:08&nbsp;a.m., and Constable&nbsp;Chant searched
      the vehicle.  Constable&nbsp;Tait located a large kitchen knife on the
      back seat and an Exacto knife on the floor behind the driver’s seat.  Constable&nbsp;Chant
      found a large knife on the floor of the back of the vehicle.</span></p>

    then proceeded to the trunk of the car where he found a blue backpack.  When
    he pulled the bag out of the trunk, the respondent said: “Ah, shit.  Here
    we go.  This should be interesting.”  Inside the backpack, Constable Chant
    found a sawed&#8209;off shotgun with a shell chambered in the ready&#8209;to&#8209;fire
    position.</p>

      respondent was indicted on eight counts: counts 1 and 2 – carry a concealed
      weapon (knife and pellet gun); and counts 3 to 8 – various offences related

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
      the respondent’s trial, a combined <i>Charter</i> application and <i>voir
      dire</i> was held to determine the admissibility of the evidence obtained
      as a result of the searches of the respondent’s person and the car trunk,
      as well as the admissibility of the oral statement attributed to the respondent
      during the search of the car trunk.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge ruled that the search of the respondent was a lawful search
      incident to arrest.  Accordingly, counts 1 and 2 relating to carrying concealed
      weapons (a knife and a pellet gun) could proceed.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However,
      although the trial judge found that the search of the interior of the car
      was lawful, he ruled that the search of the car trunk violated s.&nbsp;8
      of the <i>Charter</i>, which provides:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>8.         Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable
      search or seizure.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge described the car trunk as “a place where the accused was entitled
      to expect respect for his right to privacy.”  He concluded that the Crown
      had failed to demonstrate any “valid reason why such a search had to be
      done immediately without the authority of a warrant.”  He found that neither
      safety nor destruction of evidence were live issues in the circumstances
      because the car could have been “detained for a reasonable period of time
      while a search warrant was sought, and if one were obtained, the evidence
      could still have been discovered.”  He concluded:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>There was no reasonable expectation
      that the police might find something in the trunk that could lend weight
      to the proof of charges that would be laid as a result of the arrests already
      effected.  Because of the nature of those charges, all of the relevant
      evidence to support them had already been found and seized.  I am satisfied
      that Officer&nbsp;Chant’s only purpose in carrying out the search was to
      attempt to uncover evidence of additional crimes for which no evidence
      had already been discovered and for which no reasonable basis for any belief
      that had occurred already existed.  In my view, the search was based only
      on hunch or speculation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge further ruled that the evidence obtained pursuant to the search
      of the car trunk should be excluded pursuant to s.&nbsp;24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>,
      which provides:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>24.(2) Where, in proceedings under subsection (1), a court concludes
      that evidence was obtained in a manner that infringed or denied any rights
      or freedoms guaranteed by this Charter, the evidence shall be excluded
      if it is established that, having regard to all the circumstances, the
      admission of it in the proceedings would bring the administration of justice
      into disrepute.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge reasoned:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There is nothing in the evidence which persuades
    me that there was any mitigating factor which might explain or lessen the
    seriousness of his <i>Charter</i> violations.  Although the situation facing
    Officer&nbsp;Chant upon his arrival to the scene may well have been challenging
    for him and the other officers who were present, the intensity of that diminished
    enormously by the time the search of the trunk commenced and it ought to
    have been possible for trained and experienced officers such as those who
    were present to confer, if necessary, and determine and apply the law of
    search and seizure correctly.  Inexplicably, they did not do this and the
    consequence must be that all evidence of what was found in the trunk must
    be excluded.  This, in my view, is the only proper remedy to grant to the
    accused pursuant to Section&nbsp;24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge ruled that the respondent’s oral statement – “Ah, shit.  Here
    we go.  This should be interesting.” – was, although voluntary, also inadmissible
    because it was provoked by the unlawful search of the car trunk and discovery
    of the shotgun.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    effect of the trial judge’s ruling was that all evidence relating to the
    shotgun was excluded and the respondent was acquitted of counts 3 to 8 in
    the indictment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later
    in the trial, the trial judge acquitted the respondent of counts 1 and 2
    relating to carrying concealed weapons (the knife and pellet gun).  He found
    that these items were concealed by the respondent but that the Crown had
    not proven that they came within the definition of “weapon” in s.&nbsp;2
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>

      to arrest must still be reasonable within the meaning of s.&nbsp;8, as
      set out in <i>Collins</i>, <i>supra</i>.  The search will be reasonable
      only if it is authorized by law, the law is reasonable, and the search
      is conducted in a reasonable manner.  A search conducted incident to arrest
      will be authorized by law if it meets the requirements set out in <i>R.
      v. Stillman</i> (1997), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.).  First, the arrest
      must be lawful.  Second, the search must be truly incidental to arrest.  Third,

      starting point for the legal analysis of this question is the decision
      of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Cloutier v. Langlois</i> (1990), 53
      C.C.C. (3d) 257.  Justice </span>L’Heureux-Dubé, writing for a unanimous
      court, surveyed the English and American common law and stated at p.&nbsp;274:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[I]t seems beyond question that the common law
    as recognized and developed in Canada holds that the police have a power
    to search a lawfully arrested person and to seize anything in his or her
    possession or immediate surroundings to guarantee the safety of the police
    and the accused, prevent the prisoner’s escape or provide evidence against
    him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    court justified the power to search incident to arrest as necessary to attain
    the “ultimate purpose of criminal proceedings
    … to convict those found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt” (p.&nbsp;275).  While
    the court held that reasonable and probable grounds are not required in order
    for the police to conduct a search incident to arrest, the power does have
    restrictions.  Specifically, the court set out the following three principles
    that apply to searches incident to arrest at p.&nbsp;278:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1. This power does not impose a duty.  The police
    have some discretion in conducting the search.  Where they are satisfied
    that the law can be effectively and safely applied without a search, the
    police may see fit not to conduct a search.  They must be in a position to
    assess the circumstances of each case so as to determine whether a search
    meets the underlying objectives. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2. The search must be for a valid objective in
    pursuit of the ends of criminal justice, such as the discovery of an object
    that may be a threat to the safety of the police, the accused or the public,
    or that may facilitate escape or act as evidence against the accused.  The
    purpose of the search must not be unrelated to the objectives of the proper
    administration of justice, which would be the case, for example, if the purpose
    of the search was to intimidate, ridicule or pressure the accused in order
    to obtain admissions. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3. The search must not be conducted in an abusive
    fashion and, in particular, the use of physical or psychological constraint
    should be proportionate to the objectives sought and the other circumstances
    of the situation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ultimately,
    the court concluded that the frisk search in question in that case was justified.  The
    officers had carried out the search for the valid purpose of ensuring officer
    safety.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court of Canada had another opportunity to consider the reasonableness
    of a search incident to arrest in <i>R. v. Caslake</i> (1998), 121 C.C.C.
    (3d) 97.  An officer had seen the accused in a grassy area on the side of
    the road where a bag containing nine pounds of marijuana was subsequently
    found.  The accused was stopped in his vehicle on the highway and arrested
    for possession of marijuana.  Six hours after the arrest, an officer went
    to the garage where the vehicle had been towed and conducted a search without
    a warrant or the consent of the accused.  The officer found $1,400 in cash
    and two packages of cocaine.  The accused was convicted of possession of
    marijuana for the purposes of trafficking and possession of cocaine.  He
    appealed from his conviction on the cocaine offence, arguing that the search
    was unlawful and the cocaine should not have been admitted. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are several aspects of the <i>Caslake</i> decision that are relevant to the
    present appeal.  First, Lamer C.J.C., writing for the majority, indicated
    that the power to search incident to arrest is not confined to the accused’s
    person; it extends to motor vehicles (para. 15).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    Lamer C.J.C. emphasized that “the search is only justifiable if the purpose
    of the search is related to the purpose of the arrest” (para. 17).  The court
    noted that this connection was missing in <i>R. v. Belnavis</i> (1996), 107
    C.C.C. (3d) 195 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), aff’d (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 405 (S.C.C.), where an arrest for traffic
    fines did not authorize the search of a car for evidence of stolen property
    (para 18). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the court repeated that the three main purposes for a search incident to
    arrest are “ensuring the safety of the police and public, the protection
    of evidence from destruction at the hands of the arrestee or others, and
    the discovery of evidence which can be used at the arrestee’s trial” (para
    19).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Caslake</i>,
    the evidence was that the officer conducted the search of the car because
    of an R.C.M.P. policy requiring that an inventory be taken of the contents
    of all impounded cars.  Therefore, the search was not conducted for a valid
    purpose and it was held to be unreasonable.  The court did indicate at para.
    26 that if the officer’s objective had been different, the search might have
    been reasonable:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Had Constable Boyle searched the car, even hours
    later, for the purpose of finding evidence which could be used at the appellant’s
    trial on the charge of possessing marijuana for purpose of trafficking, this
    would have been well within the scope of the search incident to arrest power,
    as there was clearly sufficient circumstantial evidence to justify a search
    of the vehicle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    fact, the situation that the Supreme Court hypothesized in <i>Caslake</i> presented
    itself before this court in <i>R. v. Polashek</i> (1999), 134 C.C.C. (3d)
    187.  In that case, the accused was pulled over because of a highway traffic
    violation.  While the officer was speaking to the accused, he detected the
    smell of marijuana.  The officer asked the accused to exit his vehicle and
    conducted a quick search of the accused’s person.  Cannabis resin was found
    in the accused’s pocket and the officer placed him under arrest for possession
    of marijuana.  The officer then continued the search of the accused and found
    over $4,000 in cash.  After the accused was handcuffed and placed in the
    police cruiser, two officers searched the interior of the car, including
    the glove compartment and the trunk of the car.  Bags of marijuana, a scale,
    rolling tobacco and a small amount of L.S.D. were located in the trunk.  At
    that point, the accused was arrested for possession of a narcotic for the
    purpose of trafficking. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    of the issues on appeal in <i>Polashek</i> was whether the search of the
    vehicle was reasonable.  Relying on <i>Caslake</i>, Rosenberg J.A. held that
    the search was a lawful search incident to arrest.  He said at para. 26: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In <i>Caslake</i> at p. 65, Lamer C.J.C. also held
    that for search to be “truly incidental to the arrest”, where the justification
    for the search is to find evidence, “there must be some reasonable prospect
    of securing evidence <i>of the offence for which the accused is being arrested</i> [emphasis
    in original]”.  In my view, the search of the trunk of the vehicle fell within
    the scope of the common law power.  The appellant was arrested shortly after
    being removed from the vehicle that he was driving.  A lawful search of his
    person disclosed a quantity of cannabis resin and a large amount of money.  He
    had been stopped in an area known to the officer for drug trafficking.  In
    those circumstances, there was a reasonable prospect that the officer would
    find more drugs or narcotics in the vehicle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
    in <i>Polashek</i> the court found that after the accused had been arrested
    for possession of marijuana, it was reasonable in the circumstances for the
    police to search his car to find more drugs.  The second search would clearly
    be based on, in the language of <i>Caslake</i> at para. 25, “some reason
    related to the arrest”.</p>

      privacy interest of the respondent with respect to the car trunk was, in
      my view, miniscule.  The car was not the respondent’s; it belonged to his
      father.  Moreover, there is “a lesser expectation of privacy in a car than
      there is in one’s home or office, or with respect to their physical person”:
      see <i>Caslake</i> at para.&nbsp;34.  The respondent had been lawfully
      searched and a handgun (later determined to be a pellet gun) had been seized.  A
      passenger in the car had been arrested and a large knife and a handgun
      (also later determined to be a pellet gun) were seized from him.  More
      police arrived on the scene.  When Constable&nbsp;Chant and his partner
      searched the interior of the car – a lawful search – two more large knives
      and an Exacto knife were discovered.  In these circumstances – four arrests,
      lawful searches of four persons and the interior of a car, and discovery
      and seizure of what appeared to be two handguns and four knives – it is
      difficult to see any <br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>

      same circumstances also, in my view, provide a strong and supportable reason
      for the search of the car trunk.  In his testimony on the <i>voir dire</i>,
      Constable&nbsp;Chant was candid about his reasons for searching the car
      trunk:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE COURT:      You’re looking for more evidence
    of what?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE WITNESS: Well, I knew – for weapons, Your Honour.
    Because I knew that there had been two firearms located already, a knife,
    and that’s significant in my mind as far as offences, criminal offences,
    and so I began searching the car to see if there was any other weapons in
    the car.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Later in his testimony,
      Constable&nbsp;Chant described his search of the car trunk, in the context

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When
      Constable&nbsp;Chant arrived on the scene – a dark parking lot in the early
      morning hours of a wintry night – he faced “a very volatile situation in
      which it is fair for the police to expect the unexpected”: see <i>R. v.
      Lim (No.&nbsp;2)</i> (1990), 1 C.R.R. (2d) 136 at 142 (H.C.J.), Doherty</span>&nbsp;J.  Constable&nbsp;Chant
      and his partner were responding to an emergency call for police back&#8209;up.  As
      soon as Constable&nbsp;Chant arrived, he was informed that two men had
      been arrested and two handguns had been seized.  Constable&nbsp;Chant approached
      the vehicle and saw two other men seated in the back of the car.  When
      he opened a rear door, he saw one of the men trying to kick a large knife
      under the seat.  He removed him from the car, brought him to the ground
      and handcuffed him.  Meanwhile, his partner was dealing with the other
      man in the back seat.  He discovered another large knife and an Exacto
      knife.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    purpose of s.&nbsp;8 of the <i>Charter</i> is to protect against unreasonable
    searches.  In the circumstances I have outlined, Constable&nbsp;Chant’s search
    of the car trunk for more weapons strikes me as the antithesis of an unreasonable
    search.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Cloutier</i> at
    p.&nbsp;278, the court observed that a search incident to arrest “must be
    for a valid objective in pursuit of the ends of criminal justice, such as
    the discovery of an object that may be a threat to the safety of the police,
    the accused or the public”.  In my view, this is precisely the situation
    in the present case.  Where multiple weapons have been discovered on several
    arrested persons and in their vehicle, and where the arrests and searches
    leading to the discovery of the weapons are lawful, finishing the search
    of the same vehicle with a view to finding more weapons is the epitome of
    reasonable police conduct.  This can be contrasted with <i>Belnavis</i> where
    the search, conducted with a view to discovering stolen property, was unrelated
    to the arrest for traffic fines.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    the discovery of additional weapons would, potentially, be connected to a
    fair assessment of the nature and gravity of the weapons&#8209;related charges
    that the four men in the car were already facing.  It might shed light on
    the intended use to be made of the weapons already located on two of the
    accused and in the interior of the car.  In this respect, the search complied
    with Lamer&nbsp;C.J.C.’s stricture in <i>Caslake</i> at para.&nbsp;17 that “the
    search is only justifiable if the purpose of the search is related to the
    purpose of the arrest.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is true that the discovery of additional weapons in this case led to other
    weapons&#8209;related charges.  However, this result was foreshadowed in <i>Caslake</i> (para.
    26) and actually occurred in <i>Polashek</i>.  Additional charges flowing
    from a valid search are an appropriate result of the search.</p>

lang=EN-US>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    summary, I conclude that in the circumstances of this case, where multiple
    suspects have been lawfully arrested and several weapons have been discovered
    pursuant to lawful searches of the arrested persons and the interior of a
    car, it is appropriate for a police officer to search the trunk of the same
    car with a view to discovering additional weapons.  These weapons can be
    relevant to the weapons charges that have already been laid; they can also
    ground additional weapons&#8209;related charges.</p>

      explicitly to trial fairness because the respondent conceded this factor
      at his trial, what is completely missing from the trial judge’s reasons
      is any indication of how he balanced the <i>Collins</i> factors.  Such
      an assessment is particularly important in a case, like this one, where

      fairness – admit; seriousness of the <i>Charter</i> breach – exclude).</span></p>

'><span lang=EN-US>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
      the trial judge erred in concluding that there was “nothing in the evidence
      which persuades me that there was any mitigating factor which might explain
      or lessen the seriousness of the <i>Charter</i> violations.”  Similar to <i>Caslake</i>,
      the search of the respondent’s car was unobtrusive.  There is no evidence
      that the car was damaged.  Moreover, the search of a car does not attract
      the same protection as the search of a person’s body, home or office:  <i>Caslake</i> at
      para.&nbsp;34.  In addition, any expectation of privacy in the contents
      of the car trunk recedes to the extreme periphery, in my view, in a situation
      where several persons have been lawfully arrested and multiple weapons
      have been discovered through lawful searches of the arrested persons and
      the interior of the car.  Finally, the fact of a loaded sawed&#8209;off
      shotgun in a car is a very serious matter.  There is no good or benign
      purpose for such a weapon.  Society must be protected from criminals armed
      with deadly weapons: see <i>R. v. D.&nbsp;(Q.)</i> (2005), 199 C.C.C. (3d)
      490 at paras. 77&#8209;78 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  In light of these factors, if the search conducted by Constable&nbsp;Chant
    was unreasonable (which, I have determined, it was not), Constable&nbsp;Chant’s <i>Charter</i> breach
    was not a serious one.</span></p>

      the <i>Charter</i> was not a serious one, it follows that the administration
      of justice would not be brought into disrepute by its admission.</span></p>
