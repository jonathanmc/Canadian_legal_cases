  <p class=MsoHeader><b>On appeal from the judgment of the Divisional Court (Aston,
      Valin and Pierce JJ.) dated November 15, 2005.</b></p>
  <p class=MsoHeader><b>FELDMAN J.A.:</b></p>
  <h3><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Overview</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellants were part of a group of plaintiffs in a proposed class action.
    The class action was certified but the appellants were excluded from the
    class. They are appealing that decision to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court. The issue before this court is whether they are entitled
    to appeal directly to the Divisional Court under s. 30(1) of the <i>Class
    Proceedings Act, 1992</i>, S.O. 1992, c. 6, because it is an appeal “from
    an order refusing to certify a proceeding as a class proceeding”, or whether
    they may only appeal with leave under s. 30(2), because it is “an order certifying
    a proceeding as a class proceeding”.</p>
  <h3><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Procedural Background</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellants were all named plaintiffs in the action that is the subject of
    the class proceeding. The action arose as a result of a fire at a manufacturing
    facility in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Kingsville,
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario. The fire sent a plume of smoke sailing out from the plant and caused
    the evacuation of about 3200 people. The proposed class included people within
    an area 100 times the size of the evacuated area. On the motion for certification
    of the action, Patterson J. certified the class action, but limited the class
    to “those individuals who were evacuated from the evacuated area….”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    plaintiffs who were excluded from the class appealed the decision to the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court under s. 30(1) of the <i>Class Proceedings Act</i>. The
    respondent moved to quash the appeal on the basis that the appellants required
    leave to appeal under s. 30(2) of the Act.  Subsections 30(1) and (2) provide:</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>30. (1) A party may appeal to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court from an order refusing to certify a proceeding as a class
    proceeding and from an order decertifying a proceeding.</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>(2) A party may appeal to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court from an order certifying a proceeding as a class proceeding
    with leave of the Ontario Superior Court as provided in the rules of court. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      On
    June 21, 2005 Rady J., sitting as a single judge of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court, dismissed the respondent’s motion to quash. She found that
    the certification order was, in effect, a dismissal of the certification
    motion of those plaintiffs who were excluded from the class, and that that
    dismissal finally determined their rights for the purpose of this class proceeding.
    As the order was therefore a final order for the appellants, they were entitled
    to appeal as of right.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    respondent appealed the order of Rady J. to a full panel of the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court. The
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court allowed the appeal, holding that because Patterson J.’s
    order was an order that certified a class proceeding, an appeal from that
    order lies only with leave under s. 30(2). The court stated that the words
    of s. 30 are clear and that the question whether the order of Patterson J.
    was final or interlocutory is not a relevant inquiry. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellants obtained leave from this court to appeal the decision of the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court.</p>
  <h3><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Analysis</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellants recognize that they must fit within the requirements of s. 30(1)
    of the <i>Class Proceedings Act</i> in order to be able to appeal as of right
    to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court. They therefore characterize the order being appealed as
    an order that refuses certification to the appellants. In my view, this characterization
    is flawed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    order of Patterson J. granted certification of the action. It also dealt
    with the issues mandated by s. 8(1) of the Act: the description of the class;
    the names of the representative parties; the nature of the claims asserted
    by the class; the relief sought by the class; the common issues; and the
    manner and date for opting out. In the description of the class, the motion
    judge determined that the geographical area describing the residential criteria
    that defined the class was too large. His solution was to redefine the area
    by limiting it to the section from which residents were evacuated as a result
    of the fire. The effect was to remove the appellants from the class that
    was certified. That did not, however, make the order one that refuses certification. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    definition of the members of the class is one of the terms of a certification
    order. Under s. 8(3), a certification order can be amended. One of the possible
    amendments is to change the description of the class. However, the order
    remains a certification order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under
    s. 10(1), in certain circumstances a court may either amend the certification
    order, it may decertify “the proceeding”, or it may make any other order
    it considers appropriate. Unlike amendment, decertification means there no
    longer is a class proceeding. In that case, under s. 10(2), “the court may
    permit the proceeding to continue as one or more proceedings between different
    parties.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that in interpreting s. 30, the court should have regard
    to the final/interlocutory distinction and, where the effect of an order
    is to finally determine the rights of a party, that effect should govern
    the determination of the appeal route. They say that in this case, the effect
    of the order of Patterson J. is twofold: while it certifies the class proceeding,
    it also refuses certification to part of the proposed class and therefore
    gives those people the right to appeal under s. 30(1). The appellants conclude
    that the effect of the order is that “it finally determines the substantial
    issue between them and the defendants and terminates their right to pursue
    a class proceeding.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    reject this submission for two reasons. The first is that s. 30 defines the
    rights to appeal both directly and with leave in a specific manner that does
    not rely on the final/interlocutory distinction. As a matter of pure statutory
    interpretation, one may conclude that the legislature’s decision was a deliberate
    one. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Bolstering
    that conclusion is the 1982 Ontario Law Reform Commission<i> Report</i> <i>on
    Class Actions</i>,<i> </i>which recommended that the appeal provision be
    explicitly spelled out and not rely on the final/interlocutory distinction.
    The Law Reform Commission based its recommendation on a review of the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      U.S.</st1:country-region>
    class action jurisprudence on appeals, where the use of the final/interlocutory
    distinction had resulted in a severe curtailment of the right to appeal orders
    granting and denying certification (Vol. 3 (Toronto: Ministry of the Attorney
    General, 1982) at 818, 821-22).<i> </i>Although when it fashioned the Act,
    the legislature did not adopt the explicit wording of the appeal rights recommended
    by the Law Reform Commission, it did specifically define those rights in
    s. 30 without reference to the final/interlocutory distinction.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second reason why I do not accept the appellants’
    submission is that the right of the appellants to pursue their action against
    the defendants was not finally determined by the certification order, nor
    did it terminate their right to pursue a class proceeding. In his reasons,
    the motion judge addressed, as he was required to do, the issue of preferable
    procedure. In that context, he noted that the class action with the evacuated
    group as the class would determine the issue of the liability of the defendants
    for the fire as a test case;  the excluded claimants could then pursue their
    claims for damages on an individual basis. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the test case in the class action were to determine that the defendants are
    liable for the fire, the doctrine of abuse of process would likely prevent
    the defendants, who would have had a full and fair opportunity to defend
    the original claim, from re-litigating that issue.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Toronto</i><i> (City) v. Canadian
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union of Public Employees (C.U.P.E.), Local 79</i>, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 77 at

    Bar Rev. 623. There would be no policy reason to preclude the appellants
    from relying on the judgment in the first action: they are manifestly not “wait
    and see” plaintiffs; the defendants have every incentive to defend vigorously
    the action brought by the class that has been certified; and, as the two
    actions would be tried in the same forum, the same procedural safeguards
    and opportunities would be available to the defendants in both. See<i> Toronto
    v. CUPE</i>, <i>supra</i> at para. 53;<i> Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore</i>,

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
    322 (1979). At the very least, if the test case assigned liability to the
    defendants, although the result  would not be binding as between the plaintiffs
    who were excluded from the class (the appellants) and the defendants, it
    would form a strong basis for the parties to treat the issue of liability
    as settled, rather than to re-litigate it. Those plaintiffs could then pursue
    their action for damages. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    I can see no reason why the appellants, or an appropriate subgroup of them,
    would be precluded from seeking certification and, if certification were
    granted, commencing a new class action as a separate class.<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></a></span> What has been determined to date is that it was
    not appropriate for them to be part of the class in the within action. Whether
    they can make a case as a separate class has not been determined, should
    they wish to pursue the issue.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither
    party directed the court to any case that addressed the issue of the proper
    appeal route that is raised on this appeal. In most other provinces, the
    appeals from both an order certifying and from an order refusing to certify
    a proceeding as a class proceeding are either both by leave or both as of
    right. In British Columbia and Alberta, any party may appeal as of right
    either from an order certifying or an order refusing to certify a proceeding
    as a class proceeding, while in Alberta, Manitoba and Newfoundland and Labrador,
    any party wishing to appeal either an order certifying or refusing to certify
    must first obtain leave.<a

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    a brief endorsement in <i>Billette c. Groupe Dumoulin Electronique inc</i>.,
    [2003] J.Q. No 23162, the Court of Appeal for
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Quebec said that a member of the plaintiff group who had been excluded from
    the class had the right to appeal that decision with leave, treating the
    decision as one that denied certification to the excluded plaintiffs. I would
    not apply the result in that case to an appeal under the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario provisions for two reasons. The first is that the judgment is brief
    and does not provide any discussion or analysis of the consequences of interpreting
    the right to appeal from an order denying certification to include an order
    that limits the class that is certified in the context of the provisions
    of the Quebec Act. The second is that in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Quebec, unlike in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario, there is no appeal at all from a decision granting certification.
    The fact that there is absolutely no appeal, either by right or by leave,
    from a decision that grants certification may have influenced the court’s
    interpretation of the effect of a decision that excludes some prospective
    plaintiffs from the certified class.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    can see neither a rule of statutory interpretation nor any policy argument
    that derogates from the conclusion that the words of ss. 30(1) and (2) of
    the <i>Class Proceedings Act</i> are clear and logical. Where an order for
    certification has been made, the action should be able to continue without
    waiting for an appeal process that may unduly delay the proceeding. Delaying
    the progress of a class action would be justified only if leave were to be
    granted, because then there would be an issue of particular importance to
    be determined. On the other hand, if certification is refused, then there
    is no class action and an appeal in that circumstance is required. To interpret
    the exclusion of people from the certified class as a refusal to certify
    the action effectively stops the action while the excluded plaintiffs appeal
    as of right. In my view, such a result would not advance the purpose of the
    Act, which seeks to facilitate access to justice and the principles of effective
    and timely use of the judicial process.<i></i></p>
