  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    moving party, Shehrazad Non&#8209;Profit Housing Inc. (the “Corporation”),
    seeks a stay pending appeal of the order of Spence&nbsp;J. dated January
    20, 2007 appointing a receiver.  The respondent, the Ministry of Municipal
    Affairs and Housing (the “Ministry”), opposes the motion on two bases: (1)
    the Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction to hear the motion because the order
    being appealed is an interlocutory order and, therefore, an appeal must be
    taken, to the Divisional Court; and (2) on the merits, the moving party cannot
    meet the test for obtaining a stay.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>B.        </span>FACTS</h4>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>            (1)       The

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Corporation was established in 1985 to provide social housing services in
    the City of Kitchener.  The Corporation operates two social housing projects,
    known as Shehrazad I and Shehrazad II.  Each project is governed by a contract
    between the Corporation and the Ministry.  The Corporation depends on funding
    from the Ministry.  Funding for the construction of the projects was provided
    through mortgages insured by the Canada Mortgage Housing Corporation (“CMHC”).  The
    Ministry is ultimately liable for the mortgage payments in the event the
    Corporation defaults.  The Corporation also received subsidies from the Ministry.  Each
    project is governed by a different subsidy scheme, but generally speaking,
    the subsidies are designed to compensate for the difference between the Corporation’s
    operating costs and revenues.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Corporation is run by a Board of Directors made up of volunteers, many of
    whom have been involved since its inception.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Several
    years ago, problems between the Board and the Ministry arose concerning the
    finances of the Corporation.  On July 21, 2003, the Ministry sent a letter
    to the Board raising a number of concerns.  The Ministry and the Corporation
    were in the process of establishing a plan for retrofitting the housing projects.  The
    Ministry requested a list of firms that the Corporation wanted to include
    in the tender process.  The Ministry also pointed to a number of financial
    concerns.  It alleged that the Corporation had accumulated a deficit, unfunded
    replacement reserves, mortgage arrears, outstanding loans, excess costs,
    significant vacancies and outstanding financial statements.  In the letter,
    the Ministry demanded immediate action on the part of the Corporation and
    stated that it would “exercise the remedies available” if necessary.  The
    Corporation responded by letter on September 10, 2003.  The Ministry was
    not satisfied with the Corporation’s response and suspended subsidy payments
    in September 2003.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Ministry alleges that the Corporation failed to make mortgage payments on
    Shehrazad I from 2002 to 2006 and on Shehrazad II from 2003 to the present.  The
    Ministry has been indemnifying CMHC for these mortgage payments.  Between
    2005 and 2006, the projects underwent a $1.7 million retrofit, funded by
    the Ministry.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Corporation states that, with the exception of the mortgage payments, all
    of its financial obligations are up to date.  It further notes that it re-started
    mortgage payments on Shehrazad I in 2006.</p>

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto (on the Commercial List) for the appointment of a receiver and manager
    on February 27, 2006.  In its Notice of Application, the Ministry states
    that the appointment of a receiver is necessary in order to prepare for the
    sale of the projects to another non-profit corporation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    application for the appointment of a receiver was heard on January 20, 2007.  The
    application judge refused the Corporation’s motions for a stay of the receivership
    application, a consolidation of the proceedings and a change of venue to
    Kitchener.  The application judge ordered the appointment of a receiver and
    manager.  He held that the Corporation was insolvent, the receiver was qualified
    and there was “a risk to the assets and the operation of the project”.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Ministry submits that the Corporation has brought its appeal in the wrong
    court and that the appeal should be to the
    <st1:Street

    Divisional Court with leave.  It follows that the motion for a stay of the
    application judge’s order should also be to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    Divisional Court and this court does not have jurisdiction to issue a stay
    of the order.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Ministry commenced its application, including the relief to appoint a receiver
    and manager, pursuant to s.&nbsp;101(1) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;C.43, which provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>101(1) In the Superior Court of Justice, an interlocutory
    injunction or mandatory order may be granted or a receiver or receiver and
    manager may be appointed by an interlocutory order, where it appears to a
    judge of the court to be just or convenient to do so.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>The Ministry submits that the application
    judge’s order pursuant to this provision was, by definition, interlocutory.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    disagree.  The Ministry did not bring a motion to appoint a receiver; rather,
    it made an application.  The judge specifically referred to it as an application
    in his endorsement.  The draft order prepared by the Ministry refers to an
    application.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    follows that the decision of this court in <i>Illidge (Trustee of) v. St.
    James Securities Inc.</i> (2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 155, governs the question
    of which court has jurisdiction to hear the appeal in these proceedings.  In <i>Illidge</i>,
    the appellant sought an order setting aside the appointment of the respondent
    as receiver on the basis of an alleged conflict of interest by reason of
    the respondent’s role as trustee in the bankruptcy for other parties.  The
    respondent argued that the Court of Appeal lacked jurisdiction to hear the
    appeal because the order appointing the receiver was interlocutory and not
    final.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    court rejected this argument.  Armstrong&nbsp;J.A. stated at para.&nbsp;4:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>At the initial proceeding, Soberman sought the appointment
    as receiver by way of application rather than on interlocutory motion.  As
    stated by this court in <i>Hendrickson v. Kallio</i>, [1932] O.R. 675, …
    and in numerous subsequent cases, orders that finally determine the issues
    raised in an application are final orders.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>In my view, this passage is directly
    applicable to, and disposes of, the Ministry’s objection that the Corporation
    has brought its appeal to the wrong court.  It follows that the Corporation’s
    motion for a stay should be considered on the merits.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>            (2)       </span>The

    O.J. No. 929 at para. 14 (C.A.), </span>Weiler<span lang=EN> J.A. reaffirmed
    that the test from <i>RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General)</i>,
    [1994] 1 S.C.R. 311,<i> </i>test is to be used on a motion for a stay pending
    appeal: </span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN>The test for staying an order pending
      an <a name="ORIGHIT_16"></a><a name="HIT_16"></a>appeal is the same as
      the test for an interlocutory injunction: <i>Circuit World Corp. v. Lesperance

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at 676-677.  First, a preliminary assessment must be made of the merits
    of the case to ensure that there is a serious question to be determined on
    the <a name="ORIGHIT_17"></a><a
name="HIT_17"></a>appeal<b>.</b>  Second, the court must determine if the appellant
    would suffer irreparable harm if the application were refused.  Finally,
    the balance of convenience must be determined by assessing which of the parties
    would suffer greater harm from the granting or refusal of the remedy pending
    a decision on the merits.</span></p>
  <h4><i><span style='text-decoration:none;

      World</i>, Laskin J.A. held that this first part of the test constitutes
      a low threshold.  At p. 677, he wrote that the court
    “should not extensively review the merits of the appeal,” but it must determine
    that the issues raised are not frivolous or vexatious.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, the Corporation submits that the following serious issues must
    be determined:</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Whether

  <p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Whether

  <p style='text-align:justify;'><span

  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Whether
    or not the subsidies terminated by the Ministry were justifiably terminated
    and whether or not an abuse of process occurred.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>In essence, the Corporation argues
    that a receiver should not have been appointed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Ministry argues that there are no serious issues concerning the application
    judge’s appointment of a receiver.  It states that the application judge
    properly considered the relationship between the parties, whether the Ministry’s
    security was at risk, and the prejudice to the parties.  The Ministry further
    submits that the outcome of the subsidy action is irrelevant to the receivership
    application – even if the Corporation were successful, it would still owe
    the Ministry over $1 million and have an operating deficit.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the Corporation raises questions that are not merely frivolous or
    vexatious.  First, the financial state of the Corporation is a contested
    issue.  The Ministry argues (and the application judge held) that the Corporation
    is insolvent.  Conversely, the Corporation argues that it is up to date on
    its financial commitments, except for the money owing on the mortgages.  The
    Corporation further argues that it would not owe this money but for the Ministry’s
    cessation of the subsidy payments.  Therefore, issues for determination on
    appeal include whether the Corporation was in fact insolvent and whether
    the action for damages is relevant to that question.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    while this was not raised by either party, it appears to me that there may
    be a procedural issue to be determined on appeal, namely, whether it was
    appropriate for the Ministry to commence an application for the appointment
    of a receiver without that application being ancillary to another proceeding
    for relief.  According to r. 14.05(3)(g) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>,
    R.R.O. 1990, Reg.&nbsp;194, an application for the appointment of a receiver
    can be brought “when ancillary to relief claimed in a proceeding properly
    commenced by a notice of application.”  Similarly, r. 41.02 contemplates
    that a motion for the appointment of a receiver can be brought “in a pending
    or intended proceeding.”  In this case, the Ministry commenced its application
    for the appointment of a receiver without seeking any other relief.  In fact,
    it was not until the Corporation commenced an action for damages that the
    Ministry counterclaimed seeking the repayment of its debts.  This suggests
    that the Ministry’s sole purpose in appointing a receiver was to transfer
    the operation of the projects to another non-profit corporation.  While the
    Corporation has not raised this procedural issue, it does argue that the
    purpose behind the application was for the Ministry “to ‘wash its hands’ of
    this social housing project and transfer administrative responsibility over
    the project to the Region of Waterloo.”  Arguably, there is an issue as to
    whether it was appropriate to appoint a receiver in these circumstances where
    the Ministry did not appear to be concerned about having its debts repaid,
    but was concerned only with transferring the business to another corporation.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    balance, given the low threshold for this stage of the test, I conclude that
    there are serious issues to be determined on appeal that are not frivolous
    or vexatious.</p>
  <h4><i><span style='text-decoration:none;

        is refused?</span></i></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Corporation raises a number of arguments that point to the irreparable harm
    it would suffer if a stay is not granted.  In my view, the strongest argument
    is that the Corporation faces the risk that the projects could be transferred
    to another non-profit corporation by the receiver.  As set out in the affidavit
    of Edna Coupal,
    “the harm against Shehrazad would be irreparable, as it would lose its primary
    assets (<i>i.e.</i> the housing projects), all its sources of income (<i>i.e.</i> rents),
    and its reason for being (<i>i.e. </i>to manage non-profit housing in Kitchener
    at the premises).”  In <i>RJR-MacDonald</i>, irreparable harm was described
    as “harm which either cannot be quantified in monetary terms or which cannot
    be cured” (p. 341).  In this case, the harm suffered by the Corporation should
    the projects be transferred by the receiver would not be compensable or curable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Ministry notes in its factum that evidence of irreparable harm “must be clear
    and not speculative”: <i>Kanda Tsushin Kogyo
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Co. v. Coveley</i> (1997), 96 O.A.C. 324 at para.&nbsp;14 (
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Div. Ct.).  While the harm discussed above was expressed in terms of a “risk”,
    this risk seems more than speculative given that the receiver’s mandate is
    to transfer the business to a new entity.</p>
  <h4><i><span style='text-decoration:none;
text-underline:none'>Does the balance of convenience favour the granting of a
        stay?</span></i></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    stage of the analysis requires balancing the harm that would be suffered
    by each party.  I have concluded that the Corporation risks suffering irreparable
    harm should the stay be refused.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    harm to the Ministry must also be considered.  Essentially, the harm that
    the Ministry will suffer if the stay is granted is continued financial losses.  This
    is purely financial and therefore is technically compensable.  However, the
    ability of the debtor to pay is a relevant consideration and the Ministry
    argues that the Corporation is insolvent: <i>RJR-MacDonald</i>, p. 341.  The
    Ministry states that it has already incurred substantial losses.  However,
    the effect of a stay would only be to aggravate these losses temporarily
    until the appeal is heard (probably a matter of months).  When this is compared
    to the harm that the Corporation risks suffering if the stay is refused,
    this factor favours granting the stay.</p>
