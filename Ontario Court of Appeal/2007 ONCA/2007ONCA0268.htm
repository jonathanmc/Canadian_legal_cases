    to the orders of Farley&nbsp;J. of April 20, 2005 and May 18, 2005, RSM Richter
    Inc. (&quot;Richter&quot;) was appointed receiver and manager and interim
    receiver of the property, assets and undertaking of what is referred to in
    these proceedings as the Ravelston Companies, including the Ravelston Corporation
    Limited (&quot;RCL&quot;), Ravelston Management Inc. (&quot;RMI&quot;) and
    Argus Corporation Limited (&quot;Argus&quot;).  On April&nbsp;20, 2005 the
    court also issued an order granting RCL and RMI protection under the <span
class=Italics>Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act</span>, R.S.C. 1985, c.&nbsp;C-36
    (“CCAA”) and appointing Richter as the monitor.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Initially,
    Farley&nbsp;J. was the supervisory judge in this complex and long&#8209;term
    insolvency.  The current supervisory judge is Cumming&nbsp;J.  From the outset
    of its appointment as receiver, Richter has regularly filed reports with
    the court detailing the steps that it has taken in fulfilling its mandate,
    asking that the court approve each report and the recommendations contained
    in it and, frequently, asking the court's approval to take a particular step
    or to follow a particular course of action.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion before Cumming&nbsp;J., giving rise to this motion for leave to appeal,
    emanated from Richter's Nineteenth Report recommending the preparation of
    a report (the &quot;Payments Report&quot;) setting out a factual account
    of the monies received by, and the distributions made by, RCL, RMI and Angus
    during the respective periods January 3, 1997 to April 20, 2005, July 3,
    2002 to April 20, 2005, and January 1, 1999 to April 30, 2005.  Pursuant
    to Richter's motion for authorization to complete and file the Payments Report
    with the Superior Court of Justice, on January&nbsp;12,&nbsp;2007 Cumming&nbsp;J.
    ordered Richter to complete the Payments Report, provided that it would not
    be filed or disseminated to any party until further order of the Superior
    Court.  Pursuant to a further motion brought by Richter, on February&nbsp;15,&nbsp;2007,
    Cumming&nbsp;J. ordered Richter to file the Payments Report with the Superior
    Court.  The Payments Report contains data as to payments made by RCL, RMI
    and Argus to corporate officers of these companies, including Conrad Black,
    who is a defendant in ongoing criminal proceedings in the United States District
    Court in Chicago.  Before Cumming&nbsp;J., only Lord&nbsp;Black opposed the
    filing of the Payments Report.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Lord&nbsp;Black
    subsequently moved under s.&nbsp;193(e) of the <span class=Italics>Bankruptcy
    and Insolvency Act</span>, R.S.C. 1985, c.&nbsp;B-3 (&quot;BIA&quot;) for
    leave to appeal Cumming&nbsp;J.'s order of February&nbsp;15,&nbsp;2007 to
    the Court of Appeal.  On March 22, 2007 I dismissed Black's motion with reasons
    to follow.  These are my reasons.</p>
  <h1><span style='font-weight:normal;'>II</span></h1>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    its Nineteenth Report, Richter indicated that on December 14, 2006 the United
    States Attorney's Office (&quot;USAO&quot;) asked it to prepare and provide
    a schedule of payments, including salaries, bonuses and dividends, made by
    the Ravelston Companies to Lord&nbsp;Black and others between January,&nbsp;1998
    and January,&nbsp;2004.  The USAO is a stakeholder in the Ravelston estate,
    as is Lord&nbsp;Black.  A number of other stakeholders have also requested
    similar information from Richter.  Before Cumming&nbsp;J., and before this
    court, Lord&nbsp;Black contended that because on its filing the Payments
    Report would become a public document and available to all stakeholders,
    including the USAO, the information contained in the Report may assist the
    prosecution in the ongoing criminal proceedings.  He contended that there
    may be unfairness in the use of the information revealed by the Payments
    Report.  Lord&nbsp;Black, therefore, submitted that the Report should not
    be filed until the conclusion of the criminal proceedings against him.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his reasons, reported at [2007] O.J. No. 536 (S.C.J.), Cumming&nbsp;J. pointed
    out at para.&nbsp;26 that in the normal course of events the Payments Report
    would be filed with the court by the receiver when it is completed, to be
    used by the receiver in administering the estate, and to be used by all stakeholders
    in assessing their positions and in making representations to the receiver.  At
    para.&nbsp;27, Cumming&nbsp;J. stated that Lord&nbsp;Black had not provided
    any evidence that the filing of the Payments Report would be to his prejudice
    as a financial stakeholder having an economic interest in the Ravelston&nbsp;estate.  To
    this I would add that Lord&nbsp;Black has also failed to provide any evidence
    that the filing of the Payments Report would prejudice the fairness of his
    criminal trial.  As Cumming&nbsp;J. correctly observed, the possible use
    by the prosecution of any information contained in the Report as evidence
    against Black is a consideration for the United States District Court in
    Chicago. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    rejecting Black's attempt to seal the Report, at para.&nbsp;33 Cumming&nbsp;J.
    stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is the personal interest of Lord Black at stake
    in the criminal proceedings which results in his request to delay the release
    of the Payments Report.  The Receiver submits that such a personal interest,
    as opposed to an economic interest, is beyond the Receiver's area of proper
    consideration in the administration of the estate.  The Receiver is not obliged
    to protect the interests of stakeholders which are unrelated to the administration
    of a debtor's estate, such as the interest of a stakeholder to avoid alleged
    prejudice in criminal proceedings. The Receiver's role is to make business
    decisions in the best interests of the estate after a careful cost/benefit
    analysis and the weighing of competing interests. <span class=Italics>Ravelston

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the opinion of Cumming&nbsp;J., the receiver's decision to provide the Payments
    Report and to file it with the court as relevant information for the benefit
    of the stakeholders was &quot;within the bounds of reasonableness&quot;.  At
    para.&nbsp;47, he added:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[A]n Order sealing the Payment Report until the
    close of Lord Black's criminal trial would be inappropriate.  There is not
    any social value established on evidence by Lord Black which is of superordinate
    importance to the rights of the public to open access to court records and
    the interest of the estate's stakeholders to proceed unimpeded with the receivership.  There
    is a strong presumption against any order that restricts public access to
    court proceedings or records that must be met by an applicant before a sealing
    order may properly issue.  <span class=Italics>R. v. Toronto Star Newspapers

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his motion for leave to appeal, Lord&nbsp;Black submits that Cumming&nbsp;J.
    committed two errors: (1) he erred in his duty to supervise the receiver
    to ensure that it met its fiduciary duty to all stakeholders to act in an
    even&#8209;handed manner; and (2) he erred in his understanding of the principle
    of comity and failed to consider the prejudice to Lord&nbsp;Black, a Canadian
    resident, arising from the use of the Payments Report in the American criminal
    proceedings against Lord&nbsp;Black.</p>

    contends that his proposed appeal raises issues significant to bankruptcy
    practice for which there is no guidance, including the extent and nature
    of the court’s role in supervising the work of a court&#8209;appointed receiver
    whose interests, which are adverse to a major stakeholder, conflict with
    his duties to act in an even&#8209;handed manner, and the appropriate conduct
    of the receiver where it has consequences to stakeholders beyond the Canadian
    border.  Lord&nbsp;Black also contends that granting leave to appeal will
    not hinder the administration of the receivership as the receiver conceded
    in submissions before Cumming&nbsp;J. that there is no need to file the Payments
    Report now for any reason relating to the administration of the receivership.</p>

    Armstrong&nbsp;J.A. noted, at para.&nbsp;15 of <i>SVCM Capital Ltd. v. Fiber
    Connections Inc.</i> (2005), 10 C.B.R. (5th) 201 (Ont. C.A.) there appears
    to be a “measure of confusion” in respect to the test for leave to appeal
    under s.&nbsp;193(e) of the BIA.  However, the caselaw is clear that one
    factor that is considered in all cases is whether the appeal is <i>prima
    facie</i> meritorious, a factor that Armstrong&nbsp;J.A. relied on in <i>SVCM</i>.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>R.J.
    Nicol Construction Ltd. (Trustee of) v. Nicol</i> (1995), 30 C.B.R. (3d)
    90 (Ont. C.A.); <i>Re Baker</i> (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 376 (C.A.); <i>GMAC
    Commercial Credit Corp. of Canada v. TCT Logistics Inc.</i>, [2003] O.J.
    No. 5761 (C.A.); <i>Ravelston Corp. (Re)</i> (2005), 24 C.B.R. (5th) 256
    (Ont. C.A.).  Similarly, this factor is also considered by the court in applications
    seeking leave to appeal under s.&nbsp;193(e) from orders made under the CCAA: <i>Stelco
    Inc. (Re)</i> (2005), 78 O.R. (3d) 254 (C.A.).<i> </i></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>Ravelston</i>,
    supra, is a helpful example of the need for a <i>prima facie</i> meritorious
    appeal as the starting point in the application of the test under s.&nbsp;193(e).  If
    the proposed appeal is found to be <i>prima facie</i> meritorious, the court
    must then consider whether the other elements of the test have been met.  At
    paras.&nbsp;27&#8209;32 of <i>Ravelston</i>, Doherty&nbsp;J.A. provided this
    helpful guidance:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As indicated above, s. 193(e) permits leave to
    appeal from any order on any issue that the court determines warrants leave
    to appeal.  There are no statutory criteria governing the granting of leave.
    Appellate courts, using different formulations, have identified various factors
    that should be addressed when deciding whether to grant leave under s. 193(e)
    of the BIA.  The cases recognize, however, that the granting of leave to
    appeal is an exercise in judicial discretion that must be case-specific,
    and cannot be completely captured in any single formulation of the relevant
    criteria:  [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The inquiry into whether leave to appeal should
    be granted must, however, begin with some consideration of the merits of
    the proposed appeal.  If the appeal cannot possibly succeed, there is no
    point in granting leave to appeal regardless of how many other factors might
    support the granting of leave to appeal.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A leave to appeal application is not the time to
    assess, much less decide, the ultimate merits of a proposed appeal.  However,
    the applicant must be able to convince the court that there are legitimately
    arguable points raised so as to create a realistic possibility of success
    on the appeal.  Granting leave to appeal if the merits fall short of even
    that relatively low bar would be a waste of court resources and would needlessly
    delay and complicate insolvency proceedings.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In <i>Re Canadian Airlines Corp.</i> (2000), 261
    A.R. 120 at para. 35 (C.A.), Wittmann J.A. (in chambers) was faced with an
    application for leave under the CCAA.  He referred to earlier cases which
    had listed four criteria for the granting of leave, one of which was that “the
    appeal is prima facie meritorious.”  He described the necessary merits inquiry
    in this way:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>… There must appear to be an error in principle
    of law or a palpable and overriding error of fact.  Exercise of discretion
    by a supervising judge, so long as it is exercised judicially, is not a matter
    for interference by an appellate court, even if the appellate court were
    inclined to decide the matter another way.  It is precisely this kind of
    a factor which breathes life into the modifier “prima facie”
    meritorious.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I think the same level of merits inquiry is warranted
    on an application for leave to appeal under the BIA.  I would describe an
    appeal which raises an apparent error in law or apparent palpable and overriding
    factual error as an appeal that has a realistic possibility of success.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The court need address the other matters relevant
    to the exercise of its discretion on a leave to appeal application only if
    the applicant demonstrates that the appeal has prima facie merit.  I do not
    reach those other considerations on this motion.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    I have indicated, Lord&nbsp;Black’s proposed appeal focuses on two aspects
    of the reasons of Cumming J.  He submitted that Cumming J. failed to act
    fairly and even&#8209;handedly in preferring the interests of the other stakeholder,
    USAO to his interests, thereby possibly prejudicing his right to a fair trial
    in the American criminal proceedings.  Second, he contends that Cumming&nbsp;J.
    erred in his understanding of the principles of comity.  In my view, neither
    of the proposed grounds of appeal is <i>prima facie</i> meritorious.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    are two important principles that this court has endorsed in considering
    whether leave to appeal should be granted in bankruptcy and CCAA proceedings.  In <i>Ravelston
    Corp. (Re)</i>, [2007] O.J. No. 749 at para. 3 (C.A.), the court stated: “It
    is well established that an appellate court owes substantial deference to
    the discretion of a commercial court judge charged with the responsibility
    of supervising insolvency and restructuring proceedings and that absent demonstrable
    error, it will not interfere.”  In <i>Ravelston Corp. (Re)</i> (2005), 24
    C.B.R. (5th) 256 at para.&nbsp;40 (Ont. C.A.), Doherty&nbsp;J.A. stated: “If
    the receiver’s decision is within the broad bounds of reasonableness, and
    if it proceeds fairly, having considered the interests of all the stakeholders,
    the court will support the receiver’s decision.”  These principles, necessarily,
    inform the determination of whether the proposed appeal is <i>prima facie</i> meritorious.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Turning
    to the first proposed ground of appeal, as Cumming&nbsp;J. said, the Payments
    Report is a necessary and normative analysis and part of the receiver’s fiduciary
    duties in  determining the financial situation of the bankrupt’s estate.  It
    will permit the stakeholders to learn and better understand the historical
    transactions of the insolvent business.  Moreover, the motion judge found
    that the receiver had considered all relevant interests relating to the administration
    of the Ravelston estate in its decision to complete the Payments Report and
    to file it with the court.  The interests that are relevant are those that
    are economic in nature, involving the debtor’s assets, property and undertaking.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Lord&nbsp;Black
    has raised no competing economic interest to delay the filing of the Payments
    Report on its completion.  Therefore, Cumming&nbsp;J. was correct in finding
    that his interest in avoiding possible prejudice in the American criminal
    proceedings was not a relevant interest to be weighed by the receiver in
    fulfilling its mandate to make business decisions in the best interests of
    the estate.  Lord&nbsp;Black’s alleged interest is not related to the administration
    of, or his economic interest in, the Ravelston estate.  His sole interest
    in seeking to prevent the disclosure of the Payments Report is in his capacity
    as defendant in the American criminal proceedings.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is noteworthy that Lord&nbsp;Black presented no evidence that the filing
    of the Payments Report would prejudice him in his capacity as a stakeholder
    having an economic interest in the Ravelston estate.  Nor did he adduce any
    evidence that the filing of the Report would prejudice his right to a fair
    trial in the criminal proceeding.  In my view, this is not surprising as
    it is difficult to understand how any relevant information in the Payments
    Report introduced in evidence by the United States Attorney could prejudice
    Lord&nbsp;Black’s right to a fair trial.  There is nothing unfair in the
    prosecution’s introduction of relevant and admissible evidence against a
    defendant in a criminal trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    see no viable argument that Cumming&nbsp;J. erred in principle in the exercise
    of his discretion in approving the filing of the Payments Report.  The proposed
    appeal has no realistic possibility of success if leave to appeal were granted
    as it raises no apparent error in law or palpable and overriding factual
    error.  In other words, Cumming&nbsp;J. made no apparent error in law or
    apparent palpable and overriding error of fact in his supervision of the
    receiver.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    for the second proposed ground of appeal, Lord&nbsp;Black contends that Cumming&nbsp;J.’s
    misapprehension of the principle of comity caused him to refuse to consider
    the prejudice to him from the use of the Payments Report by the USAO.  In
    my view, this contention is also untenable. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge’s comments in respect to comity were general in nature.  He
    stated that comity requires that each society, and its courts, must recognize
    and respect the legal processes of the courts of other societies, and that,
    accordingly, it would be for the United States District Court to determine
    the admissibility of any information contained in the Payments Report that
    the prosecution may seek to introduce against Lord&nbsp;Black in his criminal
    trial.  Cumming&nbsp;J. was never asked to rule on any foreign law or procedure,
    nor was evidence of a foreign law or procedure introduced.  He made it clear
    at para. 25 that “[t]he issue as to whether the Payments Report is to be
    filed in this Court is, of course, a mater for this Court alone”.  He properly
    recognized that there was nothing improper in the receiver voluntarily providing
    the information in the Payments Report to the USAO, especially where the
    information may be relevant to the administration of justice.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    see no viable argument that Cumming&nbsp;J. erred in principle in his comments
    on the principle of comity.  The proposed appeal has no realistic chance
    of success if leave to appeal were granted as it raises no apparent error
    in law or palpable and overriding factual error.</p>
