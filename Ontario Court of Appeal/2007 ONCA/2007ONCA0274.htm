  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals against conviction on the ground that
    his guilty plea was not voluntary and informed.  On the appellant’s behalf, duty counsel submits that this is
    supported by the evidence of defence counsel’s conduct in this case, including
    his alleged lack of preparedness for trial and his failure to obtain
    appropriate written instructions from his client to enter a guilty plea.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the appeal must be dismissed for the following
    reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no dispute that the incompetence of trial counsel is
    a very serious allegation that should be made only after very careful
    reflection.  There is a presumption of
    competence of counsel.  The test to
    displace this presumption is a high one.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, written instructions to enter a guilty plea were
    taken by defence counsel at trial.  Those instructions, however, provided for a guilty plea on a charge of
    breaking and entering only.  In fact,
    the charge in issue was breaking and entering a dwelling house and committing
    therein the indictable offence of sexual assault.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding this important defect in the language of the
    written instructions received, to the appellant’s knowledge throughout, there
    was only one charge at issue.  When the
    facts were read-in at trial, including the facts surrounding the allegation of
    sexual assault, the appellant made no objection, nor any comment indicating
    that he was not pleading to sexual assault or that he disputed the facts
    read-in.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial proceeding, including the sentence hearing,
    continued thereafter for several days, during which evidence was led regarding
    the sexual assault and the appellant himself testified.  Again, at no time did the appellant indicate
    that he had not intended to plead guilty to sexual assault or that he did not
    understand his plea.  Nor did he dispute
    the facts relevant to the sexual assault.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellant addressed the court prior to sentence
    being imposed.  Once again, there was no
    suggestion of any kind by him that his plea was uninformed or involuntary.  To the contrary, his comments to the court can
    be understood as indicating that he never intended that the complainant should
    be required to testify because he had intended to enter an early guilty plea.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, therefore, the appellant’s own conduct throughout
    this multi-day trial belies his claim that he did not intend to enter a guilty
    plea to the offence as charged and that he did not understand that he had done
    so.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal against conviction is dismissed.  We note that the appellant has abandoned his
    sentence appeal.</p>
