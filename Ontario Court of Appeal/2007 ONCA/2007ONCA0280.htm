      Killeen of the Superior Court of Justice.  </span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>GILLESE J.A.:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Shankar was convicted of two counts of possession of a loaded prohibited
    firearm, possession of a prohibited device, driving while disqualified, and
    public mischief.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    convictions stem from an incident on October 25, 2004.  Constables Bullick
    and Ordronneau were on routine patrol at 2:29 a.m. when they noticed Mr.
    Shankar’s car being driven without its tail lights illuminated.  They pulled
    the car over and asked Mr. Shankar for his licence, registration and insurance.  Mr.
    Shankar provided a driver’s licence in the name of Jason Singh, a yellow
    post-it note on which insurance information was handwritten, and a photocopy
    of the vehicle registration.  The photocopied registration was unusual because
    it contained a handwritten bill of sale.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    asked to spell the name on the licence, Mr. Shankar spelt the name “Sing” rather
    than “Singh”.  He also gave the wrong unit number of his ostensible address.  Constable
    Bullick knew the address that was given as a possible crack house and Mr.
    Shankar, who looked familiar to Bullick, fit the description of a crack dealer
    operating from that address.  Mr. Shankar also claimed to live at the address
    with his mother but Constable Bullick believed that no one fitting the mother’s
    description lived at the address.  In addition, Mr.&nbsp;Shankar explained
    that he was on his way to a night club; however, the club in question usually
    closed at 2:00 a.m.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Constables
    Bullick and Ordronneau then arrested Mr. Shankar for attempting to mislead
    them about his identity.  They had to physically remove Mr. Shankar from
    his car, at which time he told them they were not allowed to search the car.  When
    they patted him down for weapons, they discovered that he was wearing two
    bullet proof vests.  He explained that he needed them because people “want
    to kill me”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    police officers secured Mr.&nbsp;Shankar in the back seat of the police cruiser.  Constable
    Bullick then searched the car and found a semi-automatic hand pistol together
    with a fully loaded thirty-round ammunition clip in the trunk, and a hunting
    knife and a fully loaded nine-shot revolver in a shoulder holster in the
    locked glove box.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Shankar did not testify or call any evidence at trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    main dispute at trial was whether the police were permitted to search the
    car, incident to arrest.  The trial judge was of the view that the officers
    could have sought a search warrant quickly and without creating security
    issues.  “They chose not to do so and I believe the extended search was not
    reasonably necessary in the circumstances.”  On that basis, he concluded
    that the search constituted a breach of s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.  However,
    he found that Constables Bullick and Ordroneau acted in good faith throughout
    and he admitted the guns into evidence pursuant to s.24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Shankar appeals from conviction.  He argues that the guns ought not to have
    been admitted pursuant to s.&nbsp;24(2).  He contends that the police officers
    were ignorant of the scope of their powers and that such ignorance would
    preclude a finding of good faith and increase the seriousness of the breach.  On
    this view, he contends that the admission of the firearms would bring the
    administration of justice into disrepute.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown asks this court to reconsider the s.&nbsp;8 issue, arguing that the
    search flowed from the lawful arrest and was constitutional and proper.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, in my view, the trial judge erred in concluding
    that the officer’s search violated the appellant’s right under s.&nbsp;8
    of the <i>Charter</i> and I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>SECTION 8 </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    common law power to search incident to arrest endures under the <i>Charter</i>.  The
    power flows from a legal arrest, and there need not be separate reasonable
    and probable grounds that the search will yield evidence or weapons.  However,
    the scope of the power is constrained by its source, the legal arrest.  The
    main purposes of search incident to arrest have been articulated by the Supreme
    Court of Canada as follows:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>to
    ensure the safety of the police and the public;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>to
    prevent the destruction of evidence; and,</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>to
    discover evidence of the offence or offences for which the accused was arrested.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>See <i>R. v. Caslake</i> (1998),
    121 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at paras. 15-25 (S.C.C.) and <i>Cloutier v. Langlois</i> (1990),
    53 C.C.C. (3d) 257 at 270-278 (S.C.C.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    order for a search to be incidental to an arrest, the police must have one
    or more of the valid purposes in mind when the search is conducted, and there
    must be some reasonable basis for the belief that the purpose will be served.  In <i>Caslake</i>,
    Chief Justice Lamer stressed that this is not a standard of reasonable and
    probable grounds but, rather, a common sense observation that an objective
    or purpose cannot be valid if it is not reasonable to pursue it in the circumstances.  In
    making this observation, the Chief Justice cautioned that “[t]he police have
    considerable leeway in the circumstances of an arrest which they do not have
    in other situations” (para. 20).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    does not appear to be any issue that the appellant was lawfully arrested
    for attempting to mislead the police about his identity.  Both police officers
    testified that they subjectively believed that they had grounds to arrest
    the appellant on this basis and there was ample objective justification for
    the arrest.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    is there any doubt that the search was truly incidental to the arrest.  The
    search of the car flowed directly from the lawful arrest and was prompted
    by the nature and circumstances of the arrest.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his testimony, Constable Bullick explained that he had two purposes in searching
    the car:  to attempt to find documentation as to Mr. Shankar’s true identity
    and, out of a concern for public safety, to search for weapons.  Having lawfully
    arrested the appellant for attempting to mislead the police, it was proper
    to check the car for documents pertaining to his true identity.  Furthermore,
    the circumstances of the arrest and taking the appellant into custody gave
    rise to real concerns about safety, which made it appropriate to check the
    car for weapons.  The officer’s concern about public safety arose from the
    bullet-proof vests that the appellant was wearing, the appellant’s comments
    about people wanting to kill him, the time of night, and the fact that he
    believed that the appellant was involved in the crack cocaine trade.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    a fairly extensive search of the vehicle was conducted in this case, in my
    view, it was reasonable in the circumstances.  Those circumstances, as set
    out in para. 14 of the Crown’s factum, include the following:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    search followed a determination by Constable Bullick that it was merited
    in order to locate weapons and/or discover evidence as to the appellant’s
    true identity.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    was conducted pursuant to valid state objectives, i.e. public protection
    and the discovery and preservation of evidence which could be located at
    the scene of the arrest, and not for any oblique or improper motive.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    search was relatively non-intrusive.  It began with an inspection of the
    interior of the car, under the seats, and proceeded logically from there
    to the trunk and the glove box.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is a diminished expectation of privacy in a motor vehicle.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    was nothing abusive in the manner in which the search was conducted.  No
    damage was done to the car, no individuals were interfered with, and the
    seizures were selective and related to the purpose of the search.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Immediately
    upon finding the first gun, the Emergency Task Force was called so as to
    properly secure the guns and make them safe.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    consideration of the full circumstances of the case leads me to conclude
    that the search flowed directly from the lawful arrest and the circumstances
    of the arrest and was proper.  Accordingly, in my view, the trial judge erred
    in finding the search constituted a breach of s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>SECTION 24(2) </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    light of the foregoing conclusion, strictly speaking there is no need to
    go further and consider s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  Having said that,
    had it been necessary to decide the matter, I see no basis on which to interfere
    with the trial judge’s determination of this issue.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge articulated and applied the correct legal principles in his s.
    24(2) analysis.  The appellant’s only real quarrel is with the trial judge’s
    conclusion that the police officers acted in good faith, which he considered
    as a component of the seriousness of the <i>Charter</i> breach.  He argues
    that once the trial judge found that the police officers could have proceeded
    by way of obtaining a search warrant, he erred in failing to find that the
    breach was wilful and an act of bad faith.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    reaching his finding of good faith, the trial judge stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am entirely satisfied that these officers engaged
    in sound and good&#8209;faith&#8209;based investigative practices in their
    dealings with the accused even though their ultimate decision to search the
    vehicle without a warrant went too far.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>They [the police officers] legitimately stopped
    the accused and did not indulge thereafter in hectoring conduct with the
    accused as they attempted to get his explanation for his presence on the
    road and who he really was.  Looking at everything they did, notwithstanding
    the ultimate breach, I conclude they acted in good&#8209;faith throughout.  If
    what they did could not be characterized as good&#8209;faith police work,
    it seems to me the good&#8209;faith criterion would become a dead letter
    of our law.  As well, overall, I cannot conclude that this breach was anywhere
    near the upper level of seriousness.  The accused’s expectation of privacy
    could not be high here within the context of time and place….</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    reviewing court will not interfere with a trial judge’s conclusions in respect
    of s.24(2) absent an error of law or principle, or an unreasonable finding.  Deference
    is particularly important in the context of assessing the seriousness of
    the breach, which depends on factors generally established though testimony,
    such as the good faith of the police.  See <i>R. v. Law</i> (2002), 160 C.C.C.
    (3d) 449 at paras. 32-38 (S.C.C.) and <i>R. v. Buhay </i>(2002), 174 C.C.C.
    (3d) 97 at paras. 42-47 (S.C.C.). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, there is no basis for interfering with the trial judge’s determination
    that the police officers acted in good faith.  He made no error in law and
    deference is owed.  The officers testified about their purposes in searching
    the car and how these purposes were related to the arrest.  In the circumstances,
    their belief that they were permitted to search the vehicle was reasonable.  This
    is unlike <i>R. v. Clayton</i> (2005), 194 C.C.C. (3d) 289, in which this
    court held that the officers’ failure to consider the liberty interest of
    persons detained at a roadblock, and the failure of the police force to teach
    them to consider those interests, brought the administration of justice into
    disrepute.  Here, one of the police officers testified to having received
    training about search incident to arrest and the officers reasonably believed
    they had the grounds to proceed with the search.  Even if there is some question
    about the extent of such a search, this does not detract from the fact that
    they understood the principles underlying such searches.  Moreover, in light
    of the trial judge’s findings, it cannot be said that they disregarded the
    appellant’s rights. </p>
