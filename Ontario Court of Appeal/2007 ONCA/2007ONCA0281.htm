    9 of the <i>Limitations Act, 2002</i>, S.O. 2002, c. 24, Sch. B (the “new <i>Limitations
    Act</i>”) enables a potential defendant to have a litigation guardian appointed
    for a potential minor plaintiff.  That appointment can cause the limitation

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>

    Miron and her then three and a half year old daughter, Alexandra Miron-St-Georges,
    were injured in a motor vehicle accident on October 22, 1999.  Nathalie and
    Alexandra were passengers in a vehicle owned and operated by Richard St-Georges,
    Nathalie’s husband and Alexandra’s father, which collided head-on with a
    motor vehicle owned by Marcel Lemieux and operated by Luce Lemieux.  Sadly,
    Luce Lemieux died in the accident and Alexandra sustained a severe brain
    injury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

    continues to suffer from the effects of the brain injury.  An expert neuropsychologist
    has told Nathalie that it is too soon to determine whether Alexandra’s condition
    will improve or deteriorate over time.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>No
    legal proceeding has yet been commenced by Alexandra.  A number of other
    lawsuits have been commenced as a result of the accident.  It is possible
    that the insurance policies that might be a source of compensation to Alexandra
    will not cover all of the claims currently being advanced by all of the injured
    parties. </p>

    St-Georges’ insurers are defending the actions arising from the accident.  They
    brought a motion, pursuant to s. 9(2) of the new <i>Limitations Act</i>,
    for an order to appoint the Office of the Children’s Lawyer as the litigation
    guardian for Alexandra.  Nathalie Miron delivered a responding affidavit,
    on which she was cross&#8209;examined.</p>

    August 4, 2006, Karam J. made the order as requested but adjourned the motion

      to an order pursuant to s.&nbsp;9 of the new <i>Limitations Act</i>, it
      must be determined whether the new <i>Limitations Act</i> applies.  When
      making that determination, in circumstances such as those in this case,
      the usual starting point is the transition provisions in s. 24 of the new <i>Limitations
      Act</i>.  After all, the very purpose of transition provisions is to deal

    respondents argue, however, that the transition provisions in s. 24 of the
    new <i>Limitations Act </i>are inapplicable.  Their argument runs as follows.  Section
    24 refers to the “former limitation period”, that is, the limitation period
    that applied to the claim before the new <i>Limitations Act </i>came into
    force.  The former limitation period for Alexandra’s claim was two years:
    the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8.  The respondents contend
    that s. 47 of the former <i>Limitations Act </i>was only a rule for postponement
    of the operation of the limitation period and not a limitation period or
    part of the limitation period.  Consequently, they argue, s. 24 of the new <i>Limitations
    Act </i>did not apply and they were free to rely on s. 9 of the new <i>Limitations
    Act</i>.  <span

      to determine whether a claim that arose prior to January 1, 2004, is governed
      by the former or the new <i>Limitations Act</i>, the transition provisions

    January&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2004.  If so, s. 24(3) operates to bar Alexandra from
    bringing a proceeding in respect of her claim.  If not, s. 24(5) governs
    whether the former or the new <i>Limitations Act </i>applies to Alexandra’s
    claim.  It is only if the new <i>Limitations Act </i>applies that the respondents
    would have been entitled to an order pursuant to s. 9 of that Act.     </p>

    appellant argues that the “former limitation period” is to be interpreted
    in accordance with <i>Papamonolopoulos </i>and so is to be reckoned from
    the date when Alexandra attains the age of majority.  Thus, the former limitation
    period has not expired, the former <i>Limitations Act</i> applies and the
    respondents could not have recourse to s. 9 of the new <i>Limitations Act</i>.</p>

      accept the appellant’s argument in respect of the meaning to be given to
    “former limitation period”.  To take the strict interpretation of the words “former
    limitation period” urged by the respondents would lead to the conclusion
    that the former limitation period expired in relation to Alexandra’s claim
    before the new <i>Limitations Act </i>even came into effect.  Why?  Because,
    on that interpretation, the former limitation period was two years in duration.  As
    the accident occurred in October of 1999, the two year limitation period
    would have expired in October of 2001.  Section 24(3) of the new <i>Limitations
    Act </i>provides that if the former limitation period expired before January
    1, 2004, no proceeding can be commenced in respect of that claim.  Thus,
    acceding to the respondents’ position would result in the new <i>Limitations
    Act </i>having the effect of eliminating Alexandra’s claim before the new
    legislation came into effect and even though the then-governing law permitted
    it to continue.  </span></p>

      would take very clear language on the part of the legislature to abrogate
      existing rights before such a construction would be warranted.  There is
      no suggestion in the new <i>Limitations Act </i>that minors in Alexandra’s
      position were to be stripped of their rights to commence legal proceedings
      without warning and for no reason.   This absurd result is avoided if the
      words
    “former limitation period” are interpreted in accordance with </span><i>Papamonolopoulos</i> and
    the limitation period does not begin to run until a minor reaches the age
    of majority.</p>

      pursuant to the motion below, including her responding affidavit and the
      transcript of her cross&#8209;examination thereon, be permanently sealed
      and not available to any person.  She argues that because the Order was
      made without authority, the evidence was not produced in a legal proceeding
      and it ought not, therefore, to be available in future court proceedings.  In
      making this argument, the appellant relies on this court’s decision in <i>TD
      Insurance Home and Auto v. Sivakumar (Litigation Guardian of) </i>(2006),
      80 O.R. (3d) 671.   </span></p>

      accept that Alexandra has commenced no legal proceeding.  Moreover, as
      will be apparent from the foregoing reasons, I accept that the motion judge
      did not have the power, pursuant to s. 9 of the new <i>Limitations Act</i>,
      to make the Order.  As I have explained, the new <i>Limitations Act </i>does
      not apply to Alexandra’s claim.  However, just because Alexandra has commenced
      no action and the Order was made without authority, it does not necessarily
      follow that the evidence submitted on the motion was obtained without legal
      authority.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

      respondents brought the motion below in order to have a litigation guardian
      appointed pursuant to s. 9 of the new <i>Limitations Act</i>.  However,
      it is important to note that there were two aspects to that motion.  The
      first was a question of application – did the new <i>Limitations Act </i>apply
      in the circumstances of this case?  The second question was dependent on
      the answer to the first:  if the new <i>Limitations Act </i>did apply,
      ought the motion to be granted?  Section 9(2) expressly provides that a
      potential defendant “may make an application or a motion to have a litigation
      guardian appointed for a potential plaintiff”.  Thus, it is apparent that
      the respondents had the right to make the motion if only to have a determination
      as to the availability of s. 9.  It follows that the court had the right
      to hear it and to receive any evidence filed in relation thereto.  A motion
      is a legal proceeding.  Thus, in my view, the evidence was produced in
      a legal proceeding.   </span></p>

        Insurance</i>, Borins J.A. held that a judge did not have jurisdiction
        to order that evidence be preserved prior to the commencement of a proceeding
        because rule 36 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, the authority
        for making such an order, specifies that it applies only when a proceeding
        has already been commenced.  In the present case, as I have explained,
        although no legal proceeding has been commenced by Alexandra, the respondents
        were entitled to bring the motion in an attempt to obtain a s. 9 order.  In
        that sense, a proceeding had been commenced.      </span></p>

      137(2) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> gives the court the authority
      to make a sealing order.  However, as Goudge J.A. reiterated in the recent
      case of <i>CTV Television Inc. v. Ontario Superior Court of Justice </i>(2002),
      59 O.R. (3d) 18, court records should be open to the public and public
      accessibility should be curtailed only with the greatest reluctance.  Although
      these comments were made in the context of access to documents in a criminal
      proceeding, the same principles inform access to documents in a civil proceeding:  public
      accessibility fosters public confidence in the integrity of the court system
      and is to be curtailed only in compelling circumstances.    </span></p>

      is up to the person seeking the sealing order to demonstrate a public interest

      to provide evidence to meet that burden.  She argues that a sealing order
      is necessary in order to avoid any potential prejudice to Alexandra, should
      Alexandra bring a claim in the future.  The possibility of such prejudice
      is insufficient, in my view, to amount to evidence of a public interest
