style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was the respondent Andrea Barker’s treating
    physician.  The trial judge found that
    his care of Ms. Barker fell below the standard of care expected of a prudent
    and careful surgeon and that this breach caused her to lose five feet of small
    intestine for which he awarded damages in the amount of $129,745.62 plus
    pre-judgment interest and costs.  Ms.
    Barker’s husband, Derek Stack, was awarded $10,000.00 plus pre-judgment
    interest for his claim under the <i>Family
    Law Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990 c.F.3.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals on the ground that the trial judge erred
    in finding a breach of the standard of care and, in the alternative, erred in
    concluding that the breach caused the loss of the section of the small
    intestine.  For the reasons that follow,
    I would allow the appeal on the alternative ground, set aside the judgment and
    dismiss the claim.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>Preliminary
    Motion</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the hearing of the appeal, the appellant brought a motion
    seeking permission to file a supplementary compendium containing the experts’
    reports that were served prior to trial but not filed as exhibits, as well as
    some correspondence.  The appellant also
    sought to file a supplementary factum that dealt with the importance of
    considering these reports, as well as recent case law.  The respondents opposed this motion and
    filed materials in support of their position.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As is the practice in this court, we advised counsel to
    proceed with their submissions on the merits of the appeal and to address the
    issues raised by the motion and the materials sought to be filed as part of
    these submissions.  We reserved judgment
    on the motion and on the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With the exception of the request to file that portion of the
    supplementary factum dealing with recent case law, I would dismiss the
    motion.  The experts’ reports are of
    little assistance in this court’s review of the trial decision as they were not
    filed at the trial and were therefore not considered by the trial judge.  With respect to the exchange of
    correspondence, it addresses principally the availability of witnesses at trial
    and I consider it of no assistance to this court in resolving the issues on
    appeal.  As to that portion of the
    supplementary factum dealing with recent case law, I see no difficulty in
    receiving this document as it is of assistance to the court and is not
    seriously objected to by the respondents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents asked for costs of the motion.  As the motion was largely unsuccessful, I
    would normally make such an order.  In
    light of my proposed disposition of the appeal, I would not award the
    respondents costs, but rather take the costs of this motion into account in
    fixing the costs of the appeal.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Barker had been followed for years for abdominal pain, the
    cause of which remained uncertain.  At
    about 12:03 a.m. on April 4, 2000, she attended at the emergency department of
    the Montfort Hospital suffering from abdominal pain and vomiting.  She was seen and then released at about 4:19
    a.m. with a diagnosis of urinary tract infection.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Barker returned to the emergency department that evening
    as her condition had worsened.  She was
    x-rayed and diagnosed as having a partial bowel obstruction.  The appellant, a general surgeon, was her
    treating physician.  The treatment he
    adopted was to stop the intake of food, provide intravenous fluids, insert a
    nasogastric suction device and then observe the patient in the hope that the
    problem would resolve itself (referred to as conservative management).  Expert testimony at trial confirmed that
    this was the appropriate treatment and that, in the large majority of cases,
    the problem would resolve itself without surgical intervention within
    twenty-four to forty-eight hours.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Barker remained in hospital under observation until about 8:00
    a.m. on the morning of April 6.  At that
    time the appellant determined that Ms. Barker’s condition had deteriorated to
    the point where she now suffered from peritonitis.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Barker was then processed for surgery and, due in part to
    delays in securing the necessary consent from her spouse, the operation did not
    occur until about 1:00 p.m. on April 6.  Upon operating, the appellant saw that Ms. Barker had a volvulus, an
    abnormal twisting of the small bowel.  This volvulus had cut off the blood supply to a five-foot section of the
    bowel.  As a result, this section of the
    bowel had died and become gangrenous and had to be removed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, the reconnection of the bowel after the removal
    of the dead portion was not completely successful and, on April 19, Ms. Barker
    had to undergo a second surgery to repair a small hole at the site of the
    reconnection.  Ms. Barker remained at
    Montfort Hospital for several days more during which time she lost weight and
    her general health deteriorated.  At her
    request she was transferred to another hospital on April 29.  After a long period of recuperation, she has
    recovered except that as a result of having lost a significant portion of her
    bowel she now suffers from small bowel syndrome.</p>

    issue on this appeal (i.e. the time leading up to and including the first
    surgery).  The following is a chronology
    of the key events from Ms. Barker’s initial attendance at the emergency
    department on April 4 until her operation on April 6.  </p>

    appropriate standard of care.  This
    finding was based largely on nurses’ notes from the evening of April 5,
    contained in the hospital records.  According to the trial judge, these notes indicated that Ms. Barker’s
    condition had been deteriorating throughout the evening of April 5 and that the
    appellant had been called three times and informed of the situation.  The trial judge concluded that the appellant
    should have attended to assess Ms. Barker’s condition that evening rather than
    wait until 8:00 a.m. the following morning.  Had the appellant attended at the hospital, he would or should have
    found that her condition had in fact deteriorated to the point where an
    immediate operation was necessary.  Had
    he operated that evening rather than at 1.00 p.m. the following day, it was
    more probable than not that the volvulus would have been discovered sooner and
    the five-foot section of bowel would have been saved.  This is because, according to the trial judge, the volvulus had
    cut off the blood supply to that section of the bowel during the evening of
    April 5 and according to expert testimony, the bowel takes approximately eight
    hours to die after the blood supply to it has been cut off.  By operating that evening, the volvulus
    would have been discovered and corrected before any permanent injury was
    suffered.</p>

    liability, as appears from the pleadings, was that Ms. Barker ought to have
    been operated on either at the time of her first visit to emergency early on
    the morning of April 4 or alternatively, early on April 5, after she returned
    to the emergency department and had been admitted to hospital with a diagnosis
    of a partially obstructed bowel.  The

    supporting this theory of liability.  </p>

    refuting these theories.  Having
    rejected both of these theories of liability, the trial judge ought to have
    dismissed the claim.  Instead, the trial
    judge found that the appellant was negligent in not operating late in the
    evening of April 5.  This allegation had
    not been made by the respondents at trial and was never addressed in the
    evidence or by the experts.  The
    appellant submits that there was neither an evidentiary basis nor expert
    opinion evidence in support of such a theory of liability.  Because this theory had not been pleaded,
    the appellant maintains that he was never provided with an opportunity to
    respond to it.  The trial judge’s
    finding of negligence should, therefore, be set aside. </p>

    which Ms. Barker was under the appellant’s care was in issue.  The claim focused specifically on the period
    running from the morning of April 5 to the morning of April 6.  The statement of claim alleged that the
    appellant “failed to act with any diligence in the assessment and treatment of
    [Ms. Barker], as he did not order a second series of x-rays or take any action
    of any consequence until a full day following (i.e. April 6) his assuming
    responsibility of her care.  [Ms.
    Barker] states that this refusal to act was in spite of insistences by [Ms.
    Barker’s spouse] that her condition was rapidly deteriorating and clearly
    required more investigation and/or surgery.”</p>

    of intervention, i.e., the evening of April 4 and morning of April 5, the
    respondents’ theory of the case was nonetheless that the appellant had not
    properly responded to the signs that Ms. Barker’s condition was deteriorating
    and that surgery ought to have been undertaken well before 1:00 p.m. on April
    6.  This theory of the respondents’ case
    was well understood.  The trial judge’s
    finding that the operation ought to have been carried out in the evening of
    April 5 is, therefore, not a totally new theory of liability.</p>

    of <i>Rodaro v. Royal Bank of Canada</i> (2002), 59 O.R. (3d) 74 (C.A.), <i>Grass (Litigation Guardian of) v. Women’s
    College Hospital</i> (2005), 75 O.R. (3d) 85 (C.A.) and <i>TSP-Intl Ltd. v.
    Mills</i> (2006), 212 O.A.C. 66 (C.A.).  In those cases the theory on which the trial judge’s finding of
    liability was based had not been pleaded or advanced in the course of the
    trial.  In the present case the theory
    of liability had always been that the appellant delayed treatment and, specifically,
    delayed operating on Ms. Barker until it was too late.  The parties each suggested different times
    as being the proper time to operate and the trial judge chose a time in between
    the two.</p>

    surprise by the respondents’ failure to specifically point to the evening of
    April 5 as being the time at which the operation ought to have been carried
    out.  In the examination in chief of the
    appellant, he was asked by his counsel: “Now, it might be suggested in this
    action that you should have considered surgery on that day, on April 5<sup>th</sup>.  What do you respond to these
    allegations?”  The appellant, therefore,
    understood that the respondents were suggesting that the whole of April 5 was

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    evidence clearly indicates that the patient’s condition deteriorated all
    through the evening of April 5 and the early morning hours of April 6.  The nurse on duty was sufficiently concerned
    to call Dr. Dervish at 9:00 p.m. about a pain under the rib cage.  She took the patient’s electrolytes and
    called Dr. Dervish back with the results at 9:30.  A little later on, the nurse examined the patient’s abdomen and
    her notes indicate “states pain under the rib cage less intense now abdomen
    very sensitive to touch especially lower abd. – firm to touch and moderately
    distended.  Dr. Dervish called and
    advised of Foley output and change in abdomen”.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    alone, it is difficult for the court to evaluate the degree of
    deterioration.  However, the only

    was sufficiently concerned to call the surgeon.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>[63] What leads me to conclude
    definitely that Ms. Barker’s condition deteriorated starting in the evening of
    April 5, and that Dr. Dervish was aware of this is Dr. Dervish’s own note made
    on the morning of April 6, 2000 (at B63 Exhibit 3) where he writes “worsening
    condition since last night”.  He had not
    seen the patient since mid-day of the previous day and all his information on

    Ms. Barker’s stay at Montfort Hospital, which was filed and made an exhibit in
    the action.  The appellant maintains that
    the notes could not be used by the trial judge to base a finding of negligence
    for the following reasons: </p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;
'>(a) Although the
    records were entered on consent, the appellant had reserved the right to
    challenge their accuracy and would likely have done so with respect to these
    notes had he been told they might be relied on by the trial judge;</p>
  <p align=left style='

    opinions and could not be relied on unless the nurses who made the notes were
    called as witnesses;</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;
'>(c) the notes were
    never put to the appellant to obtain his comments.  He was never asked to confirm that they accurately reflected
    information that was conveyed to him that night nor was he asked why he did not
    attend at the hospital as a result of receiving this information; and</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;
'>(d) the notes were not
    referred to throughout the trial, nor were they commented upon by the
    experts.  The trial judge appears to
    have interpreted these notes based exclusively on his personal review of them
    drawing inferences and conclusions that could only be made with the assistance
    of experts and after receiving submissions from counsel.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant therefore submits that the trial judge erred in
    using these notes to base his finding of negligence.  On this record, the trial judge was in no position to interpret
    these notes as demonstrating a worsening in Ms. Barker’s condition so as to
    warrant the appellant’s attendance at the hospital that evening.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the notes recorded observations made by the nurses
    and were admitted and relied upon by the trial judge as business records
    pursuant to s. 35 of the <i>Evidence Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.E.23.<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a>  They were properly before the court and were
    clearly relevant as they related to a critical period of Ms. Barker’s
    care.  Neither party chose to call the
    nurses who made the notes nor did they seek to challenge their accuracy.  Further, the trial judge did not rely
    exclusively on the notes to make his finding that Ms. Barker’s condition had
    deteriorated during the evening of April 5.  First, the trial judge’s finding is supported by the note made by the
    appellant in the hospital record on the morning of April 6.  The appellant observed “worsening condition
    since last night,” suggesting that he interpreted the nurses’ notes in the same
    way as the trial judge.  As explained by
    Dr. Latulippe, the appellant’s expert, in community hospitals such as the
    Montfort, when doctors are away from the hospital they rely on the hospital’s
    nurses to monitor their patients and advise them of changes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the trial judge had the benefit of expert evidence as
    to the science of bowel obstructions and the process of conservative management
    or watchful waiting during which the patient is observed for symptoms of
    possible complications.  This evidence
    assisted the trial judge in making his findings of fact based on his
    interpretation of the hospital records. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the trial judge was entitled to consider the overall
    context and circumstances including the fact that the nurses made three
    telephone calls to the appellant that evening – the third occurring sometime
    after 11:00 p.m.  In addition, it is of
    some significance that, by the evening of April 5, approximately forty-eight
    hours had elapsed since Ms. Barker’s first attendance at the hospital emergency
    department and over twenty-four hours since her admission following her second
    attendance.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also objects to the use the trial judge made of
    this finding.  The appellant correctly
    observes that none of the experts was specifically asked to address the nurses’
    notes or asked whether the appellant’s failure to attend at the hospital that
    evening breached the standard of care.  However, the trial judge properly considered the expert evidence to
    determine the appropriate standard of care and then simply applied this
    standard to the findings of fact he made.</p>

line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The expert evidence was to the effect that watchful waiting
    was the appropriate treatment for the respondent’s condition but that watchful
    waiting should end and surgery should be performed if the patient’s condition
    deteriorates or, if after a certain period of careful observation, there is no
    improvement in the patient’s condition.  Further, surgery should be immediately performed at the first signs of
    peritonitis, namely rebound tenderness and rigidity or guarding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge canvassed the expert evidence and, based on
    it, determined the appropriate standard of care.  It is against this standard of care that he considered the
    appellant’s conduct.  The trial judge
    found: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[The appellant]
    was not keenly aware that the standard of care required him to operate as soon
    as the patient’s condition worsened.  Nowhere in his evidence does he appear to have been focusing on the
    possibility, although rare, that a volvulus could be at play and that a close
    observation was also required for that purpose… Nowhere in [the appellant’s]
    evidence does he indicate that he felt he was obliged to proceed with surgery
    if Ms. Barker’s condition worsened...  His approach appeared to be to wait, possibly for up to four days.  Surgery would be required only after no
    improvement for four (4) days or immediately upon finding signs of peritonitis.</p>

    that Ms. Barker’s condition had deteriorated during the evening of April 5,
    that the standard of care was that such deterioration meant that Ms. Barker
    should be operated on and that because this was not done the appellant breached
    the applicable standard of care.  These
    findings are entitled to deference in this court.  I would therefore not give effect to the first ground of appeal.</p>

    addressed the issue of causation.  As it
    is central to this appeal, the relevant portion of his reasons is set out in
    full:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>By the time her condition started
    deteriorating, at 9:00 p.m. on April 5, less than 24 hours had elapsed since
    the initiation of the conservative measures.  Surgery should not have been delayed further.  Unfortunately, surgery was carried out only over 15 hours after
    that critical time.  There is ample
    evidence, which I accept, that a volvulus evolves progressively.  It is fair to conclude that a volvulus will
    only progress to a state where the bowel is completely strangulated over a
    period of time.  Dr. Axler, a specialist
    in the field, testified that a volvulus would usually proceed through
    stages.  First, a partial twisting, then
    to a full twist or more as the case may be.  Complete strangulation of the bowel will only come with time.  It is only at that point that the biological
    clock will start.  The evidence of Dr.
    Latulippe is that the biological clock is 8 hours.  I find that the volvulus only started to develop during the
    evening of April 4.  At approximately
    11:00 p.m. on April 4, conservative measures generally relieving pressure on
    the bowel were instituted.  I find that
    the volvulus evolved to a full strangulation during the evening of April
    5.  I conclude that it is more likely than
    not that surgery at 11:00 p.m., or thereabouts, on April 5 would have been in
    time to save [Ms. Barker’s] bowel.  I
    also find that waiting an additional 14 hours in the circumstances curtailed
    any chance of saving the bowel because it is more likely than not that the
    biological clock had expired during that time.  I therefore conclude that [the appellant’s] breach more probably than
    not caused [Ms. Barker’s] loss of over five feet of small intestine, ultimately
    caused [Ms. Barker’s] short bowel syndrome with which she will be afflicted for
    life and greatly increased her period of recovery.</span></p>

    volvulus evolved to a full strangulation during the evening of April 5” is not
    clear, it appears that he relied on the fact that Ms. Barker’s condition
    deteriorated during that time, as observed by the nurses between 8:50 p.m. and
    11:15 p.m. on April 5.<a href="#_ftn3"

    conclude that the observations made by the nurses in the evening of April 5
    were signs of the type of deterioration that warranted ending the watchful
    waiting period, there was no basis for concluding that these observations of
    deterioration established, on a balance of probabilities, that full
    strangulation of Ms. Barker’s bowel occurred during this period and that
    surgery at that point would have saved the section of the bowel.  The expert testimony was to the effect that
    a volvulus could not be diagnosed before surgery.  The experts did not give evidence as to the clinical signs or specific
    symptoms of a full volvulus.  There was
    no evidence outlining what the trial judge characterized as the progress to
    full strangulation.  This concept of the
    volvulus progressing in this way was not explored with Dr. Latulippe and only
    touched on by Dr. Axler, the respondents’ expert.  There was no evidence explaining what, if anything, can be
    observed as a volvulus develops to full strangulation.</p>

    April 5 were not put to the experts nor were the experts asked whether
    observations of this kind signalled or were consistent with the formation of a
    full volvulus.  Quite to the contrary,
    Dr. Axler was of the view that compromise to the bowel had likely occurred several
    days before the operation and by the time of surgery the bowel had been dead
    for several days.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[5]</span></a>  This view is in accord with Dr. Latulippe’s
    testimony that, in hindsight, the volvulus<a
href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[6]</span></a> was probably present in the morning of April 5.  I take that statement to mean that, in his view, the portion of
    the bowel would likely have died that afternoon, some six to eight hours
    later.  Dr. Latulippe’s and Dr. Axler’s
    evidence to the effect that the bowel likely died before or during the
    afternoon of April 5 is also consistent with<span lang=EN-US> the expert evidence that, after the bowel dies, the patient’s condition
    worsens and peritonitis develops.  Although the record does not indicate how soon after the death of the
    bowel symptoms of peritonitis appear<a
href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[7]</span></a>,
    the observations made during the evening of April 5 and morning of April 6 are
    consistent with the bowel having died sometime during the afternoon of
    April&nbsp;5.  The worsening in Ms.
    Barker’s condition noted by the nursing staff in the course of the evening of
    April 5 might well be caused by the deteriorating condition of the dead section
    of bowel and indicate the onset of peritonitis.</span></p>

    base a finding that the volvulus developed to full strangulation during the
    evening of April 5.  To the limited
    extent that the experts addressed the issue, that evidence is more consistent
    with a finding that the full volvulus was in place well before then.  In my view, the trial judge, having found
    negligence on the part of the appellant, simply inferred that it was the delay
    in carrying out the operation that caused the death of the section of
    bowel.  There was no medical or other

    have relied to conclude that full strangulation of the bowel occurred during
    the evening of April 5, I must nonetheless consider whether, on this record,
    there is another basis to reach the conclusion that, but for the negligence of
    the appellant, the bowel would have been salvageable.  A convenient starting point is to estimate when the operation
    would likely have occurred had the appellant not been negligent and had he
    attended at the hospital in the evening of April 5 as a result of the calls he
    received from the nurses.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    at 11:00 p.m. on April 5 but for the appellant’s negligence.  He did not explain how he arrived at the
    conclusion that the operation would have occurred at this precise time.  The record reveals that the last of the
    three calls made by the nurses during the evening of April 5, the one in which
    the appellant was advised of the change in Ms. Barker’s abdomen, was at 11:00
    p.m.  The note describes the nurse’s
    observation as “pain under rib cage less intense now.  Abdomen very sensitive to touch especially lower abdomen – firm
    to touch and moderately distended”.  This appears to be the point at which the trial judge found that the
    appellant ought to have decided to attend at the hospital.  Clearly, as the appellant was not yet at the
    hospital, the operation could not have occurred at that time.  There was no evidence as to how long the
    appellant would reasonably have taken to attend at the hospital and examine the
    patient.  Nor was there evidence of how
    long it would have taken to obtain the necessary consents and assemble the
    staff required to carry out the operation.</p>

    been carried out, I will use as a guide the time it took Ms. Barker to reach
    surgery after the appellant decided to operate on the morning of April 6.  We know that the appellant determined to
    carry out the surgery at about 8:30 a.m. on April 6, but that the operation did
    not proceed for several hours because of necessary delays and Ms. Barker’s
    spouse’s delay in providing the necessary consent.  In fact, it was 1:30 p.m. when the surgery commenced.  The volvulus was then observed and
    correction became possible.  In other
    words, it took approximately five hours from the point where the decision to
    operate was made to the point where the volvulus could have been corrected.</p>

    approximately one hour for the appellant to attend at the hospital and examine
    Ms. Barker after the 11:00 p.m. call, but for the appellant’s breach of the
    standard of care, it is likely that the bowel would have been observed in
    surgery at approximately 5:00 a.m. on April 6.  Whether I assume that the operation would have been carried out at 5:00
    a.m. on April 6 or accept the trial judge’s finding that it could have been
    carried out at 11:00 p.m. on April 5, immediately after the appellant received
    the call from the nurse advising him of the change in Ms. Barker’s abdomen, the
    result is the same.  On this record
    there is simply no basis for finding that on a balance of probabilities, the
    section of the bowel died after 11:00 p.m. on April 5.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In order to conclude that the appellant’s negligence caused
    the loss, the respondents had to prove that but for this negligence, the bowel
    could have been saved on a balance of probabilities.  Assuming that the trial judge’s finding that the operation could
    have been carried out at 11:00 p.m. on April 5 was correct, this could be done
    directly by leading expert evidence that, based on a review of the records,
    including the pathology report on the portion of the bowel that was removed,
    the bowel had likely been necrotic for less than fourteen and a half hours when
    it was removed by the appellant at 1:30 p.m. on April 6.  This would mean that if the appellant had
    not been negligent and the operation had been carried out at about 11:00 p.m.
    on April 5 rather than 1:30 p.m. on April 6, the bowel would likely have been saved.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, no expert was asked for an opinion as to whether the
    section of the bowel, when removed, had been necrotic for less than fourteen
    and a half hours.  This is likely due to
    the fact that the position advanced by the respondents at trial was that the
    operation ought to have occurred much sooner, either on April 4 or early on
    April 5, at which time causation would have been much less of an issue.  From the appellant’s perspective, he
    maintained that there had been no negligence and that the operation was carried
    out at the appropriate time.  On this
    theory, there was no issue as to causation.</p>

    died approximately eight hours later.</p>

    no way of determining on this record whether the volvulus was formed on April
    3, 4, or 5.  The evidence, therefore,
    does not establish that it is more likely than not that the bowel would have
    been alive and salvageable at the time surgery ought to have been
    performed.  In the absence of evidence
    as to when, within the April 3 to 5 timeframe, the volvulus formed, I conclude
    that the respondents have done no more than show that surgery carried out some
    eight to fourteen hours earlier would have afforded Ms. Barker a chance of
    avoiding the injury.  This does not
    satisfy the requirement of showing that an earlier surgery would, more likely
    than not, have avoided the injury (see <i>Cottrelle

    alter the state of the law on causation.  Rather it confirmed that “the basic test for determining causation

    present case, the respondents’ have not shown that it was impossible to prove
    that the delay in carrying out the operation caused Ms. Barker’s injury on a
    balance of probabilities.  As I noted
    earlier, none of the experts was specifically asked to consider the pathology
    report on the removed portion of the bowel and other evidence to give an
    opinion on the impact of operating at 1:30 p.m. on April 6 rather than at 11:00
    p.m. on April 5 (or within several hours thereafter) nor were they asked
    whether such an opinion could be given.  That said, the evidence that was led and that generally addressed the
    point at which the bowel likely died was unfavourable to the respondents.  The respondents’ expert, Dr. Axler,
    testified that the section of the bowel had likely been dead for several days
    leaving little doubt as to what his opinion on causation would have been if
    asked whether the bowel could have been saved if the operation had been carried
    out some eight to fourteen hours earlier that it was.  The appellant’s expert, Dr. Latulippe, expressed the view that,
    in hindsight, he believed the volvulus was likely present on the morning of
    April 5, suggesting that he also would have opined that an operation carried
    out after 11:00 p.m. on April 5 would not likely have saved the portion of the

    negligent delay in operating.  Assuming
    that a positive medical opinion could not have been obtained in this case, the
    “but for” test allows for the application of the robust and pragmatic approach:
    see <i>Snell v. Farrell, supra, </i>at para.
    44.  Under that approach the respondents
    nonetheless have to provide an evidentiary foundation for finding that there is
    a substantial connection between the injury and the defendant’s conduct.  As I have noted in the earlier portion of
    this decision, no such foundation was laid in the present case.  There is a complete absence of medical or
    other evidence from which to infer that, but for the delay in operating, the

    blood supply to areas of the bowel that aren’t twisted but simply being
    deprived of their blood supply, they too may die, and so the length of bowel
    that’s resected may get extended, if you will, in terms of the length of the
    bowel that needs to be resected.”  Here,
    Dr. Dubinsky was simply describing potential complications.  He was not suggesting that, in Ms. Barker’s
    case, any portion of the bowel beyond the section impaired by the volvulus had
    become necrotic and had to be removed.</p>

    obstruction.  The opinion of the doctors
    was that the most likely cause of the partial obstruction was adhesions or
    scarring from her prior medical treatment. A period of watchful waiting was
    initiated to determine if this was indeed the cause of the partial obstruction.
    The trial judge accepted the evidence of Dr. Latulippe, the appellant’s expert,
    that the period of watchful waiting could vary between 24 to 48 hours if the
    patient’s condition remains stable.  Dr.
    Latulippe further testified that when the condition of a patient undergoing

    of a volvulus had likely occurred several days before the operation and that,
    by the time of surgery, the bowel had been dead for several days. While that
    was Dr. Axler’s opinion, the trial judge clearly rejected it. No palpable and
    overriding error has been shown respecting the trial judge’s conclusion in this
    regard and the trial judge’s finding is therefore entitled to deference on this
    point.  I strongly disagree that Dr.
    Latulippe’s opinion, that the volvulus was likely present on the morning of
    April 5, meant that the respondent’s bowel would likely have died some six to
    eight hours later.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Instead, Dr. Latulippe testified that a volvulus can exist for
    a period of time without problem but that eventually the twisting will create
    an obstruction.  He explained that the
    intestine can be likened to a long tube floating freely in the abdominal cavity.  There are vascular attachments holding it
    but it can twist on itself.  Once it
    twists on itself, it can exist in this state without a problem, but eventually
    the twisting will create an obstruction and cut off the flow of blood. He
    stated at p.1169 of his evidence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span

    considerér l’intestin comme un long tube, puis l’intestin est libre dans la

    certain qu’il y a des attaches vasculaires qui le retiennent, mais a
    l’intérieur de sa liberté, il peut venire se tordre sure lui-même.  En se tordant sur lui-même, il peut être

line-height:normal'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Latulippe also testified that a volvulus can resolve by
    untwisting of its own accord.  If it
    does not, it will progressively strangle the bowel.  He agreed that <i>after</i> a
    volvulus strangles the bowel cutting off the flow of blood, that portion of the
    bowel lives for a period of six to eight hours.</p>

    around midday or about twelve hours after her admission to the hospital.  She had had the urine from her bowel drained
    by a Foley catheter, her pain level showed significant improvement, and the
    distension of her stomach that had been previously observed had
    disappeared.  The appellant was able to
    palpitate the respondent’s abdomen more easily.  The appellant consulted with the radiologist and was advised that
    the x-rays showed a partial intestinal obstruction.  At that time, the appellant testified that his examination
    revealed no signs of peritonitis. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two of the signs of peritonitis are guarding and rebound
    tenderness. “Guarding” is an involuntary reflex contraction of the muscles of
    the abdomen when the examining person pushes on it.  Another sign, “rebound tenderness,” occurs when the examiner
    presses on an area and it is not the fact of pressing but of releasing the
    pressure that causes pain.  Dr.
    Latulippe also testified that the respondent’s chart indicated that no signs of
    peritonitis were present at this time.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having regard to the improvement in the respondent’s condition
    and to the absence of peritonitis, I would hold that it was open to the trial
    judge to infer that, although a volvulus was present, it had not progressed to
    fully strangle the respondent’s bowel and cause it to die by noon of April
    5.  </p>

    expressed at para. 40 of his reasons, that the respondent’s bowel quietly died
    during the afternoon of April 5. Dr. Latulippe agreed that as a bowel
    obstruction develops, the magnitude of the signs and symptoms of pain
    increases. He also testified that the pain associated with an intestinal
    blockage begins, becomes very high, diminishes and can even disappear.  The magnitude of the pain experienced by the
    appellant beginning at about 8:50 pm on April 5 increased and followed the
    pattern described by Dr. Latulippe. </p>

    that the respondent complained of pain under her rib cage and that the pain was
    more intense when deep breaths were taken.  This was significant.  The x-rays
    taken when the respondent was in the emergency ward and which the appellant had
    discussed with the radiologist revealed dark or blackish structures close to
    the image of the ribs.  At 11&nbsp;p.m.,
    although the pain under the rib cage was less intense, the respondent’s abdomen
    was “<i>very sensitive to touch”</i> and “<i>moderately distended”</i>.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span

    drawn from the fact that the nurses called the appellant, Dr. Latulippe
    testified that in a regional hospital, the doctors have a tendency to rely
    greatly on experienced nursing personnel.  He added:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span

    according to Dr. Latulippe, nurses will call a doctor when a patient’s
    condition is deteriorating and the doctor will rely on them to do so.  The trial judge quoted this passage at para.

    the appellant three times between 9 and 11&nbsp;p.m.  </p>

    peritonitis to the start of the loop in the bowel becoming necrotic.</i> The
    longer the bowel was in a necrotic state, the more infection. He testified: </p>

    liquid will become trouble because, even in the absence of an open perforation,
    bacteria can pass through the wall of the necrotic intestine.  One can then speak of purulent (pussy)

    the progression of the respondent’s pain, the stages of peritonitis and the

    Supreme Court cited with approval the decision of <i>Sentilles v. Inter-Caribbean Shipping Corp.</i>, 361 U.S. 107 (1959) at
    109-110.  That case held that the power
    of the trier of fact to draw the inference that the plaintiff’s condition was
    aggravated by the defendant’s negligence was not impaired by the failure of any
    medical witness to testify that this was in fact the cause.  Further:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Neither can it
    be impaired by the lack of medical unanimity as to the respective likelihood of

    [triers of fact] not the medical witnesses, were sworn to make a legal

    after the need for surgery was indicated, the respondent should have been
    transferred to another hospital.  Moreover, when the culprit in causing injury is a delay in treatment, a
    reasonable delay at the end of the chain of events cannot be used as a factor
    to insulate physicians from liability for their negligence in causing the
    initial delay: <i>Law Estate v. Simice </i>(1994),

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A volvulus means
    that the bowel is twisted in such a way that it’s cut off from it’s blood
    supply.  When that happens, there is a
    very time-limited window of opportunity in which, if the patient is fortunate
    enough to get access to surgical therapy, the bowel can sometimes be untwisted
    and, as a consequence of that untwisting, remain viable so that the patient
    doesn’t require a bowel resection at all.  So that’s the first opportunity if you will.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The second thing
    that happens is that when the bowel has remained twisted for a period of time
    and becomes necrotic or dies, it is necessary, it’s unavoidable to resect that
    piece of bowel…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>One of the
    things that certainly happens is that, as the fluid begins to gather, the
    patient becomes more and more in a worse state of shock and, as a consequence
    of that worsened state of shock, the blood flow to the portions of bowel
    adjacent to the area that’s dead ….begin to diminish and, as a consequence of
    decreased blood supply to areas of the bowel that aren’t twisted but simply
    being deprived of their blood supply, they too may die, and so the length of
    bowel that’s resected may get extended, if you will, in terms of the length of
    the bowel that needs to be resected. </p>

    after this evidence was given, counsel for the appellant objected to a question

    up to what happens in the bowel. Counsel for the respondent responded that the

    not be untwisted because of the toxic products that would be released into the
    circulation system.  Instead, the
    surgeon would try to limit the extent of resection in the region of the

    hour time frame within which he should have acted.  When the respondent’s condition worsened, Dr. Dervish was obliged
    to attend on the respondent and to operate within six to eight hours.  His failure to do so either caused the loss
    of her bowel or aggravated her condition by allowing infection from the bowel
    to spread. At the very least, the appellant’s negligence aggravated the
    respondent’s short bowel syndrome and provides an additional reason for
    dismissing the appeal on the issue of causation.  No substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred within
    the meaning of s. 134 of the <i>Courts of
    Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;C.43.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is one last argument advanced by the appellant that I will briefly address. The
    appellant also submitted that it was scientifically impossible to know when the
    loop or twist in the respondent’s bowel occurred and when it progressed to
    fully strangle her bowel.  Thus, he
    submitted it is impossible for the respondent to prove that but for the
    appellant’s delay in operating she would not be suffering from short bowel
    syndrome.  I have rejected this
    submission for the reasons given above.  If, however, the appellant’s submission was to be accepted, I would hold
    that the requirements of the material contribution test are met. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted in <i>Resurfice Corp. v. Hanke,</i> 2007 SCC 7<i> </i>at para. 25, the two
    requirements for the material contribution test are as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>First, it must
    be impossible for the plaintiff to prove that the defendant’s negligence caused
    the plaintiff’s injury using the “but for” test.  The impossibility must be due to factors that are outside the
    plaintiff’s control; for example, current limits of scientific knowledge.  Second, it must be clear that the defendant
    breached a duty of care owed to the plaintiff, thereby exposing the plaintiff
    to an unreasonable risk of injury, and that the plaintiff must have suffered
    that form of injury.   In other words,
    the plaintiff’s injury must fall within the ambit of the risk created by the
    defendant’s breach.  In those
    exceptional cases where these two requirements are satisfied, liability may be
    imposed, even though the “but for” test is not satisfied, because it would
    offend basic notions of fairness and justice to deny liability by applying a
    “but for” approach.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    example given by the Supreme Court of Canada as to when the material
    contribution test may be applied involved two persons negligently firing guns
    and injuring a third person.  This test
    was applied because it was impossible to determine which of two tortious
    sources caused the injury.  Here, only
    one person was negligent but there are two medical causes for the respondent’s
    condition: a volvulus that caused a portion of the respondent’s bowel to die
    and ensuing infection when timely surgery did not take place. Both of these are
    within the ambit of risk created by the appellant’s negligence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    detection of the respondent’s volvulus was beyond the current limits of
    scientific knowledge before an operation was carried out, the appellant’s delay
    in operating after her condition worsened was a breach of his duty of care
    towards her.  This breach unreasonably
    exposed her to the risk of losing her bowel or to losing more of it than she
    otherwise would have lost.  As such, I
    conclude that the short bowel syndrome from which she suffers is within the
    ambit of the risk that the appellant created. </p>

    rebound tenderness and guarding.  There
    are different types of peritonitis.  Primary acute peritonitis, which is rare, is usually caused by
    blood-borne infection.  Secondary acute
    peritonitis is usually caused by perforations of the gastro-intestinal
    tract.  Therefore, in the case of a
    bowel obstruction, a perforation of any part of the intestinal tract could lead
    to peritonitis.</p>

  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><a href="#_ftnref7"
name="_ftn7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[7]</span></a> Once the
    bowel dies, it will engender an inflammatory reaction leading to the appearance
    of fibrin and liquid in the abdominal cavity.  As the necrotic bowel deteriorates further, it can lead to the contents
    of the bowel leaking into the abdomen.  These are the causes of the peritonitis. </p>

    respondent was first admitted to the hospital her bladder was very full and she
    was in pain.  Dr. Latulippe testified
    that in order to be in a position to conduct an accurate examination it is
    standard to order that the bladder be drained by means of the insertion of a Foley
    catheter and then for the patient to be re-examined to see if the pain and
    sensitivity were attributable to the fullness of her bladder.  The appellant did this and his exam,
    conducted at noon on April 5, reflects the respondent’s resulting improvement.  The nursing note at 11 pm indicates that
    despite the use of a Foley catheter to empty urine from the bladder the abdomen
    was becoming distended and hard.  </p>

<div id=ftn9>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><a href="#_ftnref9"
name="_ftn9" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[9]</span></a> Dr.
    Latulippe spoke of the presence of fibrin clots when peritonitis begins.
    Inferentially, he disagreed with Dr. Axler’s written opinion that the presence
    of fibrin clots was an indication that peritonitis had been present for several
    days and his oral evidence that it meant at least more than one day.  Dr. Dervish explained that when a person has
    an intestinal obstruction there is distension of the bowel proximate to the
    obstruction that becomes congested and can cause an outpouring of plasma from
    the bowel wall into the peritoneal cavity.  This plasma contains fibrin which will deposit on the outside lining of
    the bowel wall and is seen, for example, when there is acute appendicitis or an
    intestinal obstruction (as opposed to peritonitis) that has been there for a
    day or two.  </p>
