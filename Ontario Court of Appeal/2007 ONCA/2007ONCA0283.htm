    land in the Township of Smith – Ennismore – Lakefield near Peterborough.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. and Mrs. Davis mortgaged the two properties to the
    respondent, Household Realty Corporation Limited. The mortgages were registered
    on title on March 6, 2003. On December 19, 2005 Household Realty commenced an
    application in the Superior Court for a declaration that the two mortgages were
    valid and enforceable pursuant to s.&nbsp;50(15) of the <i>Planning Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.P. 13. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 26, 2006 Mr. and Mrs. Davis filed assignments in
    bankruptcy. On the following day, January 27, 2006, counsel for Mr. and Mrs.
    Davis advised counsel for Household Realty that the application was stayed as a
    result of the assignment in bankruptcy and that the trustee in bankruptcy
    should determine how the application was to proceed. Counsel for Household
    Realty disagreed with that position.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for Mr. and Mrs. Davis was advised by the trustee in
    bankruptcy that it was taking no position on the application. The trustee also
    advised counsel for Mr.&nbsp;and Mrs. Davis that he was authorized to proceed
    with the application provided that the trustee in bankruptcy was not exposed to
    any costs order. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On July 14, 2006 the trustee in bankruptcy wrote to counsel
    for Household Realty and advised that he did not oppose the application of
    Household Realty. The trustee further stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Should you be
    successful in your Motion, it will confirm our understanding that your client’s
    mortgages are properly secured against the bankrupt’s property as disclosed on
    their Statement of Affairs. However, in the event that you are unsuccessful in
    your endeavors and your client’s secured claim is deemed to be invalid and thus
    unsecured, we will take all appropriate steps to realize upon the resulting
    equity in the subject property for the benefit of the unsecured creditors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application proceeded before Justice H. R. McLean of the
    Superior Court of Justice on July 20, 2006 in Peterborough. The trustee in
    bankruptcy did not participate although a representative was present in court.
    Justice McLean made the declaration of validity sought by Household Realty. His
    reasons made no mention of the bankrupt status of Mr. and Mrs. Davis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On July 31, 2006 Mr. and Mrs. Davis served a notice of appeal
    to this court. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 6, 2006 Mr. and Mrs. Davis were discharged from

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 17, 2006 the trustee in bankruptcy signed a consent
    in favour of Mr.&nbsp;and Mrs. Davis which read:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Mandelbaum
    Spergel Inc., the Trustee in Bankruptcy of Braden Grant Davis and Gwenyth Jane
    Davis, hereby consents to the Appellants proceeding with the within appeal and

    is not responsible for any costs regarding the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for Household Realty now brings a motion to quash the
    appeal to this court on the ground that Mr. and Mrs. Davis have no standing to
    prosecute the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the return of the motion before us counsel for Household
    Realty conceded that the application in the Superior Court ought not to have
    proceeded against Mr. and Mrs.&nbsp;Davis and that appropriate steps should
    have been taken to add the trustee in bankruptcy in place of Mr. and Mrs. Davis.
    Although counsel did not specifically cite s.&nbsp;69.3(1) of the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency</i>, R.S.C. 1985,
    c. B-3 (the “Act”), we assume that such concession was made in reliance on that
    section and on the assumption that leave is required pursuant to s. 69.4 of the
    Act.  We note that counsel for Household
    Realty in this court did not rely upon s. 69.3(2) of the Act which enables a
    secured creditor to realize on its security without leave of the court,
    although that appears to have been its position prior to proceeding before the
    application judge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although it is not necessary to decide the point on this
    motion, we are of the view that s. 69.3(2) governs the circumstances here and
    that Household Realty was entitled to proceed as it did against Mr. and Mrs. Davis
    without adding the trustee and without seeking leave to continue the
    proceedings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, it is clear that upon the bankruptcy of Mr. and
    Mrs. Davis their interest in the properties immediately vested in the trustee
    in bankruptcy: see s. 71 of the Act. The fact that they are no longer in
    bankruptcy does not change their position in regard to the properties in issue
    here. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for Mr. and Mrs. Davis submits that his clients’
    interest in the two properties is now governed by s. 40(1) of the Act which
    provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>With the
    permission of the inspectors, any property of a bankrupt found incapable of
    realization shall be returned to the bankrupt prior to the trustee’s
    application for discharge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is the submission of counsel that the trustee’s failure to
    take a position on the application of Household Realty and the trustee’s
    consent to Mr. and Mrs. Davis proceeding with the appeal engages s. 40(1) of
    the Act. In support of this argument counsel relies on the judgment of this
    court in <i>Shelson v. Gowling Lafleur
    Henderson LLP et al.</i> (2004), 70 O.R. (3d) 171 (C.A.). We disagree. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In that case the trustee in bankruptcy represented to the
    bankrupt, Dr. Shelson, prior to his assignment in bankruptcy that his interest
    in a civil action would revest in him upon his discharge. During the course of
    the bankruptcy the trustee took no steps in respect of the civil action. After
    his discharge, the bankrupt pursued the action for five years when the trustee,
    who had some years earlier been discharged, asserted an interest in the action
    and purported to offer it for sale. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Deputy Registrar in Bankruptcy made an order requiring the
    trustee to return the interest in the civil action to Dr. Shelson in reliance
    on s. 40(1) of the Act. In doing so, he also relied upon a judgment of the
    Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in <i>Zemlak v.
    Deloitte Haskins and Sells Ltd.</i> (1987), 66 C.B.R. (N.S.) 1. The Deputy
    Registrar asserted that the court in <i>Zemlak</i> had concluded that the trustee on the facts in that case “was obliged to either
    return the non-realizable property under what is now s. 40(1) of [the Act] or
    carry on with the administration of the estate …”. See <i>Shelson</i> at para. 23.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In restoring the Deputy Registrar’s decision, which had been
    reversed by Ground&nbsp;J. of the Superior Court, Catzman J.A., writing for
    this court, said at paras. 29 and 30:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I do not quarrel
    with the result in <i>Zemlak</i> or with the
    Deputy Registrar’s reliance on that case. But, with deference, I am concerned
    with the breadth of the proposition stated by the Deputy Registrar: that when a
    trustee applies for its discharge, it must elect, or be considered to have
    elected, to return to the bankrupt its interest in non-realizable property
    under s. 40(1) of the <i>BIA</i> and, if it
    fails to do so, it holds that interest as trustee for the bankrupt and must
    return that interest to him.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In my view, the
    proposition cannot be framed as a “bright-line” rule that admits of no
    exceptions. Even the court in <i>Zemlak</i> qualified its statement of the proposition by the introductory phrase “[I]n the
    circumstances of this case”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, this court found that the Deputy Registrar’s
    proposition did apply to the facts in <i>Shelson</i>.
    Catzman J.A. referred in particular to the knowledge of the trustee of Dr.
    Shelson’s civil action before his assignment in bankruptcy and the trustee’s
    failure to take any steps with respect to the action until several years after
    the trustee was discharged. Catzman J.A. concluded at para. 31: “[I]t was by
    then far too late for the trustee to come forward and seek to realize on the
    value of its professed interest in the action.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Shelson</i> case is
    distinguishable from the case at bar. In <i>Shelson</i> the trustee abandoned, from the outset, any interest in the civil action. In
    this case the trustee has not abandoned any interest in the Davis properties.
    It has simply taken the position that it believes Household Realty holds valid
    mortgages on the properties and does not wish to expose the estate to costs by
    participating in the litigation. However, the trustee has reserved its right to
    realize on the value of the properties for the benefit of the unsecured
    creditors should Household Realty’s application be unsuccessful. Further, in
    our view, the consent given by the trustee to allow Mr. and Mrs. Davis to
    proceed with the appeal is of no consequence and does not constitute an
    abandonment of whatever interest the trustee may have in the properties. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since the properties remain vested in the trustee, Mr. and
    Mrs. Davis lack status to institute and proceed with the appeal. In the result,
    we have no alternative but to allow the motion to quash the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Household Realty shall have its costs of the motion on a
    partial indemnity basis fixed at $1,500 including disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
