    Ottawa Limited and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local
    636 are parties to a collective agreement.  The
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union filed a policy grievance regarding the use of non-bargaining unit personnel
    to perform bargaining unit work.  The particular dispute in this case involved
    the use of individuals employed by an outside agency in the Hydro Ottawa
    accounting department to perform bargaining unit work in an integrated fashion
    with bargaining unit employees.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    grievance procedure evolved over a series of decisions.  At an early stage
    the Arbitrator had determined that one of the individuals whose working arrangement
    was disputed – Bruno DePasquale – was not an employee of Hydro Ottawa but
    remained an employee of the agency, Accountemps.  Mr. DePasquale is one of
    a number of workers in a similar position at Hydro Ottawa.  When the grievance
    arose, he had been working full time in the Hydro Ottawa accounting department
    under the disputed arrangement from January 2002 to September 5, 2003.  He
    was paid by Accountemps.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union’s grievance states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>Grievance:  Management is in violation of employee, bargaining unit and
    union rights as per the collective agreement and any relevant clauses therein,
    past practices or Legislative rights that apply.  The Local Union grieves
    against the contracting out of work in all departments of Hydro Ottawa and
    affiliated organizations.  The Local Union relies on Article 21 and all other
    relevant provisions of the collective agreement; on the breach of the established
    practice of not eroding the bargaining unit through the use of contractors;
    on the breach of the commitment made during collective bargaining not to
    staff with contractors and temporary employees; on the breach of the established
    practice of not intermingling contractors and employees in the performance
    of their respective duties; on the breach of the established practice of
    consulting with the Local Union when a perceived need for contractors arises;
    and on the breach of the established practice of inviting the Local Union
    to “bid” on work that would otherwise go to contractors.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>Resolution sought:  That Hydro Ottawa and all affiliated organizations
    cease and desist from their use of contractors other than in accordance with
    the collective agreement, established practices, and commitments made to
    the Local Union in collective bargaining.  That the Company be ordered to
    produce to the Local Union an accounting of all work performed by contractors
    subsequent to the date of amalgamation of the local utilities, including
    the dollar value of such contracting, through to and including the date of
    the arbitration decision.  That the Company be ordered to produce to the
    Local Union a monthly accounting following the date of the decision.  That
    the Company remit to the Local Union all union dues in the dollar amounts
    that would have been remitted to the Local Union had the work wrongfully
    contracted out been performed by employees.</p>

    Arbitrator found that the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union’s grievance was “largely a complaint about the performance of bargaining
    unit work by contractors who [were] not part of the bargaining unit” and
    who were not employees of Hydro Ottawa.  He made three awards over the course
    of the grievance procedure.  First, he determined – over objections from
    Hydro Ottawa that the issue went beyond the original issue submitted to him –
    that the Union could argue the question of whether “the persons in dispute
    [were] actually employees of Hydro Ottawa, who should [have been] included
    in the bargaining unit, even though management [was] treating them as if
    they [were] contractors rather than employees.”<b> </b> In a second award,
    dated December 10, 2003, the Arbitrator found that one of the individuals
    in question (Kathryn Keyes) was a true employee of Hydro Ottawa but that
    the other individual (Mr. DePasquale) was not (the “Second Award”).  Finally,
    in a third award – the decision under review here – he concluded that the
    collective agreement prohibited the use of agency workers in the fashion
    under dispute for a period longer than two weeks (the “Third Award”).</p>

    Ottawa sought judicial review of the Third Award.  On that review, the Divisional

    his jurisdiction by, in effect, amending the collective agreement to create
    a third class of employee not contemplated by it
    – namely, a person who is not an employee of Hydro Ottawa but “who is ‘like’ a
    bargaining unit employee”.  Applying the decision of this Court in <i>Lakeport

  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
  <h3><span style='font-style:normal'>A. Did the arbitrator improperly answer
      a question that had not been referred to him for determination?</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Ottawa submits that the Arbitrator improperly assumed jurisdiction over a
    matter not remitted to him by the parties for arbitration, namely, the issue
    of whether the collective agreement <i>implicitly</i> limits or prohibits
    the contracting out of the work in question to agency personnel.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  According to Hydro Ottawa, this “new” issue was
    not put to the Arbitrator by either party, but instead was initiated by the
    Arbitrator himself during argument relating to the Second Award concerning
    whether the relevant workers were employees of Hydro Ottawa or Accountemps.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    arbitrator has no inherent jurisdiction and is limited to determining the
    dispute remitted by the parties in accordance with the language of the collective
    agreement.  Once the grievance is submitted, neither the arbitrator nor one
    of the parties may unilaterally alter the substance or expand the scope of
    the grievance: Donald J.M. Brown and David M. Beatty, <i>Canadian Labour
    Arbitration</i>, 4th ed., looseleaf (Aurora, Ont.: Canada Law Book, 2006)
    at 2:1300 (The Submission to Arbitration), 2:3122 (The Form of the Grievance)
    and 3:2200 (Change of Position) (“Brown &amp; Beatty”).  An arbitrator who
    does so exceeds his or her jurisdiction, and any decision made as a result
    is patently unreasonable.  Hydro
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">

  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Arbitrator concluded that the issue of whether the collective agreement implicitly
    limited or prohibited management’s rights to enter into the impugned working
    arrangement did not fall outside of the scope of the grievance and, therefore,
    that he had jurisdiction to deal with it.  I agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    definitions of “casual employee” and “temporary employee” in Article 6 of
    the collective agreement and the provisions of Article 21 (providing for “contracting
    out”) are particularly relevant to this issue.  These provisions, and other
    terms of the collective agreement, are recited in full later in these reasons,
    at para. 25.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    arbitrator is required to construe the submission to arbitration or the grievance
    in the context of the applicable collective agreement to determine its scope,
    and grievances should be construed liberally to get at the real issue between
    the parties: <i>Blouin Drywall Contractors Ltd. v. United Brotherhood of
    Carpenters and Joiners of America, Local 2486</i> (1975), 8 O.R. (2d) 103
    (C.A.); Brown &amp;
    Beatty,<i> supra</i>, at 2:1300 (The Submission to Arbitration).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    as the Arbitrator noted, the thrust of the complaint in the written grievance
    was that Hydro Ottawa was using outside contractors, rather than its own
    employees, to perform “in house” bargaining unit work.  Although the grievance
    stated that the Union was grieving “against the contracting out of work in
    all departments of Hydro Ottawa and affiliated organizations”, the nature
    of the complaint was broad, referring to breaches of the collective agreement
    through the use of “contractors” (which the Arbitrator concluded was broad
    enough to embrace an employment agency) and relying not just upon Article&nbsp;21
    but also on “all other relevant provisions of the collective agreement”.  As
    the Arbitrator also remarked, there would have been no need for Hydro Ottawa
    to advance its submission that Article 21 permitted it to contract out the
    work if the workers were employed by it.  There would be no contracting out
    in that case.  “As a matter of logic,” he said, “[A]rticle 21 would have
    come into play, as a response to the union’s reliance on [A]rticle 6, only
    if the union had suggested the import of [A]rticle 6 was to restrict contracting
    out”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The “issue” of
    whether Article 6 implicitly limited Hydro Ottawa’s right to utilise non-bargaining
    unit agency workers to do bargaining unit work in the fashion in question
    was not a “new” issue remitted to the grievance procedure, in my view.  Rather,
    it was more in the nature of a legal argument raised by the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Union to support its position on the question sent to arbitration.  It was
    an issue embedded in the broader question which formed the substance of the
    grievance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Article 6 line of reasoning emerged during argument of the Second Award.  The
    Arbitrator deliberately postponed determining it at that stage in order to
    give the parties full opportunity to address the argument at the third stage
    hearing, and the parties took full advantage of that opportunity.  Accordingly,
    no denial of natural justice, in the sense of Hydro Ottawa not being given
    the opportunity to be heard on the point, arises.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am not persuaded, therefore, that in the circumstances of this case the Arbitrator
    erred or exceeded his jurisdiction in addressing and resolving the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union’s argument premised on Article 6 of the collective agreement.  It would
    have been preferable, nonetheless, as I note later in these reasons – and,
    perhaps, fairer to Hydro Ottawa, which did not request the two-stage procedure – if
    the Arbitrator had avoided that procedure and considered the whole issue
    before him, and all of the legal arguments, at the same time.  </p>

    Arbitrator concluded that the collective agreement did not permit Hydro Ottawa
    to utilize the services of Mr. DePasquale, an employee of Accountemps – and
    other workers like him – for more than two weeks.  In short, he found that
    the collective agreement implicitly limited the use of non-bargaining unit
    agency personnel to perform bargaining unit work on a “contracting in” basis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Arbitrator framed the issue as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>The question to be answered is whether the collective agreement
    implicitly restricts the engagement of someone employed by an outside agency
    to perform bargaining unit work, where he or she does such work on Hydro
    Ottawa’s premises, under the supervision of its managers, and using its materials
    and equipment.  This sort of arrangement is aptly described as a “labour-only” contract.<a href="#_ftn4"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    premises, supervision, materials and equipment. [Footnote added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    a reasoning process that encompassed several steps, the Arbitrator answered
    the question he posed in the affirmative.  First, he concluded that his earlier
    decision finding Mr. DePasquale was not an employee of Hydro Ottawa was not
    determinative of the issue, observing that “[t]he question of whether a person
    supplied by an agency is employed by the agency or by its client is logically
    distinct from the question of whether the client’s collective agreement permits
    the individual’s services to be used if he or she is an employee of the agency.”  The “only
    issue at hand”, he went on to say, “[was] whether Hydro Ottawa’s collective
    agreement allowed the use of agency employees.”  On this second point, the
    Arbitrator rejected Hydro Ottawa’s argument that its use of agency personnel
    in the circumstances constituted “contracting out” and that to imply a term
    in the agreement prohibiting the use of agency employees for periods longer
    than two weeks would conflict with the express provisions of Article 21 permitting
    such conduct.  He held that because the nature of the “contracting in” in
    this case did not amount to
    “contracting out”, as that concept is understood in labour relations, Article
    21 did not assist the Company.  The provisions of Article 6 and the wage
    schedule in the collective agreement supported the implication of a term
    restricting the use of outside agency workers to perform bargaining unit
    work, in the circumstances of this case, for a period in excess of two weeks.  </p>

    contrary; he concluded that the impugned arrangement conflicted with the
    collective agreement because the agency worker <i>did not belong</i> to one
    of the agreed upon classes of employees.  Thus, it is not a question of the
    Arbitrator having created a new class of employee not contemplated in the
    collective agreement.  He simply found that the non-bargaining unit worker
    could not be used to do the work in question, for a period of longer than
    two weeks.  As he said at the end of his decision:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    Arbitrator made this finding on the basis that the relevant working arrangement
    did not involve contracting out and that the scheme of the collective agreement – crystallized
    by the definitions in Article 6 and the wage schedules to the agreement – is
    to provide for the requirements of short-term or spot labour to be met through
    the use of casual employees (whose term of engagement is limited to a maximum
    of two weeks, and who are not within the bargaining unit) or temporary employees
    (who are hired for a specified period of time, without the intent of continuous
    employment, but who become members of the bargaining unit if hired for a
    period of two weeks or more).  The Arbitrator concluded that to permit Hydro
    Ottawa to use non-bargaining unit agency employees to do bargaining unit
    work in the impugned fashion would be to undermine the collective bargaining
    relationship by allowing it to circumvent that scheme.</p>
  <h3><span style='font-weight:normal;'>The Implied Term</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    view that the term implied by the Arbitrator conflicts with the express provision
    in Article 21 permitting contracting out is founded on the premise that what  Hydro
    Ottawa did in this case constituted “contracting out”.  This premise has
    both a factual and an interpretive aspect to it.  In both respects, arbitrators
    are entitled to considerable deference in cases of this nature.  Here, the
    Arbitrator concluded that Hydro Ottawa’s use of outside agency workers did
    not constitute contracting out.  His decision in that regard was not patently
    unreasonable, in my view.  I say this for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the Arbitrator found as a fact that Hydro Ottawa’s use of non-bargaining
    unit agency personnel to perform bargaining unit work side by side with bargaining
    unit employees, under the supervision of its own managers and using the same
    equipment and materials supplied by it, did not constitute contracting out.  That
    factual finding was open to him on the record and is entitled to considerable
    deference.  I can see no basis for interfering with it and, for that reason
    alone, Article 21 is of little assistance to Hydro Ottawa in this case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly,
    the Arbitrator took an interpretive approach to the collective agreement
    that was consistent with the body of arbitral decision-making dealing with
    the notions of “contracting out” and “contracting in”.  In spite of a reference
    in some texts – picked up by some arbitrators (including this one in an earlier
    ruling in this grievance proceeding) – to “contracting in” being a subset
    or subcategory of “contracting out”, arbitrators have in fact distinguished
    between the two forms of working arrangements.  The  Arbitrator’s decision
    to do so in this case, then, cannot be said to be patently unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    brief review of the notions of contracting out and contracting in, and their
    treatment in the labour relations context, may be helpful in assessing this
    interpretive approach.</p>
  <h3><span style='font-weight:normal;'>Contracting Out/Contracting In</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Arbitrator’s decision reasonably conforms to the concepts of contracting
    out and contracting in as those concepts have evolved in the labour relations
    field. “Contracting out” is said to involve a situation where “an integral
    function or a whole operation of the business of the employer is assigned
    to an independent contractor”; the work is often done off site and, where
    done at the same location as the bargaining unit employees, usually involves
    work of a different nature even though it is bargaining unit work; the independent
    contractor controls the work, and the employer has “effectively abdicated” the
    work to the outside contractor.  “Contracting in”, on the other hand, involves
    a situation where non-bargaining unit personnel are brought into the workplace
    to work alongside bargaining unit employees, performing the same work as
    those employees, under the same supervision and utilising the same materials
    and equipment provided by the employer; the way in which the bargaining unit
    and non-bargaining unit employees work is “virtually indistinguishable”.  See <i>Re
    St. Jude’s Anglican Home and British Columbia Nurses Union</i> (1996), 53
    L.A.C. (4<sup>th</sup>) 111 at 119-120 (Larson); <i>Re Bristol-Myers Pharmaceutical
    Group and Canadian Automobile Workers, Local 1538</i> (1990), 15 L.A.C. (4<sup>th</sup>)
    210 (Shime); <i>Re Radio Shack and United Steelworkers of America, Local
    6709</i> (1994), 44 L.A.C. (4<sup>th</sup>) 69 (Beck).  These and other arbitral
    decisions all emphasize that contracting in is “inherently destructive of
    the bargaining relationship” and generally contrary to the obligations undertaken
    by the employer in the collective agreement: <i>St. Jude’s, supra</i>, at
    119.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the Arbitrator found that, because the impugned working situation entailed
    the use of non-bargaining unit agency workers to do bargaining unit work
    side by side with bargaining unit employees, subject to the same supervisors
    and utilising the same equipment and materials supplied by Hydro Ottawa – in
    effect, making them indistinguishable from bargaining unit employees – the
    arrangement had more in common with the assignment of bargaining unit work
    to non-unit employees than with a true contracting out.  He recognized there
    was merit to both sides of the argument, but he chose to accept the “contracting
    in” view of the circumstances. </p>

    Ottawa relies heavily, however, on an argument that has its origins in a
    long and established practice in labour relations –
    dating back at least to the arbitration decision of Professor Arthurs in <i>Re
    United Steelworkers of America and Russelsteel Ltd.</i> (1966), 17 L.A.C.
    253 – to the effect that arbitrators will not imply a term prohibiting “contracting
    out” in a collective agreement.  As Arbitrator P.J. Brunner noted in <i>Re
    Kennedy Lodge Nursing Home and Service Employees’ Union, Local 204</i> (1980),
    28 L.A.C. (2d) 388 at 391:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    Ottawa submits further that “contracting in” is merely a subcategory or subset
    of “contracting out” or subcontracting, and has been recognized as such by
    the text writers and in the body of arbitral-decision making that has developed:
    see Brown &amp; Beatty, <i>supra</i>, at 5:1310; Adams, <i>supra</i>, at
    para. 8.260; <i>St. Jude’s, supra; Re Municipal Property Assessment Corp.
    and

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union </i>(2002), 109 L.A.C. (4<sup>th</sup>) 385 at 399 (Howe).  Accordingly,
    Hydro Ottawa contends that Article 21 of the collective agreement governs,
    whatever form the “contracting in” or “subcontracting” takes, and permits
    Hydro Ottawa to use agency employees in the manner at issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are several flaws in this reasoning in my view, however – keeping in mind
    particularly that what is at issue here is whether the decision of the Arbitrator
    was patently unreasonable.  For one thing, there is little support in the
    body of arbitral decision making dealing with contracting in/contracting
    out, or in the legal writing on the subject, to support the view that a similar
    restrictive interpretive approach should be taken to “contracting in” as
    is taken to “contracting out”.  In addition, as noted above, the Arbitrator
    found as a fact that the working arrangement here did not constitute contracting
    out; thus, Article 21 is marginally relevant at best.  Finally, it is evident
    that reasonable people in the labour relations field have held differing
    reasonable views on the contracting out/contracting in issue and, in particular,
    on whether contracting in, by definition, amounts to contracting out.  Accordingly,
    it cannot be said that favouring one view or the other is patently unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
    the fact that there are differing reasonable views held in this area of labour
    relations is illustrated even in relation to the question that is taken to
    be no longer debatable in the arbitration sector in Canada, namely that “unless
    the collective agreement contains a specific prohibition, it is open to management
    to contract out certain aspects of the work or undertaking to persons other
    than employees or members of the union…”: <i>Re 410548 Ontario Ltd., supra</i>,
    at 699.  Much was said in argument about this apparently well-settled view.  I
    observe, however, that the view is not universally accepted in the labour
    relations field.  Labour <i>boards</i> have demonstrated a willingness to
    place contracting out arrangements under considerable scrutiny, particularly
    in relation to bad faith bargaining, unfair labour practices, and successor-employer
    and related-employer issues.  Moreover, <i>arbitrators</i> in the
    <st1:place

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    are prepared to take the same tack.  See, generally, on this point, Morton

    in none of the texts or arbitration decisions in which it is suggested that “contracting
    in” is a subcategory or subset of
    “contracting out” is there any analysis of the factual differences between
    the two concepts or any discussion about whether the same underlying labour
    relations policy considerations should apply to them.  A review of the arbitration
    decisions dealing with the subject reveals that there are factual differences
    between the two types of situations that are significant in terms of the
    collective bargaining relationship.  As well, there are reasons for concluding
    that the same policy considerations do not necessarily apply.  For example,
    while contracting out (which involves the effective abdication of the work
    by the employer to the subcontractor) admittedly impinges upon the bargaining
    unit work that would otherwise be done by union members, it is far less inherently
    destructive of the collective bargaining relationship than contracting in
    (where the work of the two groups is virtually indistinguishable).  Consequently,
    the rationale for protecting management’s general right to control the assignment
    of work may be less compelling in the latter situation than in the former.</p>

    at p. 216, where he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>When all of these factors are analyzed within the context of the instant
    case a number of clear distinctions [between a true contracting out situation
    and a contracting in situation] emerge.  First, as I have indicated <i>this
    is a contracting in situation where persons are assigned work “in house”</i> so
    to speak, which is work normally performed by bargaining unit employees.  The
    persons were <i>intermingled with bargaining unit employees</i> and worked
    under the direction and control of foremen and a lead hand employed by Bristol-Myers.  Secondly, <i>unlike
    the Russelsteel case, this is a contracting in situation in which the assignment
    of work and the way it was performed even absent actual intent are inherently
    destructive of the bargaining relationship and the wage structure under the
    collective agreement.  In my view, it is unlikely that the board in the Russelsteel
    case ever intended its decision to apply to a contracting in situation such
    as exists in the present case.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>

    the parallels between the contracting in situation in <i>Bristol-Myers</i> and
    that in the present case, the Arbitrator cited the foregoing passage with
    approval.  It was not patently unreasonable for him to follow this line of
    analysis.  Other arbitration decisions and commentators have concluded that
    the assignment of work to non-bargaining unit employees in such circumstances
    is not normally thought of as contracting out: see the decisions and commentaries
    collected in Brown &amp; Beatty<i>, supra</i>, at 5:1310, n. 2.  </p>

    Ottawa also argues, however, that the relevant body of arbitral decision
    making – of which <i>St. Jude’s </i>and<i> Bristol-Myers</i> are said to
    be examples – establishes a two-step process in determining whether the employer
    has engaged in contracting out: first, it must be determined who is the non-bargaining
    unit worker’s employer, and secondly, it must be determined whether the collective
    agreement prohibits contracting out (otherwise the <i>Russelsteel</i> principle – permitting
    contracting out in the absence of an express provision to the contrary –
    applies).  If it is determined that the worker is employed by an outside
    agency, and if the collective agreement contains a clause permitting contracting
    out, that is the end of the enquiry: the company is entitled to put the contracting
    out arrangement in place.  In the context of this case, Hydro Ottawa contends,
    the Arbitrator found that Mr. DePasquale was employed by Accountemps and
    not by Hydro Ottawa and, having made that finding, he was compelled to find
    as well that the impugned working arrangement was permitted because of the
    provisions of Article 21.</p>

line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not agree, but there are a number of points arising from that submission
    that need to be canvassed.  First, I do not read either <i>Bristol-Myers</i> or <i>St.
    Jude’s </i>as promoting such a compartmentalized approach.  Rather, I see
    them as calling for a cohesive analysis of the notional employer and the
    contracting in/contracting out problems in the context of the subject working
    arrangement and the provisions of the collective agreement, with a view to
    determining the ultimate question, namely, whether the company has effectively
    contracted out the work in the circumstances.  Secondly, while I can appreciate
    that the apparent disconnect between the Arbitrator’s finding in the Second
    Award (that Mr. DePasquale was not an employee of Hydro Ottawa) and his finding
    in the Award under review (that the impugned working arrangement was not
    permitted by Article 21) may have evoked a certain sense of unfairness in
    Hydro Ottawa about the Arbitrator’s decision, I do not think the decision
    is thereby rendered patently unreasonable.  Finally, as I shall explain,
    even if <i>Bristol-Myers</i> and <i>St. Jude’s</i>, or other arbitral decisions,
    do adopt a different approach than that employed by the Arbitrator, his decision
    is not patently unreasonable simply because he followed a different path
    to arrive at his award, provided the award is not patently unreasonable on
    the record before him.  I turn to these considerations now.</p>

    Ottawa.  It is true that in both cases the arbitrator addressed the question
    of who was the real employer (the agency or the company), but both arbitrators
    concluded that the determination of that matter was not dispositive of the
    contracting in/contracting out issue.  The notional employment consideration
    is itself only a test for determining the ultimate question, which is whether
    the company has successfully contracted out the work in issue.   </p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

      Jude’s</i>, <i>supra</i>, the issue was whether agency nurses who filled
      in from time to time were employed by the agency and not covered by the
      collective agreement, or were employees of the nursing home for purposes
      of that agreement.  Arbitrator Larson noted that there were two divergent
      lines of arbitral decisions relating to the use of agency workers and whether
      they would become subject to the requirements of the relevant collective
      agreements.  He made it clear, however, that in his view the question of
      who was the real or notional employer of the non-bargaining unit workers
      was simply a test to help determine the contracting out issue.   His reasons,
      at pp. 116-17 and 119-120, explain how the “notional employer” and “contracting
      out” versus “contracting in” issues are linked and form the basis for a
      single unified analysis.  He said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In fact, whether
    the collective agreement contains a contracting out clause can never be determinative,
    in such cases, for the simple reason that <i>the real question to be decided
    is whether a true contracting out has occurred in the first place</i>.  That
    is the whole point of the applicability of the various tests, which is to
    say, to determine whether the employer has effectively abdicated that work
    to the employment agency so that one could conclude that the provisions of
    the collective agreement would not apply to it.  <i>If the work has not been
    contracted out, then it follows logically that the collective agreement continues
    to control how it must be done</i>.  Only if it has been properly contracted
    out does the work fall outside of the control of the collective agreement.

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…[w]hat must

    the real substance of the issue in dispute, which is whether the client employer
    has managed to successfully contract out the bargaining unit work done by
    the agency employee</i>.  For that purpose, one looks to see if the agency
    employee is being worked in essentially the same manner as other employees <i>but
    the objective of the test is not to determine who is the real employer in
    those circumstances but rather whether the work has been genuinely contracted
    out</i>.  If the work remains under the control of the client employer or,
    what is the same thing, if the agency employee is required to work in essentially
    the same manner as any other employee of the client employer, one would have
    to conclude that the agency employee is effectively employed by the client
    employer.  More importantly, if one determines that the work remains under
    the control of the client employer such that it has not been contracted out
    to the agency employer, it follows logically that the work remains subject

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    an effective alienation of the work so as to preclude any further application
    of the collective agreement to it must be measured by reference to the various
    tests set out in the cases.  Only where the work is genuinely contracted
    out or is incidental to the work of the bargaining unit, can the employer
    escape the obligation to apply the terms of the collective agreement to it.  But
    is should be obvious that because of the nature of a contracting-in, it will
    be difficult for the employer to meet those tests since, in almost every
    case, that employer will be unable to functionally separate it out of its

    may have led to what Hydro Ottawa views as inconsistent findings in the two
    awards and, thus, to the sense of unfairness referred to above.  While I
    do not view his two findings – that Mr. DePasquale was not an employee of
    Hydro Ottawa, but that the working arrangement under attack, nonetheless,
    did not constitute contracting out – as necessarily incompatible in the determination
    of the ultimate issue, for the reasons I outline, Hydro Ottawa could be forgiven

    adopting a purposive interpretation of the collective agreement, the Arbitrator
    was following one of two distinct approaches taken by arbitrators towards
    collective agreements over the years.  The first is the orthodox contract
    law approach.  The second is the more liberal purposive approach, which recognizes
    that a collective agreement is different from a normal commercial contract
    and that it must be read and construed in the context of the labour relations
    environment in which it was negotiated.  This difference in the approach

    matter of debate that need not be resolved for the purpose of this appeal.  Both
    approaches resort to the traditional markers of contractual interpretation,
    seeking to determine the intention of the parties from the language of the
    agreement in the contextual setting in which it was written.  The differences
    may be in degree – the purposive approach to interpreting a collective agreement
    placing, perhaps, a little more emphasis on the collective bargaining context
    in which the agreement is negotiated than the orthodox approach does on the
    setting of a commercial contract.  These differences are not material in

    Arbitrator considered Hydro Ottawa’s submission that he should be reluctant
    to imply terms into a collective agreement, as other arbitrators have been.  In
    particular, Hydro Ottawa relied upon the decision of Arbitrator Sychuk in <i>Re
    County of Athabasca No. 12 and Alberta Teachers’ Association, Athabasca Local</i> (1978),
    19 L.A.C. (2d) 1.  At pp. 6-7, Arbitrator Sychuk said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>The legal principles governing the implication of a term into
    a contract are very strict and an arbitration board, like the Court, must
    be extremely careful as to how and when it implies a term into a collective
    agreement.  If the term is raised by one of the parties during negotiations,
    but there is no agreement with respect to the same, such a provision cannot
    become an implied term within the legal test discussed in Issue No. 3 hereof.  It
    is only those terms that are not raised during negotiations, but which had
    they been raised during negotiations, both parties would have instantaneously
    expressed their agreement therewith, that are capable of being implied into
    a contract.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    jurisprudence to date does not reflect a trend on the part of arbitrators
    to imply terms into a collective agreement.  It is a fundamental principle
    of law that an implied term cannot conflict with an express provision to
    the contrary.  In view of the fact that most collective bargaining agreements
    contain an express management rights clause which reserves unto the employer
    the management of the operation, except to the extent that the same is expressly
    dealt with in the collective bargaining agreement, it is not surprising that
    arbitrators have not found implied terms on matters on which the collective
    agreement is silent, because such implied terms would in all probability
    be in conflict with the express provision to the contrary in the management

    use of agency workers.  This approach offends neither article 1.2 [Management
    Rights] nor article 2 [Purpose].  The management rights contained in article
    2 may not be exercised in a manner “inconsistent” with other provisions in
    the agreement, including article 6.  I read article 1.2 as saying no more
    than the agreement contains agreed terms and conditions of employment.  This
    article does not preclude the implication of such additional terms as are
    necessary to ensure the express terms are not undermined.</p>

    would I say the Arbitrator’s conclusion that Article 6 implicitly limits
    the use of agency workers contravenes the dictates of Article 10.5.2 precluding
    an arbitrator from adding to or subtracting from or otherwise changing the
    provisions of the collective agreement.  An implied term is a term of the
    contract; it is not an amendment to or modification of the contract.  As
    Arbitrator Larson observed in <i>Re School District No. 57 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Prince George) and United Brotherhood of Carpenters &amp; Joiners, Local

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>The problem with that argument is that it misconceives the nature of an
    implied right.  An implied right is not one that is invented by an arbitrator,
    but rather, is one that arises out of an interpretation of the collective
    agreement.  It is one that is not expressed in absolute terms but that can,
    nevertheless, be inferred by an ordinary and natural reading of the agreement.  Were
    it otherwise, an arbitrator would not be entitled under art. 4.02<a href="#_ftn8"

    meaning was not absolutely clear.</p>

    conclusion, the Arbitrator did not undertake to determine a matter that had
    not been submitted to him for arbitration.  His finding that Hydro Ottawa’s
    assignment of outside agency workers to do the bargaining unit work in question
    did not constitute “contracting out” within the meaning of Article 21 of
    the collective agreement and was subject to an implied term prohibiting the
    use of such workers for periods of more than two weeks – having regard to
    the provisions of Article 6 and the wage schedules in the agreement – was
    not patently unreasonable.  In my respectful view, the
