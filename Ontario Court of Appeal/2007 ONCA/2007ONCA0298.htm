  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>The stated position of the Plaintiffs on these motions is that there
      is a valid and important public purpose in the economic benefit to be delivered
      from the Toyota Plant and they acknowledge that expropriation to permit
      such development can be lawfully and properly achieved under valid provincial
      legislation.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>It does not seem to me that there is any evidence on which (with the
      above admissions) a Court could conclude that the expropriation itself
      or the actions of the Province were in the Plaintiffs’
    words “per se” illegal or without jurisdiction. The Province would be a necessary
    party for the purposes of that determination.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>Absent specific relief to which the Province would of necessity be
      an essential party, the Court would in my view be without jurisdiction
      to grant the relief that the expropriation of the Mall Lands is “per se” illegal.
      To this limited extent summary judgment will issue in favour of the Defendants.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
      they point to the fact that the motion judge based his decision in part
      on his view that, to grant the relief sought, the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    Province of

      respect, I do not think that this is an impediment. The appellants make
      no claim that the Province has acted unlawfully or that any provincial
      legislation is invalid. Nor do they seek a remedy against the Province.
      They simply say that
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Oxford has acted without lawful authority in the ways described. Granting
    relief that says so does not require that the Province be a party to these
    actions.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>They
      then argue that the motion judge erred in finding that there was no evidence
      on which it could be concluded that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Oxford has acted without lawful authority. They say that he erred in concluding
    that, on this basis, the respondents have established that this claim is
    not a genuine issue for trial.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      agree with this submission. In my view, none of the three arguments made
      by the appellants can properly be resolved at this stage of the proceedings.
      I would conclude that the respondents have failed to show that this claim
      is not a genuine issue for trial.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellants’ argument that
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Oxford has conferred an unlawful bonus on
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toyota by expropriating the mall lands in order to turn them over to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toyota at the expropriation price requires evidence that this price is below
    the fair market value of the mall lands. There is much evidence to support
    that assertion, just as there is much evidence the other way. Indeed, the
    motion judge describes this as the most significantly contested factual issue
    between the parties. It will take a trial to determine what the fair market
    value of the mall lands was in the spring of 2005.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It
      should be said that Oxford’s motion was neither put forward nor decided
      as a question of law on an agreed statement of fact: namely that, accepting
      that the actual fair market value of the mall lands exceeds the expropriation
      price, as a matter of fact, as a matter of statutory interpretation, the “fair
      market value” in s. 106(2)(c) of the <i>Municipal Act</i> should be equated
      to the expropriation value as determined under the <i>Expropriations Act</i>.
      Rather, the respondents continue to assert that, as a matter of fact, the
      expropriation price is not below the fair market value of the mall lands.
      As I have said, there is ample evidence on both sides of this factual assertion
      and it cannot be properly disposed of at this stage of the action. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellants’ second argument in support of its claim also cannot be properly
      resolved at this point. Whether the expropriation is unlawful because it
      is for an industrial use contrary to the zoning provided for the mall lands
      by Official Plan Amendment 99 requires an elucidation of the factual circumstances
      surrounding the adoption of the Amendment. Only that will permit its true
      meaning to be determined. There is clearly some evidence from which it
      could be inferred that the Amendment was intended to continue the zoning
      of the mall lands as “Shopping Centre Commercial”. The respondents assert
      the opposite. Which of these prevails would appear to require a trial.
      At the least, it cannot be said that at this point it is not a genuine
      issue for trial.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      reach the same conclusion about the appellants’ third argument, namely
      that
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Oxford has acted in bad faith and the resulting expropriation by-law was
    passed without lawful authority. It cannot be said that there is no evidence
    on which this argument could succeed. For example, the appellants rely on
    their evidence of the discussions that took place between the principal of
    Blandford and the agents of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Oxford as an instance of bad faith. Here too, the trial judge acknowledged
    that the conflicting evidence raised an issue of material fact. This would
    also require a trial. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      therefore conclude that there is at least some evidence supporting each
      of the arguments on which the appellants base their claim that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Oxford has acted without lawful authority in expropriating the mall lands.
    The respondents have thus failed to establish that this claim is not a genuine
    issue for trial.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I

      On appeal, while the appellants were separately represented, they filed
      a single factum and a single set of materials and split the argument. Given
      their success, the appellants are entitled to their costs from the respondents,
      payable on a partial indemnity basis. We have received draft bills of costs
      and having considered them together with the length and general nature
      of this appeal, I would fix those costs at $42,000.00 inclusive of disbursements
      and G.S.T. If the appellants cannot work out a division of these costs
      between themselves, the court may be spoken to.</span></p>
