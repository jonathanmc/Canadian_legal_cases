    appellant was charged in a multiple count indictment with, <i>inter alia</i>,
    kidnapping and sexually assaulting the complainant on April 9, 2003. She
    was his long-time girlfriend. He was also charged with criminally harassing
    her between January 18,  2003, the date she moved out, and April 9, 2003.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    jury found him guilty on these three charges, but acquitted him of one count

    occurred some years earlier in their relationship. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      On
    his conviction appeal, he argues that the trial judge erred in three ways:  a)
    in dismissing his application to introduce evidence of his sexual relationship
    with the complainant between January 18 and April 9, 2003;  b) in instructing
    the jury that they could use evidence of his past discreditable conduct in
    determining his animus or motive with respect to the offences charged; and  c)
    in failing to leave with the jury the defence of honest but mistaken belief
    in consent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      On
    his sentence appeal, he argues that the trial judge both erred in principle

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      For

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    basic facts are as follows. The appellant and the complainant began their
    nine-year relationship when they were in high school. They had two children
    together, one born in 1995 and the second in 2000. They lived together from
    mid-2000 to January 18, 2003, when the complainant moved out. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Between
    that date and April 9, 2003, the complainant testified that the appellant
    tried relentlessly to communicate with her by telephone and e-mail, and by
    appearing unannounced at her apartment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant testified that on April 9, 2003, the appellant confronted her
    in the hallway of her building, forced her into his car, drove her to a field
    and sexually assaulted her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant sought to introduce evidence of his sexual activity with the complainant
    between January 18 and April 9 to show that they continued to have sexual
    relations during that time. The trial judge dismissed his application on
    the basis that the appellant had not met the requirements set out in the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. The appellant challenges this ruling as his
    first ground of appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the trial of a sexual assault charge, the admissibility of evidence that
    the complainant has engaged in sexual activity other than that which forms
    the subject matter of the charge is regulated by s. 276(2) of the <i>Code</i>.
    It provides that such evidence is inadmissible unless the court determines
    that the evidence </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>            (a) is of specific instances of sexual activity; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>            (b) is relevant to an issue at trial; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>            (c) has significant probative value that is not substantially outweighed
    by the   danger of prejudice to the proper administration of justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    procedure to be followed by an accused in seeking admissibility of such evidence
    is set out in ss. 276.1 and  276.2 of the <i>Code</i>. Section 276.1(2) requires
    that the accused make an application in writing, setting out detailed particulars
    of the proposed evidence and its relevance to an issue at trial. Section
    276.1(4) then says this:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(4)       Where
    the judge, provincial court judge or justice is satisfied</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>(a)       that
    the application was made in accordance with subsection (2),</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>(b)       that
    a copy of the application was given to the prosecutor and to the clerk of
    the court at least seven days previously, or such shorter interval as the
    judge, provincial court judge or justice may allow where the interests of
    justice so require, and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>(c)       that
    the evidence sought to be adduced is capable of being admissible under subsection
    276(2),</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>the judge, provincial
    court judge or justice shall grant the application and hold a hearing under
    section 276.2 to determine whether the evidence is admissible under subsection
    276(2).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, defence counsel made no written application and only alerted the
    Crown to his intention at the opening of trial. When the trial judge gave
    him overnight to prepare the necessary materials for the application, counsel
    indicated that he was making oral application only, and would not be providing
    any written materials. He confirmed this the next day. The trial judge then
    pressed him for exactly what evidence he proposed to elicit and was advised
    that it would simply be that between the time that the complainant left the
    appellant in January and the alleged sexual assault in April, they had sexual
    relations. As counsel put it,
    It will just be a general question as to whether they made love after their
    separation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge dismissed the appellants application, finding that there were
    no written materials and no evidence in support of the appellants request,
    and that there was no discretion to waive either requirement. The appellant
    challenges these conclusions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not find it necessary to determine whether the failure to make a written
    application must always be fatal, even if the substantive requirements of
    notice and particulars are otherwise met. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart
    from the absence of written materials, here there were no particulars whatsoever
    offered, and no notice was provided of any basis upon which it could be argued
    that the application should succeed. Thus, in my view, the trial judge was
    quite correct to dismiss the appellants application. He was shown no reason
    to allow it. The appellant offered nothing  either in writing or orally  to
    demonstrate that the evidence sought to be adduced was capable of being admissible
    under s. 276(2) of the <i>Code</i>. The description of the proposed evidence
    that was given was not of specific instances of sexual activity. This made
    it clearly inadmissible. There was simply no basis upon which the trial judge
    could have granted the application and gone on to the hearing contemplated
    by s. 276.2.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants second ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred in instructing
    the jury on the positive use they could make of the evidence about the appellants
    prior discreditable conduct. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    background to this issue begins with the Crowns application to have the
    evidence of discreditable conduct admitted. In allowing the application the
    trial judge said this:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The Crown proposes
    to introduce evidence of the history of the relationship of [P.S.] and [M.
    D.]. To summarize, the proposed evidence, if believed, will provide evidence
    of a long-term pattern of [P.S.s] abusive and controlling behaviour towards
    [M. D.]. The alleged abusive behaviour is physical, verbal and psychological.
    This prior discreditable conduct evidence would put the evidence supporting
    the charges in the context of the overall relationship of [P.S.] and [M.
    D.]. As such, the evidence would enable the jury to better evaluate the evidence
    regarding the specific charges. Therefore, I find the proposed evidence relevant
    for the purpose of making the jury aware of the contextual nature of the
    relationship during which the alleged events occurred and following which
    the alleged events occurred.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I also agree
    with the Crowns submissions and I find that the proposed discreditable conduct
    evidence, if believed, is relevant for the purpose of demonstrating the motive
    or animus of [P.S.] with respect to the alleged defences. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then found the probative value of this evidence exceeded its
    prejudicial effect and therefore admitted it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    this ruling, but before the Crown called any evidence, the trial judge cautioned
    the jury that they were not to use this evidence to conclude that the appellant
    is a person of bad character and therefore likely to have committed the offences
    at issue, nor were they to punish him for that conduct by convicting him
    of these offences. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown then elicited from the complainant the evidence of the appellants
    discreditable conduct towards her throughout their relationship. She testified
    to his bullying and general controlling behaviour, with his episodes of anger
    being followed by his promises to change. She also gave evidence of a series
    of specific incidents in which he vented his anger at her, attempted to physically
    control what she did, and assaulted her. Two of these incidents were the
    subjects of separate counts in the indictment, of which the appellant was
    ultimately acquitted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the end of the trial, the trial judge reviewed with counsel his proposed
    instruction with respect to this evidence. Defence counsel indicated he was
    content with it. The trial judge then charged the jury as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>You heard evidence
    of the history of the relationship of [M. D.] and [P.S.] including evidence
    of specific incidents that are not the subject of charges in the indictment.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Prior to making
    any use of any of this type of evidence, you must first be satisfied that
    some or all of that conduct and those acts of [P.S.] did occur.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>You may use
    that evidence which you accept as having occurred, to assist you to understand
    the relationship of [P.S.] and [M. D.]. You may also use such accepted evidence
    to help you determine the animus, that is, the hostility or ill feeling of
    [P.S.] or the motive of [P.S.] with respect to the crimes charged.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>If you conclude
    that some or all of those alleged acts and conduct of [P.S.] did occur in
    the past, you must not use the evidence of that conduct and those acts to
    conclude that [P.S.] is a person of general bad character who, because of
    that general bad character, likely committed the offences that are the subject
    of this trial.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>If you conclude
    that some or all of those alleged conduct and acts of [P.S.] did occur in
    the past, you must not punish [P.S.] for that conduct and those acts by finding
    him guilty of the offences that are the subject of this trial, simply because
    he did those other things in the past.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Like all other
    evidence given by witnesses, it is for you to decide whether or how much
    you will believe of, and rely upon this evidence in reaching your decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant does not contest the ruling that the discreditable conduct evidence
    was admissible. He acknowledges that the evidence was relevant for the purpose
    of providing the jury, provided that they accepted the evidence, with the
    contextual narrative of his relationship with the complainant within which
    the alleged events occurred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the appellant argues that the prior discreditable conduct did not show a
    motive or propensity to commit the very acts in question, namely kidnapping
    and sexual assault. He says that the prior conduct fell short of this and
    therefore the trial judge erred in instructing the jury that they could use
    the evidence, if they accepted it, to assist in determining the appellants
    motive with respect to the offences charged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant says that because the evidence of discreditable conduct did not
    include prior instances of kidnapping and sexual assault, it does not suggest
    a strong disposition to do the very acts alleged and cannot therefore constitute
    evidence that he had the disposition to do the acts on the occasion in issue.
    In this he relies on <i>R. v. Batte</i> (2000), 145 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    broad question here is whether the evidence of the appellants prior conduct
    is sufficiently probative of his animus or motive in committing the offences
    charged to outweigh its prejudicial effect. In the circumstances of this
    case, I would answer this question in the affirmative, and find that the
    trial judge did not err in instructing the jury that they could use the evidence
    for that purpose.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no doubt that the probative force of this kind of evidence is derived
    through propensity reasoning. As explained by Doherty J.A. in <i>Batte</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at para. 97, one infers from the prior conduct that the accused has a certain
    disposition, and one then infers from this disposition that the accused acted
    in a certain way on the occasion in issue. If these inferences are tenuous,
    as is often the case, the risk is that the accused may be found to have done
    the acts in question simply because he is a bad person or because the jury

    risk of prejudicial effect explains what Doherty J.A. described as the criminal
    laws resistance to propensity reasoning. However, as he said, that reticence
    is not absolute if the evidence of discreditable conduct permits a sufficiently
    focused form of propensity reasoning, such that its probative force outweighs
    its prejudicial effect. He put it this way in <i>Batte</i>, at para. 102:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[102]   The
    criminal laws resistance to propensity reasoning is not, however, absolute.
    There will be situations in which the probative force of propensity reasoning
    is so strong that it overcomes the potential prejudice and cannot be ignored
    if the truth of the allegation is to be determined. The probative force of
    propensity reasoning reaches that level where the evidence, if accepted,
    suggests a strong disposition to do the very act alleged in the indictment.
    For example, if an accused is charged with assaulting his wife, evidence
    that the accused beat his wife on a regular basis throughout their long marriage
    would be admissible. Evidence of the prior beatings does much more than suggest
    that the accused is a bad person or that the accused has a general disposition
    to act violently and commit assaults. The evidence suggests a strong disposition
    to do the very act in issue  assault his wife. In such cases, the jury is
    permitted to reason, assuming it accepts the evidence of the prior assaults,
    that the accused was disposed to act violently towards his wife and that
    he had that disposition on the occasion in issue. The existence of the disposition
    is a piece of circumstantial evidence that may be considered in deciding
    whether the accused committed the alleged assault.</p>

      v. F. (D.S.)</i> (1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place

    ), is perhaps the leading example. There, the accused was charged with a
    variety of offences against his wife, including assault, sexual assault,
    and unlawful confinement. The evidence of the appellants prior discreditable
    conduct came from his wife, the complainant, in her description of their
    relationship leading up to the events that resulted in the charges. This
    court summarized that evidence as follows, at paras. 14 and 15:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[14]     In
    this regard, the complainant testified that shortly after the marriage, the
    appellant started calling her names and using abusive language. Within the
    first few months of the marriage, he began to push and shove her and sometimes
    hit her. After the incident with the knife in November 1993, the appellants
    conduct became worse; the appellant would punch, slap and kick her at least
    once a week. The complainant also testified that although the couple had
    consensual sexual relations throughout the marriage, on many occasions the
    appellant had sexual intercourse with her without her consent.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[15]     Further,
    the complainant described the appellant as a very controlling person in dealing
    with the couples financial and social arrangements and also as a person
    who frequently became angry. She testified that as a result she was frightened
    of the appellant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court then went on to find this evidence relevant for the purpose of setting
    out the contextual narrative in the course of which the alleged events occurred,
    and necessary to avoid leaving the jury with an incomplete and possibly misleading
    impression of the relationship. It then went on to describe the probative
    value of the evidence on the issue of the appellants motive saying this,
    at para. 25:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[25]     In
    this case, the evidence, which in general terms described a pattern of abusive
    behaviour towards the complainant, if accepted, was capable of assisting
    the jury in understanding why the appellant did what was alleged in the indictment.
    This evidence demonstrated an animus on the appellants part towards the
    complainant that was consistent with the offences with which he was charged.
    The trial judge was correct in holding that the impugned evidence was relevant
    for this purpose. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court thus concluded that the probative value of the discreditable conduct
    evidence was high. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    then went on to consider a number of factors that reduced the potential prejudicial
    effect of the evidence. Three stood out. First, the high probative value
    of the evidence tended to make it less likely that the evidence would be
    used improperly to convict the appellant because he was a bad person. Second,
    the evidence was entirely that of the complainant, and if her evidence about
    the charges themselves was not accepted, it was unlikely that the jury would
    be greatly swayed by the additional evidence of discreditable conduct. And
    finally, the trial judge gave a clear limiting instruction on the purpose
    for which the jury could use the evidence, and how they could not use it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the end, this court concluded that the probative value of this evidence outweighed
    its prejudicial effect and that it was properly admissible. It could clearly
    be used by the jury for the purposes for which it was highly relevant, including
    the appellants animus or motive to commit the offences charged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, this case is very similar to <i>F.(D.S</i>.<i>)</i>. As in <i>F.(D.S.)</i>,
    here the evidence of the appellants prior discreditable conduct comes from
    the complainant herself. It consists of her general description of their
    long-term domestic relationship, the appellants attitude and behaviour towards
    her and a number of particular incidents of his abuse of her. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    accepted, this evidence is not only useful to paint the complete picture
    of the relationship within which the alleged offences occurred, as the appellant
    concedes. As well, by describing his animus towards the complainant, this
    evidence also assists the jury in determining whether the appellant did what
    was alleged in the indictment. In both respects, its probative value is high.
    In the language of Doherty J.A. in <i>Batte</i>, <i>supra</i>, it is not
    just evidence of a general disposition to act violently. Rather, it is
    evidence that grounds a more probative form of propensity reasoning, namely
    it suggests a strong disposition to do the very acts alleged in the indictment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary
    to the appellants submission, to reach this level of probative force, the
    prior discreditable conduct need not consist of precisely the same kind of
    acts that are alleged in the offences being tried. While this would be an
    important factor in assessing the probative value of such evidence, it is
    not a prerequisite for its admissibility or its use by the jury. What is
    critical is that the evidence suggests not just a general disposition but
    a strong disposition to do the very acts alleged. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, I have no doubt that the evidence meets that standard. It outlines
    the stormy long-term domestic relationship between this appellant and this
    complainant. It describes his highly controlling attitude and his abusive
    behaviour towards her. While it is true that none of the specific incidents
    testified to by the complainant include kidnapping or a sexual assault, they
    demonstrate his propensity to physically control and assault her in most
    degrading ways. Importantly, the offences alleged against the appellant involve
    the same victim and arise out of the same long-term domestic relationship
    as the prior disreputable acts. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    controlling attitude of the appellant towards the complainant and his degrading
    and assaultive treatment of her reflected in the evidence of prior conduct
    are highly probative of a strong animus to do the very acts alleged against
    him. If accepted, the evidence has significant probative value in providing
    an understanding of the relationship between the appellant and the complainant,
    and in elucidating his animus or motive to do what was alleged against him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning
    to the potential prejudicial effect of this evidence, the same factors that
    existed in <i>F.(D.S.)</i>, <i>supra</i>, are present in this case. The high
    probative value of the evidence tends to make it less likely that it would
    have been used improperly. It is evidence given entirely by the complainant,
    and if the jury did not accept her evidence about the charges themselves,
    it is unlikely that they would be greatly swayed by her additional evidence
    of his prior disreputable conduct. Finally, the trial judge carefully cautioned
    the jury that they must accept the evidence before using it at all, and that
    then they must not use it to conclude that the appellant is a person of general
    bad character and therefore likely to have committed the offences. Nor were
    they to punish the appellant for the prior acts by finding him guilty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary, I conclude that the evidence of prior discreditable conduct was
    admissible and properly used by the jury as the trial judge instructed. In
    particular, the trial judge did not err in charging that they could use the
    evidence they accepted to help determine the motive of the appellant with
    respect to the offences charged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    disagree. In the circumstances of this case there was no air of reality to
    it. The position taken by the appellant at trial was that the complainant
    not only consented to the sexual activity on April 9, 2003, but was an active
    and willing participant. Conversely, the complainants evidence was that
    she forcefully resisted the appellants advances throughout. A version of
    events that reflected no consent by the complainant and an honest mistake
    by the appellant simply had no air of reality in the evidence. Indeed, counsel
    agreed as much in the pre-trial conference. The issue was purely one of credibility  consent
    or no consent.</p>

line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    argues that the trial judge erred in principle in finding that the complainants
    nine-year relationship with the appellant was characterized by the latters
    controlling and abusive behaviour when the jury had acquitted the appellant
    of two historical assaults alleged to have taken place earlier in the nine-year
    period.</p>

line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the finding was not at odds with these two acquittals. There was
    abundant evidence that throughout the relationship entirely apart from the
    two alleged incidents, the appellant abused the complainant and sought to
    control her. There is no error in principle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant says that the trial judge also erred in overemphasizing denunciation

    sentence.</p>

line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not agree. This court has made clear that crimes of domestic violence
    warrant giving paramount importance to denunciation and both general and
    specific deterrence.  This is so even where the offender has not previously
    been to the penitentiary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    the appellant says that the sentence imposed is outside the appropriate range
    for this sort of offence. Again, I do not agree. The appellant was convicted
    of three very serious offences in the context of the breakdown of a long-term
    domestic relationship. The kidnapping took place on the doorstep of her home.
    The sexual assault was serious, degrading and dehumanizing. The events left
    deep emotional scars on the complainant. The sentence was not unfit.</p>
