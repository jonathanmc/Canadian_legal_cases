  <h2>I.          Introduction</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    litigation arises from loan arrangements entered into by the appellants,
    Freedom Studios Inc. (“FSI”) and Aaron Goldman (“Goldman”), with the respondent,
    the Royal Bank of Canada (the “Bank”), in the summer of 1997 whereby the
    Bank financed, in part, the appellants’ acquisition of property in the City
    of Toronto from which Goldman intended to operate a special effects production
    company.  FSI was incorporated by Goldman for that purpose.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    discussions between Goldman and the respondent Patrick Devine (“Devine”),
    an employee of the Bank, the Bank agreed to provide a one-year term loan
    in the amount of $504,000 to finance the acquisition of the property in question.  The
    loan was secured by a mortgage on the property, a general security agreement,
    $65,000 in cash pledged through a guaranteed investment certificate (the “GIC”),
    and personal guarantees signed by Goldman, his father (David Goldman), his
    mother (Janice Goldman), and his business partner (Sandra Caryl) (collectively,
    the “Credit Facility”).  The funds were advanced to FSI at the beginning
    of August 1997.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants claim that when the Credit Facility was negotiated, Devine indicated
    that within three months of the signing of the mortgage: he would release
    the GIC if rentals for the purchased building were in hand; he would obtain
    a $250,000 government guaranteed small business loan for the ongoing operations
    of the production company; he would provide funds up to the amount of $200,000
    for renovations to the building: and, he would provide equipment financing,
    in an amount up to two million dollars, on certain conditions.  The appellants
    say that, in reliance on these assurances, they rejected available – and
    more favourable
    – alternative financing and entered into the Credit Facility arrangements.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants further maintain that Devine’s statements, and subsequent state-ments
    by the other individual respondents –
    who are also Bank employees – constituted a binding agreement on behalf of
    the Bank to provide additional financing to the appellants and to release
    the funds secured by the GIC on the terms discussed with Devine, which agreements
    the Bank wrongfully breached when it declined to release the GIC funds in
    full and to advance further loans.  In the alternative, the appellants say
    that the statements at issue constitute actionable negligent misrepresentations.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    the appellants sued the Bank and the named Bank employees for damages allegedly
    arising from breach of contract or negligent misrepresentation, the respondents
    moved for summary judgment.  The motion judge concluded that the appellants’ claims
    did not give rise to a genuine issue for trial.  Accordingly, by judgment
    dated August 4, 2006, he granted summary judgment in favour of the respondents
    and dismissed the appellants’ action.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>FSI
    and Goldman appeal that decision.  They make four main submissions in support
    of their assertion that the motion judge erred by concluding that their claims
    against the respondents had no “air of reality” and raised no genuine issue
    for trial.  They submit that the motion judge erred:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>in
    several respects, by dismissing their contract claims;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>in
    his application of the parol evidence rule;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>in
    his assessment of their negligent misrepresentation claims; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>in
    failing to hold that a trial is necessary in this case to permit findings
    to be made on contested facts. </p>
  <h2>II.        Discussion</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the following reasons, we reject these submissions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the motion judge’s reasons indicate that, in determining to grant the respondents’ motion,
    he considered both the documentary record before him and the evidence of
    those persons cross-examined in respect of the motion, including Goldman’s
    testimony, the testimony of his father, mother and cousin, and the testimony
    of Caryl, Goldman’s business partner.  We agree with the motion judge that
    this evidence estab-lished that the appellants failed to meet their onus
    on the summary judgment motion of “lead[ing] trump or risk[ing] losing”:
    see <i>Dawson v. Rexcraft Storage &amp; Warehouse Inc.</i> (1998), 26 C.P.C.
    (4th) 1 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    particular, the appellants failed to produce key documentation alleged by
    them to exist and to be supportive of both their contract and their negligent
    misrepresentation claims.  This “missing” documentation included: (i) the
    alternate offer of financing that the appellants claimed had been received
    by them and which they alleged that Devine had improperly induced them to
    reject; (ii) a critical e-mail from the respondent John Noronha, which the
    appellants relied upon to establish their claim that Noronha agreed or represented
    that he would release the GIC monies to them when demanded and, further,
    that the Bank would renew the mortgage on the property in question when the
    Credit Facility, including the mortgage, came due in 1999; (iii) notes of
    Goldman’s father, David Goldman, that Mr. Goldman Sr. claimed he had made
    regarding the alleged statements of the Bank’s employees; and (iv) an application
    for renovation financing that Goldman testified was submitted to the Bank.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants failed to produce this documentation notwithstanding a request
    by the Bank’s solicitors in August 1999 that evidence of Devine’s alleged
    commitment to further financing be furnished to the Bank and notwithstanding
    a subsequent demand by the respondents, delivered under the <i>Rules of Civil
    Procedure</i>, to inspect documents.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the appellants were also unable or unwilling to provide particulars of the
    additional financing and loan terms that they said had been agreed upon or
    promised by or on behalf of the Bank.  The transcripts from the cross-examinations
    of the deponents of the affidavits filed on behalf of the appellants demonstrate
    their lack of knowledge of the alleged additional financing arrangements
    and, in the case of Goldman, a lack of particularity and precision concerning
    the terms of the proposed financing said by him to have been agreed upon.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    and importantly, the transcripts indicate an awareness by Goldman and Caryl
    that formal financing applications and loan agreements were necessary for
    any additional financing by the Bank beyond that advanced under the mortgage
    granted in 1997.  The record clearly indicates that Goldman and Caryl knew
    that any further loans from the Bank after the summer of 1997 depended on
    additional formal loan applications and, as Caryl put it, “the approval of
    the Bank”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> Fourth,
    it is also significant that when the appellants applied to the Bank in 1998
    to increase the amount and term of the original mortgage on the property,
    there was no suggestion that Bank employees had already committed to, or
    represented that the Bank would provide, additional financing or that the
    Bank was wrongfully retaining the funds then remaining on the GIC security.  This
    application was signed by Goldman.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fifth,
    we do not agree with the appellants’
    submission that the motion judge erred by over-emphasizing the quantum of
    the damages claimed by the appellants in their amended pleading. The compensatory
    relief sought by the appellants was one factor, among many, relevant to an
    assessment of whether the appellants’ claims gave rise to a <i>genuine</i> issue
    for trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sixth,
    we also do not accept that the motion judge mischaracterized the nature of
    the appellants’ breach of contract claims.
     The motion judge’s reasons indicate that he was alive to the various aspects
    of the appellants’ contract claims, including their assertions that one or
    more of the respondents committed to additional financing for renovations,
    operating expenses and the acquisition of equipment.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Seventh,
    we also reject the appellants’ argument that the motion judge erred in his
    application of the parol evidence rule.  The motion judge correctly stated
    the rule, as expressed in accepted authorities, and concluded that:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[16]     The plaintiffs in the present case have
    led no evidence to put themselves or any of them among them within the exceptions
    to the rule.  Simply put, they have simply asserted, if believed, a parallel
    and competing contract, contradictory of the unambiguous written contract
    on which the moving parties rely.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    agree.  The terms of the Credit Facility documents are clear and unambiguous.  As
    we have said, one of the central components of the collateral agreement alleged
    by the appellants was a commitment by Devine to release the GIC within three
    months of the original mortgage financing if certain tenancy requirements
    were met.  But the terms of the Credit Facility documents executed by the
    appellants, in respect of which they had legal advice, specifically provide
    that the GIC would not be released until the funds owed to the Bank were
    repaid.  Thus, in at least this important respect, the collateral agreement
    alleged by the appellants conflicts with and contradicts the terms of the
    written contracts between the parties.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Eighth,
    we also reject the appellants’
    submission that the motion judge erred in his assessment of their negligent
    misrepresentation claims.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge stated, <i>“[A]s a general proposition</i>, an action predicated
    on negligent representation must be a representation in respect of a past
    or presently existing fact and not in respect of a future event.”  [Citations
    omitted and emphasis added.]  By this statement, the motion judge recognized
    that there may be circumstances where a statement about future events could
    arguably ground a negligent misrepresentation claim, where it is based on
    existing facts.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    decision in <i>Premium Properties Ltd. v. Colonia Life Holdings Ltd.</i>,
    [2004] O.J. No. 1785 (S.C.) does not assist the appellants with respect to
    this issue.  In that case, the motion judge was unable to determine the precise
    nature of the alleged represen-tations.  That is not this case.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    again emphasize that the appellants failed to produce documents vital to
    their negligent misrepresentation claims.  These included the alleged third
    party financing commitment, which they claimed to have rejected based on
    Devine’s representations, and the e-mail relied upon by the appellants as
    establishing a written misrepresentation by Noronha.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    the appellants’ contention that the respondents Chin Sang, Gualbance and
    Noronha agreed or represented, at various times, to release the remainder
    of the GIC funds and/or to renew the appellants’ mortgage, rest solely on
    bald assertions by the appellants.  No particulars or documentary support
    for these allegations was proffered by the appellants.  We agree with the
    respondents that in the absence of some arguable legal obligation by the
    Bank to release the GIC prior to the repayment of its loans notwithstanding
    the clear contrary language of the Credit Facility documents, these allegations
    do not give rise to a genuine issue for trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    we are not satisfied that a trial is required in this case for the purpose
    of the determination of contested facts.  On this record, there is simply
    no meaningful support for the representations or the additional financing
    arrangements alleged by the appellants, other than unsubstantiated and bald
    assertions.  These fall far short of any demonstration of real credibility
    issues, or other genuine issues necessitating a trial.  Self-serving evidence
    that merely asserts a defence or a claim without providing some detail or
    supporting evidence is not sufficient to create a genuine issue for trial:
    see <i>Rozin v. Ilitchev </i>(2003), 66 O.R. (3d) 410 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at para. 8.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span

    conclude with this observation.  The appellants advance various claims against
    the individual respondents.  But there is nothing on this record to suggest
    that any of the individual respondents acted outside the scope of their employment
    with the Bank or in their personal capacities in their dealings with the
    appellants.  Accordingly, we are not persuaded that there is any genuine
    issue for trial concerning the claims against these parties.</p>

    conclude that, on this record, it was open to the motion judge to find that
    there was no genuine issue for trial.  The appeal is dismissed.  The respondents
    are entitled to their costs of the appeal on a partial indemnity basis, fixed
    in the total amount of $13,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
