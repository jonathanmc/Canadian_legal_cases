    to the release of the court's reasons for judgment on December&nbsp;21,&nbsp;2006,
    the appellant, the Royal Bank of Canada (<span style='"Times New Roman"'>“</span>RBC”),
    petitioned the court to address an unclarified issue in respect to the costs
    order of the court.  In allowing RBC's appeals and dismissing the cross&#8209;appeals
    of  Soci<span style='"Times New Roman"'>é</span>t<span

    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ) (“SoGen”) and CitiCapital Limited (“CitiCap”), at para. 56 the court made
    the following order:<u></u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>For all of the above reasons, I would allow RBC’s
    appeal and dismiss the cross&#8209;appeals of SoGen, CitiCap and BMO, set
    aside the judgment of the motion judge, substitute a judgment dismissing
    all of the motions for summary judgment and order that RBC’s entire action
    proceed to trial.  I would award RBC its costs of the motions.  Failing agreement
    by the parties on the amount of costs, I would order that they be assessed.  RBC
    is to have its costs of the appeal on a partial indemnity basis fixed in
    the amount of $85,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    unclarified costs issue arose in relation to the motions for leave to appeal
    to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    Divisional Court brought by SoGen and CitiCap from Ground&nbsp;J.'s dismissal
    of certain parts of their motions for summary judgment.  On granting leave
    to appeal, Swinton&nbsp;J. left the costs of the motions to be determined
    by the panel hearing the appeal.  The
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    Divisional Court appeal was subsequently transferred to this court to be
    heard with RBC's appeal as cross&#8209;appeals.  The issue on which RBC has
    sought clarification is whether the costs award of $85,000 includes the costs
    of the motions for leave to appeal.<u></u></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the conclusion of the argument of the appeal, one of the costs outlines that
    RBC filed with the court was in respect to the costs of the motions for leave
    to appeal.  SoGen and CitiCap submit that the panel must, therefore, have
    taken those costs into account in fixing the costs of the appeal at $85,000.  However,
    through inadvertence, the panel failed to do so.  Therefore, it is appropriate
    that we deal with the costs of the leave to appeal motions at this time.<u></u></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>RBC
    has asked for costs and disbursements of approximately $65,000 in respect
    to SoGen's motion for leave to appeal, and approximately $33,000, in respect
    to CitiCap's motion.  As we understand their position, SoGen and CitiCap
    contend that if the court did not include the costs of their leave to appeal
    motions in its award of $85,000, the amounts claimed by RBC are excessive.  They
    do not say that RBC was not entitled to its costs of the motions.  We agree
    that the amounts claimed are excessive.<u></u></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    do not agree with RBC's contention that once it served its notice of appeal,
    by virtue of rule 61.07 of the <span
class=Italics>Rules of Civil Procedure</span> there was no need for SoGen and
    CitiCap to obtain leave to cross&#8209;appeal and, therefore, the motions
    were unnecessary and should have been abandoned.  In our view, the rule applies
    only where the appeal and the cross&#8209;appeal are to the same court.  Here
    RBC's appeal was to the Court of Appeal, whereas the appeals of SoGen and
    CitiCap were to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    Divisional Court with leave.  SoGen and CitiCap had no direct route of appeal
    to this court even with leave.  It was only after leave to appeal had been
    granted by the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    Divisional Court that they could move, as they did, pursuant to s.&nbsp;6(2)
    of the <span class=Italics>Courts of Justice Act</span>, R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;C.43
    to combine the appeals in this court.  It is for this reason that <span
class=Italics>Sigesmund v. The Royal College Dental Surgeons of Ontario</span> (2006),
    81 O.R. (3d) 659 (C.A.), relied on by RBC, has no application to the circumstances
    of this case.<u></u></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    would fix the costs of the motions for leave to appeal as follows:  SoGen's
    motion <span
style='"Times New Roman"'>–</span> $22,000 inclusive of disbursements and GST;
    CitiCap's motion <span style='"Times New Roman"'>–</span> $12,000 inclusive
    of disbursements and GST.<u></u></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    receiving the court's permission to make submissions limited to the costs
    of the leave to appeal motions, RBC included in its submissions to the panel
    a request that the court should also determine the scale applicable to the
    costs of the summary judgment motions before Ground&nbsp;J.  We agree with
    SoGen and CitiCap that the court should not deal with this issue as RBC was
    not given permission by the court to present it for the court's determination.  Moreover,
    at a case conference before Ground&nbsp;J. on February 14, 2007, all parties
    agreed that Ground&nbsp;J. should determine the scale of costs of the summary
    judgment motions and he fixed a date for doing so.  In this regard, para.&nbsp;7
    of Ground&nbsp;J.'s order of February&nbsp;14,&nbsp;2007 states:<u></u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>7.         Assessment of costs of summary judgment
    motions to be scheduled before an Assessment Officer; motion to fix scale
    of costs returnable March 16, 2007 [before Ground&nbsp;J.] <span
style='"Times New Roman"'>–</span> one hour.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    we would fix the costs of the motions for leave to appeal as indicated.  However,
    we decline to consider RBC's request that the panel should determine the
    scale of costs of the summary judgment motions.</p>
