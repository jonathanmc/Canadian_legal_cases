  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant applied to increase the respondent’s obligation to pay child support
    from $117 monthly to $2,300 monthly by imputing income under s. 19(1) of
    the <i>Child Support Guidelines</i>, O.Reg. 391/97 based on the respondent’s
    lifestyle and his receipt of gifts from his father.  In submissions at trial,
    the respondent asked for the termination of child support.  He made this
    request because he earned no income and was not capable of earning any income.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    a five-day trial, Manton J. dismissed the appellant’s claim, including her
    claim for retroactive support and for an order that the respondent contribute
    to the child’s special or extraordinary expenses.
     The trial judge also vacated the consent child support order of $117 monthly.  In
    her factum, the appellant seeks to set aside the trial judge’s order and
    substitute an order for child support in the amount of $1,180.00 monthly,
    retroactive in varying amounts to 1998.  In oral argument, the appellant
    sought an order for child support of $1,500.00 monthly.  The appellant’s
    counsel advised that, if the appellant is unsuccessful in achieving this
    relief, she is not pursuing child support based on any social assistance
    or disability income that could be imputed to the respondent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, in my view and in the circumstances of this case,
    the trial judge made no reversible error in exercising his discretion to
    refuse to impute income to the respondent.  Accordingly, I would dismiss
    the appeal.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Background</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, Stephanie Bak, age 38, and the respondent, Mark Dobell, age 41,
    are the parents of Jacqueline, who is now thirteen years of age.  Jacqueline
    has various disabilities, which leave her at a disadvantage in her education,
    as well as socially. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jacqueline
    was born while the parties were living together when both were students at
    the Ontario College of Art in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto.  Three months after Jacqueline’s birth, the appellant moved with
    the child to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Ottawa.  Since then, the respondent, and his family, have had little or no
    contact with Jacqueline.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant works as an artist.  She has generally earned less than $10,000
    annually.  While her art is gaining more recognition, she projected an income
    of no more than a $15,000 for this year.  The appellant lives with Jacqueline
    in a rent-geared-to-income cooperative.  Although her means are not entirely
    clear on the record before this court, it would seem that Jacqueline has
    access both to extra tutoring and to significant extra-curricular activities.  It
    seems that the appellant manages these expenses with assistance from her
    mother and other family members.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent, Mark Dobell, has long-term problems, which began in elementary
    school and persisted through the four different high schools he attended.  A
    thorough psychological assessment undertaken in 2004 established that the
    respondent suffers from severe personality disorders, including both Antisocial
    Personality Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder.  He also presents
    with symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and mood swings.  These
    disorders, which are chronic and severe, explain the respondent’s historic
    and ongoing inability to sustain employment, even though he receives therapy
    twice weekly and follows an anti-depressant medication regime.  At trial,
    the evidence indicated that the respondent would need ongoing therapy for
    three to five years.  While the respondent’s behaviour has improved with
    therapy and medication, his ability to earn an income has not.  The evidence
    of the respondent’s inability to earn an income, which was confirmed in follow-up
    reports late in 1994 and in 1995, was not challenged at trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
    the respondent’s disability, and his lack of success in sustaining employment,
    his father, William Dobell, has made extensive efforts to assist his son
    to find a means of becoming self-sufficient.  At his father’s expense, the
    respondent has tried many careers, including art, glass blowing, scuba diving
    (at an expense of approximately $60,000, inclusive of equipment) and training
    as a private investigator, none of which has resulted in gainful sustained
    employment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> As
    well as other endeavours, most recently at the time of trial, the respondent
    was making efforts to establish a business in custom motorcycle building.  This
    plan was supported by the respondent’s therapist, who recommended it as the
    most suitable profession for the respondent.  To this end, the respondent
    sought an apprenticeship in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    , a $25,000 initiative supported by his father.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to his generosity in financing specific career training for his
    son, William Dobell supports the respondent by providing him with funds for
    his day-to-day needs.  In 2001, that support amounted to about $1,000 monthly.  It
    was increased to $1,450 in 2002 and to $1,750 in May 2003 and remained at
    that level to the time of trial.  The increased amount took into account
    inflation and the respondent’s likely increased expenses living with his
    partner, who was unemployed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>William
    Dobell testified that, at first, he varied the support each month depending
    on the respondent’s needs, which he ascertained by questioning him about
    his expenses to see if they could be decreased.  However, the variable payments
    proved too cumbersome and the respondent had difficulty cashing his father’s
    cheques, according to his father, because he presented to banks as “some
    hippie”.  The banks would call William Dobell before accepting the cheques.  As
    a result, William Dobell began depositing a consistent amount into the respondent’s
    bank account every month.  He intends to discontinue this support when the
    respondent is able to make a living, although he is uncertain when or if
    this will happen. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to the monthly support, the respondent’s father has also funded
    all the respondent’s medical, psychological, chiropractic, legal, and veterinarian
    bills.  In addition, in 2000, he bought a condominium for the respondent’s
    use at a cost of $133,400.  He registered the condominium in the respondent’s
    name to instil a pride of ownership that he hoped would motivate the respondent
    to “behave in a more conventional manner.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent has managed to obtain employment from time to time, although he
    has not been successful in maintaining that employment.  Between 1997 and
    2000, the respondent worked periodically, either as a security guard or as
    a superintendent of an apartment building.  In these jobs, he earned between
    $8,900 and $15,200 per year.  In 1998, the appellant applied for and obtained
    a consent order for child support in the amount of $117 monthly, based on
    the respondent’s then annual earnings of $14,500.  William Dobell did not
    know about and was not involved with the appellant’s application at the time.  In
    any event, consistent with his diagnosis, the respondent was unable to maintain
    his employment. Since 2000, the respondent has not earned any significant
    income, although he received employment insurance of $2,859 in 2001.  Despite
    his lack of employment, the respondent continued to pay the child support
    until the consent order was vacated by the final order under appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    this litigation progressed, the respondent disclosed the monthly support
    he received from his father, as well as the condominium, then valued at $242,000,
    a $55,000 car he received as a graduation gift, a $5,000 motorcycle and $4,500
    in cash.  A year later, the respondent’s updated financial statement showed
    the condominium at a value of $315,000. In 2004, the condominium was sold
    for $326,000; $290,000 of which was transferred to the respondent’s father
    and, as a result of a court order, held in trust pending the outcome of the
    trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the course of the proceeding, William Dobell bought a house in Stouffville
    for approximately $350,000, which he registered in his own name.  The respondent
    lives in that house with his partner. William Dobell also provided the respondent
    with a further $75,000 to allow him to renovate the premises and to buy the
    materials necessary for his motorcycle business.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    neither party sought to adduce any fresh evidence on this appeal, this court
    has no information about whether the respondent is currently earning any
    income from this endeavour. </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial proceedings</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    primary issue at trial was whether the respondent and Jacqueline were the
    beneficiaries of a family trust allegedly set up by the respondent’s paternal
    grandfather.  As an alternative position, the appellant sought retroactive
    child support calculated on an imputed average annual income to the respondent
    of $164,479, based on the value of his lifestyle.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    support of her position on the issue of income imputation, the appellant
    called Ms. Chartrand, a co-worker of the appellant’s mother. Although Ms.
    Chartrand had no familiarity with family law, she was accepted as an expert
    chartered accountant to calculate the respondent’s income.  Ms. Chartrand
    testified that the respondent had an income equivalent to $877,970 over the
    eight-year period between 1998 and 2005.  That figure included income that
    Ms. Chartrand imputed to the respondent based on the value to him of the
    residence provided by his father, which she assessed at an annual rate of
    ten percent of the value of the house.  Her income calculations also included
    large amounts for depreciation of the respondent’s car and his motorcycle,
    as well as amounts expended for his career training. In arriving at her figures,
    Ms. Chartrand did not distinguish between capital acquisitions and the periodic
    support. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>William
    Dobell testified that the monetary gifts he provided for his son, both by
    way of capital and as periodic support, were bestowed in an effort to promote
    the respondent’s self-sufficiency and, pending that self-sufficiency, to
    keep the respondent from starving and “off the streets.”  Given his son’s
    personality disorders, William Dobell testified that he was concerned about
    how the respondent would behave if he lived on the streets.  William Dobell
    only supported his son for what he considered to be necessary for his day-to-day
    living.  He saw no evidence of a “fancy” lifestyle on the respondent’s part,
    or that of his current partner, and if he did see such evidence, he said
    he would reduce the amount of support.  The trial judge accepted that William
    Dobell gave funds to his son out of a sense of obligation and to prevent
    the respondent from otherwise being a burden on the taxpayer.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge, who noted that a considerable amount of trial time was spent
    on the issue of the alleged trust, concluded, “it is clear that the Respondent’s
    grandfather died and left his entire estate to his two sons and not to the
    Respondent.”  The finding that there is no trust is not challenged on appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    considering the relevant provisions of the <i>Guidelines</i>, including its
    definition of income and the potential for imputing income under s. 19(1),
    the trial judge declined to impute the gifts provided by William Dobell to
    Mark Dobell as <i>Guidelines </i>income.  Furthermore, he held that the grandfather
    should not indirectly be required to pay support for an obligation that was
    not his responsibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    support of this conclusion, the trial judge found that William Dobell’s generosity
    was purely voluntary, the respondent had no entitlement to the gifts, the
    gifts were intended only to encourage the respondent’s self-sufficiency,
    the gifts did not provide the respondent with an extravagant lifestyle, and
    they were provided by William Dobell because he is a
    “person of substantial means that will not let his son depend on welfare.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    the trial judge was not asked to impute any other income to the respondent,
    such as an amount equivalent to social assistance or a Canada Pension Plan
    disability pension, he dismissed the appellant’s claim for child support
    and vacated the $117 consent order.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her factum on this appeal, the appellant argued that it is appropriate, in
    the circumstances of this case, to impute income to the respondent based
    on the respondent’s lifestyle.  In addition, the appellant submitted during
    oral argument that the gifts from the respondent’s father should be imputed
    to the respondent as <i>Guidelines</i> income. As part of his second argument,
    the appellant submitted that the gift income was analogous to trust income.  </p>

    discretion, a discretion that was generally broadly exercised to achieve
    a fair result in all the circumstances.  This resulted in a correspondingly
    wide range of child support orders.  Since family law lawyers were unable
    to predict a likely child support outcome with accuracy, the parties often

    those objectives in mind, and except as otherwise specifically provided,
    Parliament decided that child support for minor children would be in “the
    amount set out in the applicable table” (Table support).  Table support would
    be based on the number of children and on “<span style='font-family:&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;

    s. 3(1)). </span>In this way, Parliament sought to use fair and objective

      This restricts the definition of presumptive “income” to income that is
      subject to taxation. In this way, a payor’s income can be easily ascertained

    turning to that question, I will first deal with the appellant’s argument

    I have said, under the <i>Guidelines</i>, child support is calculated on
    the payor’s total income for income tax purposes.  Lifestyle is clearly not
    a type of income, receipt or benefit included in total income.  Canadians
    are not taxed on lifestyle.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    clearly, however, a payor’s lifestyle often will be relevant to whether a
    court may impute income under s. 19(1) of the <i>Guidelines</i>.  For example,
    it may be apparent from lifestyle that a payor is receiving undeclared income
    because he or she has historically worked, lives comfortably with the usual
    trappings, and yet declares minimal income for tax or child support purposes.  In
    such a case, the recipient who calls evidence of the payor’s lifestyle will
    ask the court to draw the reasonable inference that the payor must have a
    greater income than he or she has disclosed. </p>

    occurred in <i>Davids v. Davids</i>, [1998] O.J. No. 2859 (Gen. Div.), where
    a chartered accountant was able to demonstrate from the husband’s financial
    data that he was receiving income from a source he could or would not explain.  Given
    the absence of any explanation, the court drew an inference that the husband’s
    earnings were more than reported.  Similarly, in <i>Biamonte v. Biamonte</i> (1998),
    36 R.F.L. (4th) 349 (Ont. Gen. Div.), based on evidence of the parties’ lifestyle,
    income was imputed to a husband who was shown to have a cash component to
    his restaurant business in addition to his declared income.  While these
    cases demonstrate that a party’s lifestyle can inform the question of whether
    the payor has diverted income, or underreported income<a href="#_ftn5"

line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,

line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    funds were not used to finance the respondent’s day-to-day expenses nor were
    they given to the respondent to spend in his discretion.  Instead, they were
    akin to an investment by William Dobell in the respondent’s future: an investment,
    as the trial judge noted, that may lead to the respondent generating income
    in his own right.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    example of this type of expenditure was the expensive scuba training, which
    included significant equipment costs as well as the expense of buying a vehicle
    adequate to transport equipment.  Unfortunately, the respondent’s potential
    for a scuba diving career ended when he suffered physical injuries, which
    continue to require treatment.  The motorcycle business proposed at trial
    is similarly costly, both in terms of training and the cost to set up shop.  </p>

    my view, expenditures of this nature made, not by the respondent, but by
    his father for the specific cost of career advancement cannot be said to
    be income to the respondent under either the <i>Guidelines</i>’ definition
    of presumptive income or as income that it is appropriate to impute to the
    respondent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    in addition to supporting the respondent’s training, William Dobell provided
    the respondent with a place to live, first in the condominium and later in
    the Stouffville property. As the trial judge found, the residences were bought
    to provide the respondent with a roof over his head so that he would not
    live on the street.  The respondent was not at liberty to sell these properties
    and use the funds for other purposes.  The evidence disclosed that the condominium
    was registered in the respondent’s name for the sole purpose of trying to
    create a sense of pride of ownership so that the respondent would follow
    a “normal” lifestyle and become a functioning member of society. The evidence
    supports the conclusion that neither the condominium, nor its proceeds, were
    available to the respondent to expend as he wished.  Furthermore, the respondent
    has no ownership interest or entitlement to the present Stouffville property,
    which is registered in his father’s name. In these circumstances, the trial
    judge made no error in concluding that neither the capital value of the condominium,
    nor of the Stouffville property, should be imputed to the respondent as income.</p>

line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    conclusion is consistent with a model of child support based on a payor’s
    income, not on his or her capital. While income from investments is part
    of a payor’s total income, his or her underlying investments are not. A payor
    is not expected to sell capital assets, such as a house and car, for the
    purpose of generating income from which to pay support, unless the “property
    is not reasonably utilized to generate income” (s. 19(1)(e)). Even assuming
    the applicability of this provision, on the facts of this case, the respondent
    did and does not have the option to sell capital assets to generate investment
    income, particularly in the circumstance that the particular acquisitions
    were made by William Dobell for the specific purpose of encouraging the respondent’s
    conventional conduct, with the overall objective that he achieve financial
    independence. </p>

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Jackson</i>, [1997] O.J. No. 4790 (Gen. Div.), support was awarded based

    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    <i>Jackson</i><i>, </i>Pardu J. calculated support on the husband’s receipt
    of trust funds, which included both capital and income.  While capital is
    not usually considered income, the trial judge noted that the family standard
    of living, for almost four years prior to the parties’ separation, had been
    based on the receipt of capital payments made at the rate of $105,000 annually.  Importantly,
    the order made was only an interim one and Pardu J. explicitly noted at para.

    “ultimately have to accept a lower standard of living”.  </p>

    contrast to the receipt of capital, income that could be earned from capital
    is relevant to child support and will be included in income. For example,
    in both <i>Ellis v. Carpenter, </i>[1999] O.J. No. 934 (Gen. Div.) and <i>St.
    Amand v. St. Amand, </i>[2006] N.B.J. No. 261 (Q.B.), a payor parent accrued
    significant one-time, non-recurring sums of capital – in <i>Ellis, </i>by
    way of inheritance and in <i>St. Amand</i><a

    the payor’s obligation to pay child support from those capital amounts, the
    trial courts concluded that it was reasonable for the payor to spend portions
    of the sums on capital acquisitions, including the purchase of living accommodations,
    as well as for the payment of debt.  However, investment income on the remaining
    capital was imputed to the parent for the purpose of calculating his child
    support obligation. </p>

    pursuant to <i>Ellis, St. Amand, </i>and s. 19(1)(e) circumstances, part
    or all of the income that could be derived from capital may be imputed as
    income.  However, in this case, because of the nature of the capital investments,
    they generate no income and the respondent is not in a position to sell them
    to generate income. </p>

    if the shelter (and vehicles) had been provided for the respondent’s use
    by his current partner, and not by his father, resulting “income” would likely
    not have been imputed to the respondent, except to the extent that the respondent’s
    expenses were reduced as a result.  This is because it is the parent’s obligation
    to provide support and not the obligation of the parent’s new spouse. The
    result should not be different solely because the provider is the respondent’s

    income.  The professional fees all came within a category of necessary medical
    or therapeutic expenses, or were truly in the nature of gifts to assist with
    unusual and non-recurring expenses.  They were not given to the respondent

    statutory interpretation assist with determining legislative intent on this
    issue.  I look first at whether the government deliberately excluded gifts
    from the definition of income and from the circumstances included as appropriate
    ones in which to impute income.  I then consider, if that is the case, whether
    gifts can ever be included in income for child support purposes. </p>

    the <i>Guidelines</i> were enacted, the legislature is presumed to have been
    knowledgeable about the various sources of taxable and non-taxable income

    income is taxable.  It can be presumed from this knowledge that the legislature

    did not include gifts within the ambit of imputed income, it can be presumed, <u>in

      question by comparing gifts to the “appropriate” circumstances listed by
      the legislature in s. 19(1).  Income will be imputed where the respondent
      is intentionally unemployed or underemployed (s. 19(1)(a)); has special
      income tax circumstances or unreasonable deductions (s. 19(1)(b),(c),(g)

    the payor’s income to compensate for anomalous income tax treatment.  Neither

    it also included in his income, on consent, financial assistance that the
    payor received from his parents.  However, this result largely followed from
    the absence of evidence in that case about the payor’s earning capacity,
    making it necessary to impute income inferred from the family’s pre-separation
    lifestyle.  Given the concession by the payor’s counsel that parental assistance
    should be included, the trial judge gave no reasons for doing so.  Moreover,
    the order at issue was only on an interim basis.</p>

    assistance in his income for the purpose only of an interim support order.  Perhaps,
    of equal significance to the imputation of income in that case, was the fact
    that the respondent owned $1.8 million of capital assets.  Accordingly, <i>Haq</i> cannot

    her, Justice J.R. MacKinnon declined to impute income from gifts given to
    a payor spouse in circumstances where the funds were provided by the payor’s
    parents on a temporary basis to assist her through a period of disability.  The <i>Whelan</i> facts

    child and were more in the nature of support for an adult child than in the

    the amount of the monthly support given by William Dobell met, but did not
    exceed, Mark Dobell’s needs.  This was not challenged in cross-examination,

    was not that the respondent had the ability to provide child support, but
    that William Dobell had the ability.  The appellant’s trial counsel argued
    that a child support order would “not cost Mark Dobell a cent”, because the
    expense would be assumed by William Dobell, who would not want his son found
    in contempt of a court order.  The problem with this argument, as the trial
    judge noted, is that it is not William Dobell’s obligation to pay child support
    and, in the circumstances of this case, any order of child support made against
    the respondent would “in fact be imposing that obligation on the respondent’s

    case of <i>M.A.K. v. K.A.B., </i>[2000] P.E.I.J. No. 8 (S.C.T.D.), imputed
    income to a father who was underemployed.  While the trial judge considered
    the value of room and board provided to the father by his parents, and suggested
    an amount of income that could be imputed on this basis, the case was not
    decided on this basis. Instead, the trial judge imputed an annual income
    to the father based on the amount he was capable of earning as minimum wage. </p>
