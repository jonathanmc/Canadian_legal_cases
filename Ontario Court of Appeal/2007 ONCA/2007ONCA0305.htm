    conclusion that the respondent’s pre-separation conduct was unconscionable.  The
    respondent<span

    gifting property with an approximate value of $190,000 to a third party.  As

    between the parties’ net family properties, which was only $10,466.  </p>

    this further appeal, the appellant asks this court to find that s. 5(6) allows
    a court to award more than 100 per cent of the difference between the parties<span style='"Times New Roman"'>’</span> net
    family properties.  Specifically, the appellant argues that a court may award
    100 per cent of the value of the offending party’s net family property to
    his or her spouse.  The appellant also asks this court to find that the trial
    judge ought to have done so in this case. </p>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> This
    was a third marriage for the appellant, Astrid von Czieslik, and a second
    for the respondent, Anthony Ayuso.  They married in 1989 and separated in
    2000.  Both parties owned properties at the date of marriage and both placed
    mortgages of different amounts on those properties to assist with the purchase
    of their matrimonial home.  The appellant’s contribution was approximately
    $140,000 from a mortgage she placed on her
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Maughan Crescent property and the respondent’s contribution was approximately
    $60,000 from a mortgage on his
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Quebec Avenue property (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Quebec property). </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Unbeknownst
    to the appellant, the respondent registered a further $250,000 mortgage on
    his
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Quebec property in 1994, when the parties<span
style='"Times New Roman"'>’</span> marriage was beginning to deteriorate.  The
    mortgage was in favour of Three R Corporation (Three R).  While the respondent
    had no interest in Three R, as noted by the trial judge, its principal was
    his close friend.  Apparently, Three R did not advance any funds under the
    mortgage and the respondent made no payments of either principal or interest.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> In
    January 2000, about ten months prior to the parties’ separation, the respondent
    sold the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Quebec property to an innocent third party for $330,000.  The respondent
    allegedly received nothing from the proceeds of sale.  According to the closing
    documentation, $189,683.14 was disbursed to Three R to discharge the mortgage.  It
    is this amount, which I refer to as $190,000, that is at issue in this appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant first learned about the sale of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Quebec property and the Three R mortgage and its discharge well after the
    parties’ separation.  She did not learn about the particulars of the transactions
    until trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Since
    the separation, the parties have divorced and the respondent has retired
    to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Spain</st1:country-region>
    .  The appellant, also retired, lives in the matrimonial home and is in receipt
    of a disability pension.</p>
  <h2>Trial result</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge concluded that the respondent
    “intentionally incurred [the Three R mortgage] for the purpose of keeping
    the equity held by him in that asset or any portion of the proceeds of its
    sale out of von Czieslik’s hands.”  On the basis of the figures presented
    at trial, the trial judge found that, but for the respondent’s surreptitious
    dealings, the respondent would have included the $190,000 mortgage proceeds,
    in his statement of net family property, resulting in a $95,000 equalization
    credit for the appellant. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Since
    the appellant acknowledged that the respondent had effectively gifted the
    asset prior to the parties’ separation, the respondent would not have had
    any ownership interest at the date of separation.  Accordingly, there was
    no interest regarding this asset to be included in his net family property.     </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant did not attempt to reinstate the
    <st1:place

    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Quebec property or mortgage as an asset by applying to set aside the mortgage
    or the sale as fraudulent under the <span class=Italics>Fraudulent Conveyances
    Act</span>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.29 (<span class=Italics>FCA</span>).  The appellant
    also claimed no interest in the property by way of constructive trust or
    otherwise.  Further, the appellant failed to persuade the trial judge that
    the $190,000 should be included in the respondent’s net family property as
    a receivable owing to him by Three R.  The appellant was unsuccessful in
    obtaining leave to appeal this finding.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge did conclude, however, that the respondent’s conduct in effectively
    giving the asset away was unconscionable on three separate bases under s.
    5(6), including as an “intentional or reckless depletion of … net family
    property”.  This conclusion is not appealed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    discussing the amount of redress available under s. 5(6), and her understanding
    that she was precluded from awarding the appellant more than 100 per cent
    of the difference, the trial judge stated at paras. 47-50:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Counsel for Ayuso
    submits that the Court lacks power under the statute to do more than give
    100 per cent of the difference in net family properties to the Plaintiff.  She
    argues that the power to direct an unequal division under s. 5(6) of the
    Act is limited to the difference in net family properties and does not include
    a general power to rearrange family assets. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>That interpretation
    of the Court's powers under section 5(6) of the Act is supported by the preponderance
    of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario authorities: see <span class=Italics>Stone v. Stone</span>, 55 O.R.
    (3d) 491 (
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), in which J.A. Feldman (at para. 42) states: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote align=left style='text-align:left'>&quot;...
    section 5(6) of the <span class=Italics>Family Law Act</span> only empowers
    the court to order an unequal division of the difference in value of net
    family property.  It is not a provision which can be used to set aside previous
    dispositions of property to third parties.  Consequently, any order must
    be based on the net family property amounts of the spouses as determined
    under s. 4.  The order cannot reflect the value of any property which is
    not part of that net family property value.  As a result, although the reckless
    depletion of assets by one spouse can be used by the court as a factor in
    assessing unconscionable conduct and making an unequal distribution, the
    section will only be useful if the spouse who made the transfers of property
    has sufficient property left on the valuation date to make an order for  an
    unequal sharing an effective remedy for the wronged spouse.&quot;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>This same authority,
    which follows the judgment of the

    Zadegan</span>, [2002] O.J. No. 2190.  I am of the view that this interpretation
    of the Court's jurisdiction under section 5(6) of the Act is likewise binding
    in this case. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>In view of the
    factual findings as outlined above, I am of the opinion that Ayuso's reprehensible
    conduct makes it necessary for the Court to order that the full amount of
    the difference between the parties' respective family property, i.e., 100
    per cent of that difference, should be paid by Ayuso to von Czieslik.  To
    do otherwise, or to equalize the net family property, would be unconscionable
    in these circumstances.</p>

    trial judge<span style='"Times New Roman"'>’</span>s equalization calculation,
    which was based on each party’s net family property statement, resulted in
    a $10,466 difference between the respondent’s net family property of $74,385

    the respondent’s removal of the $190,000 from the parties<span

    appellant’s appeal of the trial judge’s decision was dismissed by the Divisional
    Court on the basis that s. 5(6) does not empower the court to order an unequal
    division beyond the difference in value of the parties’ net family properties.  In
    his reasons on behalf of the panel, O’Driscoll J. concluded at para. 9:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>In view of the

    a court to award the other spouse “an amount that is <span class=Underline>more

  <h2>Analysis</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> This
    question of statutory interpretation invokes the guiding principle frequently
    quoted with approval by the Supreme Court of Canada:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Today there is
    only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act  are to be read
    in their entire context, in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously
    with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, a reading of s. 5(6) in accordance with this principle leads to
    the conclusion that a court may award an amount of money that is more (or
    less) than the difference between the parties’ net family properties.  Since
    there is no cap, restriction or limitation on “more than”, on its face, the
    legislation does not limit such an award to 100 per cent of the difference.  While
    the legislature could have provided that the award may be “no more than”,
    or “cannot exceed”, the difference between the parties<span style='"Times New Roman"'>’</span> net
    family properties, it did not do so.  Thus, a plain reading of the provision
    does not support the respondent’s argument that s. 5(6) only allows for reapportionment
    of the difference between the parties<span style='"Times New Roman"'>’</span> net
    family properties.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    find support for this interpretation by considering both the purpose of the
    provision and its context.  Since the preamble of the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <span
 class=Italics>FLA</span> provides for the “orderly and equitable settlement
    of the affairs of the spouses”, the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    <span class=Italics>FLA</span> is intended to assist parties in obtaining
    a fair and objectively predictable resolution of family issues.  To promote
    predictability and consistency, the legislation does not include a consideration
    of “fault” by a party, with two important exceptions where a party’s conduct
    is sufficiently egregious to be labelled unconscionable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Regarding
    support, s. 33(10) provides that a
    “court may in determining the amount of support have regard to a course of
    conduct that is so unconscionable as to constitute an obvious and gross repudiation
    of the relationship.”  Regarding property, s. 5(6) provides for an award
    to a spouse where equalization would be unconscionable having regard to the
    listed circumstances.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Property
    is equalized under the <span
class=Italics>FLA</span> through the three-step process set out by Cory J. in <span
class=Italics>Rawluk v. Rawluk</span>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 70.  First, a court determines
    the ownership of property under s. 4.  Second, it calculates the equalization
    payment under s. 5(1).  Third, and only after a determination of the first
    two steps, will a court turn its mind to what Cory J. described as “a last
    avenue of judicial discretion” provided by s. 5(6) to award an amount having
    regard to a spouse<span style='"Times New Roman"'>’</span>s unconscionable
    conduct.  This approach of determining ownership, equalization, and unconsionability,
    in that order, was confirmed in <span class=Italics>Berdette v. Berdette</span> (1991),
    3 O.R. (3d) 513 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Clearly,
    a reapportionment of net family property under s. 5(6) is not a declaration
    about ownership of property, but only about distributing the value of the
    parties’ net family properties to redress unconsionable conduct.  This is
    reinforced by the legislative restriction of s. 5(6)’s application to certain
    enumerated circumstances, none of which have to do with ownership, but all
    of which relate to fault-based conduct on the part of the other spouse.  See

    a s. 5(6) reapportionment is only available on those rare occasions when
    a party is able to meet the high threshold required to establish unconscionability.  Only
    in such an exceptional case does the legislature give a court the discretion
    to fashion a remedy</p>

    keeping with the

    <span
 class=Italics>FLA</span> objective of providing for the “orderly and equitable” resolution

    furnished the courts with a remedy within the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <span class=Italics>FLA</span>, which permits redress for a wronged spouse

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    interpretation urged by the respondent, which would restrict the court to
    reapportioning only the difference between the parties’ net family properties,
    would not be sufficient in many cases to provide a meaningful remedy and,
    thus, would not achieve the “equitable sharing” envisaged by the legislature.  This
    is so because the difference between parties’ net family properties may vary
    radically from case to case.  In one case the difference may be minimal,
    as it is for these parties, and in another it may be significant.  There
    is simply no rational connection between the unconscionable conduct and the
    amount of the “difference”
    between the parties’ net family properties.  Moreover, there would be little
    point in providing a remedy for unconscionable conduct and then restricting
    that remedy to the difference in the parties’ net family properties. </p>

    such a narrow interpretation would render the legislature’s remedy meaningless
    in many cases - for example, where there is unconscionable conduct, but the
    difference between the net family property values is very little - it is
    an interpretation to be avoided.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

    a court with reasonable tools to provide redress to the wronged party.  In
    my view, such an interpretation is available on the plain wording of s. 5(6)
    considered in the context of the legislation's purpose.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

    legislature's delineation of property to be included as net family property
    references property that the parties accrued during their partnership.  When
    a party absconds with part of that property through unconscionable conduct,
    he or she has altered the value of the net family property that the legislature
    intended would be equalized.  It must be that, by the enactment of s. 5(6),
    the legislature intended to give the courts the ability to correct the wrong
    by awarding the other party the value of the offending party<span style='"Times New Roman"'>’</span>s
    net family property.  </p>

    a court to award an amount up to the whole of an offending spouse’s net family
    property as is appropriate to compensate for unconscionable conduct provides
    a real, substantial, and meaningful remedy for the unconscionable conduct.  Such
    a remedy serves, as far as is practicable, to rectify the otherwise unconscionable
    result and, at the same time, sends a warning to spouses tempted to hide
    or divert assets that it is not worthwhile to do so. </p>

    an interpretation that gives the court the authority to award an amount up

class=Italics>supra</span> was not about the parameters of a s. 5(6) award.  Rather,
    it was about property to be included in the first “ownership” step of the
    equalization process.  <span class=Italics>Stone</span> concluded that a
    spouse’s pre-separation property that no longer belonged to a spouse on valuation
    day could not be included in their net family property.  In addition, it
    held that the
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <span class=Italics>FLA</span> is not a complete and exclusive code of conduct
    so that a party does not have to exhaust its
    <st1:place

    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <span class=Italics>FLA</span> remedies before seeking a remedy under the <span class=Italics>FCA</span> to
    set aside a fraudulent transaction.  Thus, a spouse applying to equalize
    assets under the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    <span class=Italics>FLA</span> could also apply to set aside a conveyance

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    to apply under the <span class=Italics>FCA</span>, the applicant spouse must
    have status as “a creditor or other”.  The question in <span class=Italics>Stone</span> was
    whether the application of s. 5(3) of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    <span class=Italics>FLA</span> provided that status.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span

    the issue in <span class=Italics>Stone</span>.  No relief was sought under
    s. 5(6) of the <span
class=Italics>FLA</span>.  Since <span
class=Italics>Stone</span> did not consider the interpretation of s. 5(6), the
    extracted sentence cannot be taken as purporting to address the quantum of
    a s. 5(6) award.</p>

    the fact that the sentence relied upon has been taken out of context is evident
    from reading it alongside the sentence that immediately follows: “It [s.
    5(6)] is not a provision which can be used to set aside previous dispositions
    of properties to third parties.”  Thus, <span class=Italics>Stone</span> stands
    only for the proposition that a party cannot use s. 5(6) to settle ownership
    issues and not as a definitive interpretation of the parameters of a s. 5(6)
    award.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    the sentence in question is to be contrasted with para. 39 of <span class=Italics>Stone</span>,
    which states that in the event of unconscionable conduct, a court “will order
    a payment of more or less than one-half of the difference.”  The language
    in para. 39 closely mirrors the actual language of s. 5(6).  This sentence
    supports the conclusion that <span

    in <span class=Italics>Stone</span>, the appellant was seeking a remedy under
    the <span class=Italics>FCA</span> because the respondent had virtually nothing
    in his estate from which the appellant could claim a s. 5(6) award.  In this
    case, however, the appellant elected to rely on the unconscionability provisions

    11 O.R. (3d) 233 (Gen. Div.), and <span class=Italics>Hamilton</span>, <span

    the wife acquired two properties with her own money and registered both in

    appeal, the wife raised four grounds, one of which was that the trial judge
    erred in failing to apply s. 5(6).  This court, however, found the question
    of gift to be the essential issue.  Since it was the wife who had given the
    properties to the husband, she could not argue that his offending conduct
    made her voluntary gift unconscionable.  Accordingly, <span class=Italics>Berdette</span> stands

    court in <span class=Italics>Berdette</span> did go on to give a second reason
    for holding that s. 5(6) did not apply:  since the parties’ net family properties
    were equal, there would be no equalization payment under s. 5(1) to vary
    under s. 5(6).  However, I do not read this secondary reason as determining
    that there can be no award when the parties’
    net family properties are equal<a href="#_ftn5"

    not directly concerned with the quantum of the appropriate award when the
    other spouse's conduct was found to be unconscionable.  Rather, it dealt
    only with equalization where there was no unconscionable conduct.  <span

    any event, other than when the parties’ net family properties are zero, parties
    will virtually always have different amounts of savings or pension or cars
    or jewellery or debt and, hence, differing amounts of net family property.  Only
    in the most unusual of circumstances would a situation arise where the parties’ net
    family properties are equal.  To the extent that such a situation does arise,
    as I read the wording of s. 5(6) applied to the unusual situation where there
    is no difference between the parties’ net family properties, a court may
    award an amount to the wronged spouse that is greater than zero, up to a
    maximum of the value of the offending party’s net family property.  </p>

    case of <span class=Italics>Zadegan v. Zadegan</span>, [2002] O.J. No. 2190
    (S.C.J.), also relied upon by the trial judge, is similarly of no assistance
    because it relied on, what in my view, is an incorrect interpretation of <span class=Italics>Stone</span> and <span
class=Italics>Berdette</span> regarding the parameters of s. 5(6).  In any event,
    the trial judge in <span
class=Italics>Zadegan</span> made a specific finding that there was no unconscionable
    conduct that would invoke s. 5(6).  In those circumstances, the trial judge’s
    comments on s. 5(6) were <span class=Italics>obiter</span>.  </p>

    not advance the discussion because the primary issue in that case was whether
    a spouse’s post-separation conduct was relevant to a s. 5(6) award.  In <span class=Italics>Merklinger</span>,
    the trial judge determined that the husband’s unconscionable conduct was
    sufficiently addressed by eliminating the potential $175,000 equalization
    payment to which the husband would otherwise have been entitled from the
    wife.  As a result, it was unnecessary for the court to consider whether
    the wife should have received an additional amount from the husband.  For
    this reason, the case does not directly address whether a court has jurisdiction
    to award more than 100 per cent of the difference between the parties<span
style='"Times New Roman"'>’</span> net family properties.</p>

    16 R.F.L. (5th) 300 (Ont. S.C.J.), all written by the late Professor James
    G. McLeod, which support an interpretation that restricts a s. 5(6) award
    to the difference in value between the parties’ net family property.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    a certain extent, Professor McLeod’s support of this restrictive interpretation
    was based on his perception of unfairness if no award is available when there
    is no difference in value between the parties’
    net family properties.  As I have indicated, that interpretation does not
    survive scrutiny and, in my view, a court does have the authority to make
    an award under s. 5(6) up to the value of the payor’s net family property.  In
    any event, Professor McLeod’s conclusion also depends on an interpretation
    of the cases that I have concluded is not sustainable, particularly regarding <span
class=Italics>Stone</span>, which Professor McLeod saw as the definitive authority.  </p>

    find support for my interpretation of these cases in <span class=Italics>Roseneck
    v. Gowling</span> (2002), 62 O.R. (3d) 789 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), where Weiler J.A. noted at para. 53 that in view of her conclusion that
    there was no unconscionable conduct “it is not necessary for me to resolve
    the question of whether the court may make an order under s. 5(6) which exceeds
    the difference between the spouses’ net family property.”  Clearly, in her
    view, the parameters of the calculation of a s. 5(6) award have remained
    open.  </p>

class=Italics>supra</span>, is one of the few decisions that directly addresses
    whether the amount of an award under s. 5(6) can exceed the amount of the
    difference of the parties<span style='"Times New Roman"'>’</span> net family
    properties.  In that case, in addition to an equalization payment of $150,767,
    Quinn J. awarded the wife a further $305,961 from the husband’s net family
    property under s. 5(6).  This award was to compensate the wife for the husband’s
    unconscionable conduct in fraudulently depriving her of the value of the
    shares she had held in the parties<span style='"Times New Roman"'>’</span> company.  In
    reaching this result, Quinn J. said at para. 46:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Section 5(6)
    allows the court to award an amount that is &quot;more ... than half the
    difference between the net family properties.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not,
    in my view, restrict the court to reapportioning only the difference.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
    section does not say, &quot;more ... than half, but no more than all, the
    difference.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;It reads, &quot;more ... than half the difference.&quot; </p>
  <p class=ParaNo align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>I agree. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    summary, for the reasons I have stated, on a plain reading of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <span
  class=Italics>FLA</span>, a court is not restricted in making a s. 5(6) award
    to the difference between the parties’ net family property, even when that
    difference is zero.  As s. 5(6) provides, a court may award “an amount that
    is more or less than half the difference between the net family properties”.  Accordingly,
    a court may award an amount that is greater than the difference between the
    parties<span style='"Times New Roman"'>’</span> net family properties.  If
    the difference between the parties’ net family properties is zero, a court
    may still award more or less than that amount, subject to the restriction
    that the payment ordered cannot exceed the total value of the payor’s net
    family property. </p>

    this conclusion to the facts of this case, the respondent<span style='"Times New Roman"'>’</span>s
    conduct in removing the $190,000 from his net family property was found by
    the trial judge to be unconscionable.  To redress this conduct, to the extent
    permitted by s. 5(6), the appellant is entitled to the value of the respondent<span style='"Times New Roman"'>’</span>s
