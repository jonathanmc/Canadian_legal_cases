    is a production motion brought by the appellant in connection with a proposed
    application to adduce fresh evidence on his appeal.  The appellant has sought
    the production of various documents on this appeal over the last year-and-a-half.  He
    now seeks production of documents in the possession of the Ministry of Community
    Safety and Correctional Services (the “Ministry”).  The documents sought
    by the appellant relate to certain information provided to security personnel
    at the Toronto Jail.  The information pertains to the alleged smuggling of
    contraband, including drugs, into the Toronto Jail by a correctional officer
    employed there, Ms. D. (also known as Ms. L.).  The information was apparently
    provided to the security personnel at the jail by inmates between November
    2000 and March 2002.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant, a lawyer, was convicted of supplying his client, who was an inmate
    at the Toronto Jail, with narcotics while visiting that inmate at the jail
    in November 2001.  According to the evidence adduced at trial, the drugs
    were found secreted on the inmate immediately after his visit with the appellant.  It
    was the Crown’s case, based primarily on the evidence of correctional officers,
    that the appellant had the exclusive opportunity to provide the inmate with
    the drugs.  The Crown also relied on certain post-offence conduct by the
    appellant.  The defence maintained that someone other than the appellant
    had supplied the drugs to the inmate.  The appellant testified and denied
    giving the inmate the drugs.  There was evidence, accepted by the trial judge,
    that unknown persons other than the appellant had provided drugs to this
    inmate while he was in the Toronto Jail on other occasions.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    the trial, some evidence was adduced concerning investigations into allegations
    that custodial officers were supplying inmates with drugs.  By the end of
    the trial, the appellant was aware of the following:</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>various
    inmates had accused Ms. D. of bringing contraband into the jail for inmates
    during 2002;</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms.
    D. had been investigated by the jail security staff and by the Toronto Police.  No
    charges were laid as a result of the investigations;  and</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>on
    the day the appellant allegedly supplied drugs to his client, Ms. D. was
    working on the range where his client’s cell was located.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    fact that Ms. D. was working on the range where the client’s cell was located
    was disclosed to the appellant after all the evidence had been entered at
    his trial, but before the judge had rendered his verdict.  The appellant,
    acting for himself, although with some assistance from counsel, chose not
    to pursue the matter.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the course of this application, some additional information came to light.  The
    Toronto Police investigation into Ms. D.’s activities continued until March
    2002.  That investigation was terminated by the police when Ms. D. was seen
    by police surveillance being escorted from the Toronto Jail property by Ministry
    staff.  Counsel for Ms. D. on this application advised the court that Ms.
    D. was fired at that time.  She filed a grievance that was eventually settled.  Part
    of the settlement required the destruction of any part of Ms. D.’s employment
    record that referred to the reasons for her dismissal.  The records filed
    under seal with the court contain no explanation for her dismissal and no
    reference to the subsequent settlement of her grievance.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    records filed under seal with the court consist of a series of administrative
    summaries of information provided to the jail security staff by inmates.  Most
    of the summaries contain allegations that Ms. D. was bringing contraband
    drugs into the jail for inmates and charging them a fee for that service.  The
    material which was filed with the court also contains statements given by
    inmates in support of these allegations.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    approach the court takes when an appellant seeks production of documents
    in the possession of a third party in connection with a proposed fresh evidence
    application is set out in <i>R. v. McNeil</i> (2006), 215 C.C.C. (3d) 22
    at paras. 44-47 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), leave to appeal to S.C.C. requested [2007] S.C.C.A. No. 57.  The moving
    party must first demonstrate that the material sought is “likely relevant” to
    the fresh evidence application: see paras. 39-44.  If the moving party establishes
    that the material is “likely relevant”, the records are produced to the court.  The
    court then examines the records and after receiving further submissions from
    interested parties, determines whether denial of access to the documents
    would unduly restrict the appellant’s ability to prosecute his or her appeal.  At
    this stage of the inquiry, in addition to the effect of non-production on
    the appellant’s ability to prosecute his or her appeal, the court considers
    any potential adverse effect of production on the legitimate interests of
    others, including–but not necessarily limited to–privacy rights:  see para.
    47.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    different panel of this court held in December 2006 that the appellant had
    demonstrated the “likely relevance” of the material in the Ministry’s possession.  In
    so holding, the court was satisfied that there was a reasonable possibility
    that the material could assist the appellant in developing admissible evidence
    identifying someone other than the appellant as the source of drugs, and
    that such evidence could be received on appeal:  see <i>R. v. McNeil</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at paras. 40-42.  This panel must consider the second stage of the inquiry
    outlined in <i>McNeil</i>.  The factors to be considered at this stage of
    the analysis are set out in <i>R. v. McNeil</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 47.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    indicated above, counsel for the Ministry supplied the court with copies
    of the relevant documents.  Counsel also provided the court with copies that
    had been redacted to protect the identity of confidential informants and
    other third parties who are identified  in the records, but who have no involvement
    in this matter.  Counsel for the Ministry and counsel for the Crown argued
    that none of the records should be ordered produced.  Alternatively, they
    argued that only the edited versions should be produced to the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms.
    D. was represented on these proceedings.  Her counsel stressed the significant
    privacy interests that Ms. D. has in the material found in the documents.  We
    agree with counsel’s contention that Ms. D. has a legitimate and significant
    privacy interest in the material.  It must be stressed that she has never
    been charged with anything arising out of the investigations conducted by
    the Ministry and the police in 2001 and 2002.  The records contain serious
    allegations against Ms. D.  She has had no opportunity to know the basis
    for these allegations or to refute them.  The source of the allegations does
    not necessarily inspire confidence in their trustworthiness.  In addition,
    all of the allegations are several years old.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms.
    D.’s privacy interests, however, come up against the appellant’s <i>prima
    facie</i> right to access material that may be relevant to his proposed fresh
    evidence application.  While it does not appear likely that the material
    in the possession of the Ministry will itself constitute fresh evidence,
    there is a realistic possibility that it could lead to material that would
    constitute admissible fresh evidence.  Setting aside due diligence concerns
    for the moment, credible evidence indicating that Ms. D. was engaged in bringing
    contraband drugs into the jail for inmates, combined with evidence that Ms.
    D. had ready access to the appellant’s client shortly before the appellant
    met with the client, could potentially meet the criteria for the admissibility
    of fresh evidence on appeal and result in an order for a new trial.  The
    appellant has a formidable claim to the production of this material in the
    legitimate pursuit of his appeal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the Crown argued that the appellant had the opportunity at trial to pursue
    the claim that Ms. D. could have been the source of the drugs found on the
    appellant’s client.  Counsel submits that the appellant decided not to pursue
    that line of defence at trial and should not be allowed to pursue it now,
    some four years later.  This argument is essentially a claim that the appellant
    has not exercised due diligence in seeking to implicate Ms. D. in the supplying
    of the drugs.  Even if one were to assume an absence of due diligence, that
    absence would not necessarily preclude the admissibility of fresh evidence
    on appeal to demonstrate that Ms. D. was potentially the source of the drugs.  Nor
    is this a case where it can be unequivocally said at this stage that there
    was a failure to exercise due diligence.  If the absence of due diligence
    does not necessarily mean the fresh evidence could not be adduced, it follows
    that the absence of due diligence should not preclude a production order.  The
    question of whether the appellant exercised due diligence and, if not, what
    effect the failure to do so should have on a fresh evidence application are
    best left to the stage of the process at which the admissibility of any tendered
    evidence is considered:  see <i>R. v. McNeil</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para.
    69.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    think a production order should be made.  The privacy interests of Ms. D.
    can be protected with a non-publication order prohibiting publication of
    her identity or anything that could identify her as the person referred to
    in the records.  The non-publication order should extend to the documents
    themselves.  The documents are provided to counsel for the appellant on the
    implicit understanding that they will not be used for any purpose other than
    pursuing the fresh evidence application.  The documents cannot be regarded
    as being in the public domain and no claim for access to them can be made
    on that basis.  The documents cannot be disseminated or used for any purpose
    other than the proposed fresh evidence application.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    agree with counsel’s contention that the edited version of the documents
    should be produced to counsel for the appellant at this time.  I would also
    ask counsel for the Ministry to provide counsel for the appellant with a
    brief explanation for each redaction.  Most are self-evident and I would
    hope that counsel can work out any disputed redactions.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having
    determined that production of the edited version of the material is appropriate,
    it is essential to add that production of the material should not delay the
    hearing of this appeal any more than is absolutely necessary.  The appellant
    was convicted of a very serious offence over three years ago and sentenced
    soon afterwards. Since he launched this appeal, he has made various requests
    for production.  Those requests have changed from time to time.  He has been
    on bail throughout this prolonged and somewhat leisurely process.  It is
    essential to the due administration of justice that this appeal be heard.  The
    court was told that the appeal is perfected apart from the fresh evidence
    application.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    see no reason why the edited version of the documents cannot be produced
    to the appellant immediately.  While the appellant will have to take additional
    steps to prepare the fresh evidence application, those steps must also be
    taken without delay.  Counsel will have ninety days from the release of these
    reasons to perfect the fresh evidence application.  By perfect, I mean that
    all affidavits and any other material that will be relied on by the appellant
    in support of a fresh evidence application shall be served on the respondent
    and filed with this court within ninety days of the release of these reasons.  I
    will assume case management responsibility for the appeal.</p>
