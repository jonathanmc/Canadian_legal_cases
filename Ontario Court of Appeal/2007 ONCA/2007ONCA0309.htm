style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Stelmaszynski, the appellant, and his two companies were convicted of two
    counts of wilfully obtaining refunds under the <i>Excise Tax Act</i>, R.S.C.
    1985, c. E-15 by claiming false tax credits on GST returns filed by the companies
    (counts 1 and 3).  The appellant and his companies were also convicted of
    two counts of attempting to obtain refunds to which they were not entitled
    (counts 2 and 4).  The appellant was sentenced to thirty months in jail and
    fined $702,646.59.  The fines were equal to the total of the refunds referred
    to in the four counts of the indictment.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant appeals his conviction and sentence.  Technically, it would appear
    that the appeal is brought only by Mr. Stelmaszynski; it is acknowledged,
    however, that the corporate accused were entirely under his control.  Their
    liability thus depends on his liability.  </p>
  <h4>The Conviction Appeal</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant, through his companies, attempted to acquire three properties.  He
    wanted to develop upscale condominium projects on these properties.  Ultimately,
    he purchased only one of these properties and none of the projects proceeded
    to development.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Through
    a number of sole proprietorships, the appellant billed his companies $10
    million for work allegedly done in connection with the acquisition and development
    of the properties.  These invoices contained a GST component which reflected
    the GST charge to the companies for the services allegedly performed by the
    appellant’s sole proprietorships.  Although the appellant’s companies did
    not pay these invoices and consequently his sole proprietorships did not
    remit any of the GST to the government, the companies claimed a refund for
    the GST component of the invoices.  Over the two-year time period covered
    by the indictment, the appellant’s companies received about $670,000 in GST
    refunds.  The two attempt counts related to an additional sum of about $30,000
    in refunds sought by the appellant but not paid by the government.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown argued at trial that although the appellant had done some work in connection
    with the proposed developments, the invoices submitted by him in support
    of the refund claims were fraudulent because they claimed for work not done
    or grossly overvalued the work the appellant had done.  The Crown contended
    that the appellant submitted false invoices on a monthly basis to generate
    funds in the form of refund payments which he used to help finance his attempts
    to acquire and develop the properties.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant claimed that the work referred to in the invoices had been done
    and that the rates charged reflected industry practice.  The appellant maintained
    that before he made any claims for GST refunds, he went to the tax office
    in
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hamilton and outlined his operation to tax officials in that office.  He
    said that he was told by them that as long as he performed the work claimed
    in the invoices, he could make the GST refund claims before the companies
    actually paid the invoices.  While it would appear that this advice may not
    have been correct, the Crown’s case did not turn on the appellant’s right
    to make the claim when he did.  Rather, the Crown’s case turned on whether
    the appellant submitted false invoices for work that he either had not done
    or that he had grossly overvalued in the invoices.  The Crown maintained
    that even on the appellant’s version of what the tax officials told him,
    he knew he could not claim for work that he had not done.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    evidence at trial consisted primarily of documents, including hundreds of
    invoices, all of which were filed on consent, Crown accounting summaries
    based on the documentation, the evidence of a Mr. Kleinschmidt, the lead
    investigator for the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) and the appellant’s evidence
    detailing his attempts to acquire the properties and complete the condominium
    developments.  Neither the Crown nor the defence went through all of the
    invoices with the jury.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown led evidence aimed at demonstrating that over a two-year period the
    appellant systematically made monthly refund claims based either on a gross
    over-evaluation of the work he had done or on work he had not done.  For
    example, the Crown led evidence that:</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    invoices contained virtually no detail;</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>several
    different invoices filed by different sole proprietorships controlled by
    the appellant billed for the same work;</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>other
    business and tax records kept and filed by the appellant did not reflect
    any of the income allegedly earned by the sole proprietorships and reflected
    in the invoice amounts;</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>in
    respect of two of the properties, the appellant claimed construction costs
    exceeding $500,000, even though he had not obtained a demolition or building
    permit;</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>in
    respect of the Welland project, the appellant claimed for work valued at
    $430,000.00 in July 1997 despite the fact that his proposal for the development
    of that property had been turned down in June 1997;  and</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    appellant claimed  architectural related costs of $450,000.00.  That work
    was valued at $20,000.00 by an architect who testified at trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his evidence, the appellant offered explanations for the various matters
    relied on by the Crown in addition to attempting to demonstrate the amount
    of work he had done on the projects.  The appellant’s credibility was central
    to his defence.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was initially represented by counsel on the appeal.  Counsel filed
    a factum.  At some point, counsel was dismissed and the appellant filed his
    own detailed factum.  The court has considered the grounds of appeal advanced
    in both the appellant’s and counsel’s facta and found counsel’s factum particularly
    helpful.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant’s factum contains many grounds of appeal.  None have merit and
    most do not require any detailed comment.  The appellant submits that he
    should have been acquitted because the Crown did not prove that the entire
    amount of the refunds referred to in the indictment were in fact paid based
    on false invoices.  In other words, the appellant argues that if the fraud
    was less than the amount alleged, an acquittal should follow.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    amounts alleged in each count in the indictment are not essential elements
    of the offences charged.  The appellant was charged with wilfully obtaining
    or attempting to obtain refunds to which he was not entitled.  The full offence
    and the attempt could be made out regardless of the amount of the fraudulent
    refunds claimed and paid, although the amount of the fraud proved can become
    important on sentencing.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Several
    of the appellant’s arguments are not relevant to any issue in the proceedings.  For
    example, he made submissions as to the proper application of the similar
    fact rule and the law pertaining to criminal negligence.  Neither the similar
    fact rule nor the law of criminal negligence were engaged in this proceeding.
    The appellant also made extensive references to the jurisprudence dealing
    with a trial judge’s obligation to give reasons for judgment.  This was a
    jury trial.  Those cases have no application.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant made submissions concerning the law relating to officially induced
    error.  A stay of proceedings was sought on this basis at trial, post-conviction
    but before sentence.  It would appear that the appellant relies on the advice
    he obtained from the tax officials in
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hamilton in support of his argument that the doctrine of officially induced
    error applies to his case.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    evidence of the advice the appellant received from the tax authorities does
    not give rise to a defence of officially induced error.  It was treated by
    the trial judge as going to whether the appellant “wilfully” claimed a refund
    to which he was not entitled.  The trial judge so instructed the jury.  Indeed,
    it would appear that she gave an instruction that was unduly favourable to
    the appellant.  The trial judge told the jury that it must acquit the appellant
    if he was “merely mistaken in his understanding of when the GST was payable”.  As
    Crown counsel on appeal correctly pointed out, the question of when in law
    the GST was payable was not crucial to the Crown’s allegation.  The Crown
    alleged that regardless of when the GST was payable, or more to the point,
    when the appellant thought it was payable, the appellant had knowingly submitted
    false invoices to obtain a refund on the GST.  If the invoices were false,
    the appellant was not entitled to those refunds regardless of when the GST
    was payable.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge should have given a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning
    in connection with the evidence of Mr. Kleinschmidt.  It was open to the
    appellant to challenge the impartiality of Mr. Kleinschmidt and the manner
    in which he conducted his investigation of the appellant.  There was, however,
    nothing in the record that could reasonably lead to the conclusion that Mr.
    Kleinschmidt’s credibility was so inherently suspect as to necessitate a <i>Vetrovec</i> caution
    in respect of his evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant seeks to introduce fresh evidence on the appeal.  The proposed
    fresh evidence relates to the appellant’s contact in August 1997 with a CRA
    auditor named Mr. Marcaccio.  That contact generated certain internal CRA
    memoranda.  Mr. Kleinschmidt also obtained a witness statement in the form
    of a statutory declaration from Mr. Marcaccio.  Neither the memorandum nor
    the statutory declaration were disclosed to the appellant prior to trial.  In
    its response to the appellant’s fresh evidence application, the Crown has
    filed an affidavit from Mr. Kleinschmidt in which he indicates that he did
    not regard the documents or the statutory declaration as “potentially relevant
    to the proceedings and to the defence”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    light of the broad meaning given to relevance at the disclosure stage, I
    am satisfied that the material described above should have been disclosed
    to the appellant.  I am also satisfied, however, that the failure to disclose
    the material could not possibly have had any effect on the conduct of the
    defence and did not undermine the fairness of the trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is nothing in the proposed fresh evidence to suggest that Mr. Marcaccio had
    any evidence to give that could assist the appellant on the crucial issue
    of whether the invoices were false.  Indeed, it would appear from the material
    that the appellant probably lied to Mr. Marcaccio about the status of the
    projects.  This information could only have further undermined the appellant’s
    credibility.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellant did not suggest at trial that the appellant acted or relied
    on anything Mr. Marcaccio told him.  The appellant acknowledged in his submissions
    in this court that he did not testify at trial that he relied on anything
    Mr. Marcaccio said to him.  He submitted, however, on appeal that Mr. Marcaccio
    had “approved” his claims, including the invoices.  There is nothing in the
    material that offers any support for this contention.  In fact, many of the
    invoices were submitted before the appellant met Mr. Marcaccio.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Consequently,
    although the Marcaccio materials should have been disclosed prior to trial,
    the appellant has not discharged the burden of showing a reasonable possibility
    that the non-disclosure affected the outcome of the trial or the overall
    fairness of the trial process.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    turn now to the grounds of appeal advanced in the factum filed by counsel.  She
    argued that the jury should have been specifically instructed that they could
    draw no adverse inference from the appellant’s failure to offer any explanation
    to Mr. Kleinschmidt when he sought an explanation for the refund claims in
    the course of his investigation.  It was the appellant’s position that he
    co-operated with the tax authorities throughout the process until Mr. Kleinschmidt
    became involved.  He further testified that he was willing to answer Mr.
    Kleinschmidt’s questions, but requested that Mr. Kleinschmidt advise him
    of the nature of his concerns in writing before the appellant attempted to
    answer those concerns.  Mr. Kleinschmidt did not put his questions in writing
    and the appellant did not meet with him.  As counsel properly acknowledged
    in her factum, the defence position that Mr. Kleinschmidt was not impartial
    in his investigation and had not treated the appellant fairly put the dealings
    between Mr. Kleinschmidt and the appellant into issue at trial.  </p>

    the course of the trial judge’s instructions on the <i>mens rea</i> of the
    offences, she told the jury that they could look to the entirety of the appellant’s
    conduct both before and after making the refund claims in determining whether
    he knowingly made claims for refunds to which he was not entitled.  Counsel
    argues that this broad instruction would be taken by the jury as including
    the appellant’s ultimate failure to offer any explanation to Mr. Kleinschmidt.  She
    asserts, quite correctly, that once Mr. Kleinschmidt was engaged in a criminal
    investigation, the appellant was entitled to remain silent.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge could have, and if asked by counsel for the appellant should
    have, made it clear to the jury that the appellant was under no obligation
    to speak to Mr. Kleinschmidt once he was advised that he was the target of
    a criminal investigation.  I agree with Crown counsel, however, that in the
    context of the entirety of the evidence, there is no reasonable possibility
    that the jury would infer anything from the appellant’s refusal to speak
    with Mr. Kleinschmidt.  The appellant offered a reasonable explanation for
    that refusal and I do not understand the Crown to have challenged that explanation.  The
    defence did not request any instruction to the effect that the appellant’s
    refusal to answer Mr. Kleinschmidt’s questions should not be taken as evidence
    against him.  The absence of that request confirms my assessment that the
    appellant’s right to silence was not an issue in the trial.  Neither the
    Crown nor the defence saw this as a case either in which the Crown was attempting
    to make something out of the appellant’s decision not to co-operate with
    Mr. Kleinschmidt or where the jury would draw an adverse inference against
    him based on his failure to co-operate.</p>

    her factum, counsel next argues that the trial judge undermined her initial
    proper <i>W.D.</i> instruction in a subsequent part of her initial charge
    and again in response to a question from the jury.  Counsel submits that
    the trial judge’s reformulation of the burden of proof and the reasonable
    doubt standard withdrew from the jury the possibility of acquitting the appellant
    on the basis that his evidence, while not believed by the jury, left the
    jury with a reasonable doubt.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    would have been better had the trial judge tracked the language of her initial <i>W.D.</i> instruction
    in her subsequent formulation of the reasonable doubt standard as applied
    to the evidence of the appellant.  However, in the initial charge and in
    the trial judge’s response to the jury’s question, she made it clear to the
    jury that the jury must acquit either if it believed the appellant or if
    it had a reasonable doubt based on the entirety of the evidence.  The jury
    would understand that the entirety of the evidence includes the evidence
    of the appellant.  Considering the charge as a whole, I am satisfied that
    the trial judge’s formulation of the reasonable doubt standard as it applied
    to the appellant’s evidence would not have misled the jury in its application
    of the burden of proof to his evidence.</p>
  <h4>The Sentence Appeal</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge correctly told the jury that it could convict even if the amounts
    of the fraudulent invoices “do not match identically with those set out in
    the indictment”.  She told the jury that the amount of the fraudulent refunds,
    if the jury found the claims were fraudulent, was “a matter of law for me
    to deal with”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    sentencing, counsel for the Crown and the appellant proceeded on the basis
    that the convictions indicated that the jury was satisfied that the amounts
    alleged in the indictment had been proved by the Crown.  The trial judge
    proceeded to impose sentence based on the same assumption.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    amount of the fraud is potentially important on sentence for two reasons.  First,
    it goes to whether incarceration is warranted and, if so, the length of that
    incarceration.  Second, the amount of the fraud is essential to a determination
    of the quantum of the fine to be imposed.  Section 327(2) of the <i>Excise
    Tax Act</i> provides for a mandatory fine with a fixed minimum and maximum
    amount based on the amount of the refund sought.  It would appear, although
    I need not finally determine this question, that the “amount” referred to
    in s. 327(2) must refer to the “amount” of the refund that an accused was
    not entitled to claim.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the course of oral argument, the court expressed some concern, given the
    nature of the Crown’s allegations, the evidence adduced at trial, and the
    trial judge’s instruction to the jury, that the trial judge should have made
    a factual finding as to the quantum of refunds to which the appellant was
    not entitled.  It would be difficult, if not impossible, for this court to
    make that finding at this stage.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    am satisfied, however, based on the way this case was put to the jury by
    the Crown and the defence, that the jury’s verdicts indicate that it was
    satisfied that over a two-year timeframe the appellant systematically made
    monthly refund claims based on false invoices as a way of funding his grand,
    but cash starved development projects.  Even if not every dollar of every
    refund was attributable to a false invoice, the jury was clearly satisfied
    that the appellant perpetrated a substantial fraud on the public purse.  That
    finding provides ample justification for the jail term imposed by the trial
    judge.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Neither
    counsel for the appellant in her factum, nor the appellant in his own factum,
    took issue with the quantum of the fine.  The trial judge imposed the minimum
    fine assuming that the amounts referred to in the indictment were the proper
    amounts for the purpose of calculating the fine.  It was accepted at trial
    that there was no realistic possibility that the appellant could pay the
    fine.  The trial judge does not appear to have imposed any additional penalty,
    either concurrent or consecutive to the term of imprisonment should the appellant
    not pay the fine.  The amount of the fine appears to be of no practical consequence.  As
    the quantum of the fine was not put in issue on the appeal and appears to
    be of no practical consequence, I see no reason to consider the appropriateness
    of the fine imposed at trial.  </p>
