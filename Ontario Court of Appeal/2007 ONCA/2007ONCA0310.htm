    respondents bought their land on November 26, 2001.  They brought an application
    returnable February 1, 2002, alleging that the only way to access their land
    was by means of a road traversing the appellant’s land.  Accordingly, they
    sought a declaration that the road crossing the appellant’s land “is an access
    road and a common road within the meaning of the <i>Road Access Act of Ontario</i>”,
    and an “injunction restricting the [appellant] from constructing, placing
    or maintaining a barrier or other obstacle of any kind over the said road,
    or otherwise interfering with the passage of the [respondents] and their
    invitees over and along the road”.</p>

    matter came before Poupore J. on April 5, 2002.  He was satisfied that there
    was at least some evidence of a “road” and granted an interlocutory injunction
    requiring the appellant to open the gate he had erected across the road “to
    allow for traditional access only by the traditional users of the road in
    question and their ordinary invitees.”  He also ordered that the road “may
    be maintained by the [respondents] in its traditional state without improvement”
    and ordered it “not be used for any commercial purpose.”  His order was to
    remain in effect until trial or further order of the court.</p>

    April 5, 2002, Poupore J. also made an order on consent “that there be a
    Trial of the issue as set out in paragraph 1(a) of the Application” – that
    is the respondents’ claim for a “declaration that the road crossing the [appellant’s]
    land … is an access road and a common road within the meaning of the<i> Road
    Access Act</i>”.</p>

    this issue was tried, the appellant interfered with the respondents’ access
    by removing a culvert and ploughing portions of a field.  In response to
    the appellant’s actions, the respondents brought a motion for contempt.  On
    March 11, 2003, Gordon J. ordered the culvert replaced and any ploughed portion
    of land to be returned to the original passable conditions.  The parties
    agreed to adjourn the issue of contempt until after the issue in para. 1(a)
    of the application had been tried and decided.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial of the issue came before Meehan J. who granted judgment dated October
    1, 2003, and issued an injunction “granting access under the <i>Road Access
    Act</i> across [the appellant’s land] to the Applicants, Robert Blais and
    Michael Karchie to their property”.  Meehan J. also ordered that the appellant
    “open the gate to allow for traditional access by the [respondents] of the
    road in question and their ordinary invitees.”  On November 20, 2003, Meehan
    J. also found the appellant in contempt and required him to pay the respondents
    as a penalty substantial indemnity costs fixed at $35,000.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If
    the appellant is successful on appeal, then the finding of contempt ought
    to be overturned as he simply would have been trying to enforce his property
    rights against trespassers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would allow the appeal on the basis of the first ground.  The trial judge
    ought not to have granted an injunction when no claim for one was before
    him.  I would therefore set aside the injunction.  I would decline to replace
    the injunction with the relief claimed – a declaration – because in my view,
    the trial judge misunderstood the purpose of the Act.  The trial judge seems
    to have proceeded on the view that the Act preferred the interests of those
    who use access roads to reach and leave their property over the rights of
    property owners.  I would therefore remit the matter to be re-determined
    by another trial judge.  Finally, I would uphold the finding that the appellant
    was in contempt as he failed to obey the interim orders of the court.</p>

line-height:normal'><span>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    1 defines a “road” as “land used or intended for use for the passage of motor
    vehicles.”  An “access road” is defined as a road, other than a public highway,
    on private property “that serves as a motor vehicle access route to one or
    more parcels of land”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    2 prohibits a person from constructing, placing, or maintaining “a barrier
    or other obstacle over an access road” that “prevents all road access to
    one or more parcels of land or to boat docking facilities” except in certain
    enumerated circumstances.  The principal exception is if a person has made
    an application to a judge for an order closing the road and the judge has
    granted the application.  Section 2 requires that a person give ninety days
    notice of an application to close an access road to those who would be deprived
    of motor vehicle access to their land by the road’s closing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    3(1), which was amended in 2001 and became effective on January 1, 2003,
    provides that a judge may grant an order closing a road upon being satisfied
    that its closure is “reasonably necessary to prevent substantial damage or
    injury to the interests of the applicant or for some other purpose in the
    public interest”, or where owners or tenants of land served by the road “do
    not have a legal right to use the road”.  Section 3(2), which was added in
    the amendment of 2001, allows a judge to “impose such conditions on a closing
    order as … are reasonable and just in the circumstances.”</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sections
    4, 5, 7, and 8 are unimportant to this appeal.  They deal with interim closing
    orders, rights of appeal, the offence of knowingly closing a road without
    a judge’s order, and the temporary closing of public forest roads where an
    emergency exists.</p>

    at law and nothing in this Act shall affect any alternative remedy at law
    available to any applicant or other person.”</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Poupore
    J.’s order dated April 5, 2002, ordered “that there be a Trial of the issue
    as set out in paragraph 1(a) of the Application”.  In para. 1(a) of their
    application, the respondents sought a declaration that the road crossing
    the appellant’s land was an access road and a common road.  The respondents’ claim
    for an injunction is found in para. 1(b) of their application and thus beyond
    the purview of Poupore J.’s order and the ambit of the trial.  In the particular
    circumstances of this case I am satisfied that the judge ought to have confined
    himself to determining the issue that had been ordered and came before him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An
    important circumstance is that the trial of the issue in this case was ordered
    on consent.  The parties had jointly decided to proceed by first having the
    court determine whether the passage was an
    “access road” under the Act.  There are obvious reasons why the appellant
    would want to proceed in that way.  Consistent with his position that there
    was no access road, he did not bring a responding application to close the
    road.  His expectation was that the trial judge would only adjudicate with
    respect to the claim in para. 1(a) of the application.  If his position turned
    out to be wrong, and if the judge declared that an access road existed, he
    could then bring an application to close the road that could be heard together
    with the respondents’ claim for an injunction.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, upon finding that an access road existed, the trial judge should
    have confined himself to granting the declaration set out in para. 1(a) of
    the application, which was the only issue that had been placed before him.  By
    going beyond this issue he interfered with how the parties decided to proceed
    and foreclosed the appellant’s opportunity to bring an application to close
    the road before an injunction was issued.  This is sufficient reason, in
    my view, for setting aside the injunction.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is an additional and more substantive reason for setting aside the injunction.  In
    my view, the trial judge erred in principle in analyzing the evidence upon
    which he found that an access road existed.  I would set aside the injunction
    for this additional reason and decline to replace it with the declaration
    that was sought.  The reasons why I take this view are set out in the next
    section.  </p>

line-height:normal'><span>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s finding that an access road existed is a question of mixed
    law and fact that is largely fact driven.  Therefore, it is deserving of
    deference and considerable care must be taken in interfering with it.  Nevertheless,
    appellate intervention is justified if a trial judge disregards or fails
    to appreciate relevant evidence, or errs in the application of relevant legal
    factors: see <i>Equity Waste Management of Canada v. Halton Hills</i> <i>(Town) </i>(1997),
    35 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.).  In this case, appellate intervention is justified
    since the trial judge failed to apply certain legal factors and did not appreciate
    evidence relevant to the application of those factors.  </p>

    there is an access road which, after traversing the property of other landowners,
    enters the appellant’s property from the east and splits into branches.  One
    branch leads south, down to an old saw mill on

    the parties is whether the access road has a third branch extending east
    to west, splitting off the access road on the appellant’s property, traversing
    an open field and an area of bush that straddles the property line between
    the parties’ properties, and continuing onto the respondents’ property.</p>

    the weight and credibility of the evidence and testimony of witnesses is
    well within the purview of the trial judge.  He found an access road existed
    upon accepting the testimony of the respondents, Mr. Chevrier, and Mr. Bishop
    and rejecting the testimony of the appellant’s witnesses.   However, there
    were two matters addressed in the evidence to which the trial judge did not
    attach sufficient significance.  First, that the route had become overgrown
    and, second, that the respondents had taken action to alter the condition
    of the route.  Both of these matters were pertinent to the determination
    of whether a contemporary access road existed.  Had they been considered,
    they may well have led to a different result.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    judge did state that under the Act, persons who use an access road “are not
    entitled to the use the land for their own purposes except to enter or leave
    their property in a motor vehicle.  <i>Whitmell v. Ritchie</i> (1994), 40
    R.P.R. (2d) 165 O.C.A.”.  However, this legal principle has ramifications
    that the trial judge did not seem to appreciate and indeed failed to include
    in his analysis.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    those who use an access road on the land of another do not have the right
    to repair or maintain the road.  Modern statutory interpretation insists
    on reading the words of an Act “in their entire context, in their grammatical
    and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of
    the Act, and the intention of Parliament”: Ruth Sullivan, <i>Sullivan and
    Driedger on the Construction of Statutes</i>, 4th ed. (Markham, Ont.: Butterworths,
    2002) at 1.  There are simply no words in the Act that are capable of being
    construed, in their grammatical and ordinary sense, of bestowing a right
    to enter upon the land of another to repair or maintain an access road.  In
    fact, one might envisage that recognition of such a right would lead to myriad
    disputes such as deciding what repairs are reasonably necessary, determining
    whether there has been damage to the land in the course of road maintenance,
    or questions relating to liability for damage suffered by road users caused
    by repairs made by persons other than the landowner.  Absent some legal right
    in respect of the land, an entry onto and modification of the land of another
    under the rubric of “road repair or maintenance” would be a trespass.  Such
    an entry goes beyond the limited right recognized by this court in <i>Whitmell
    v. Ritchie </i>(1994), 20 O.R. (3d) 424 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  The Act neither expands nor reduces the scope for the acquisition of
    rights of way or easements under the common law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the Act does not place any obligation on a landowner to maintain an access
    road across his or her property.  The Act has no words whose grammatical
    and ordinary sense can be construed to impose an obligation on the landowner
    to incur costs or exert labour for the benefit of his or her neighbours.  Again,
    the recognition of such an obligation could be expected to generate disputes
    regarding the standard of road repair and maintenance, the allocation of
    their costs, and liability for damage allegedly due to lack of repair or
    maintenance.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Act is silent on the subject of the repair and maintenance of access roads,
    except that it does contemplate the expenditure of public money on such roads.  Where
    public money is expended on an access road, it is considered a “common road” under
    the Act.  It is not up to the courts to conjure up a regime to regulate the
    repair and maintenance of access roads that are not common roads.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    since those who use an access road have no right and the landowner has no
    obligation to repair or maintain it, it follows that an access road could,
    through deterioration over time, cease to be a road.  At this point, it is
    worth noting that the Act provides no assurance to those who use and depend
    on an access road that it will continue to be available to them in the future.  To
    the contrary, s. 3 allows the landowner to bring an application to close
    the road.   Section 3 of the Act was amended, effective January 1, 2003,
    to provide that a judge may grant a closing order simply upon being satisfied
    that the owners or tenants who would be deprived of motor vehicle access
    to their land if the road were closed “do not have a legal right to use the
    road”.  This court, in <i>992275 Ontario Inc. v. Krawczyk </i>(2006), 209
    O.A.C. 302 (C.A.), raised and left open the important question of whether
    a judge hearing an application to close an access road retains a discretion
    to refuse the application where one of the circumstances contemplated by
    s. 3 is established.  </p>

line-height:normal'><span>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In

    respondent Mr. Blais agreed that the route across the field could be described
    as “just two tire marks going across an open field”.  He also agreed that
    the route through the bush was only wide enough for an ATV or a small 4x4
    truck.  He indicated concern that his vehicle would be scratched going through
    the bush.  When the respondents first bought the property they used chainsaws
    and buzz saws to clear the overgrowth and cut down what Mr. Blais described
    as
    “plants” as wide as 3 to 4 inches.  This was before they brought their application
    and before any incident with the appellant.  Mr. Blais testified:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='

    that you were worrying about your truck being scratched.</p>

    route over the field, according to Mr. Karchie, was a “very beaten path” and
    through the bush it had “grown in a fair deal”, but it remained obviously
    a road.  Both respondents expressly acknowledged that they had widened the
    road.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    judge did not advert to Mr. Bishop’s testimony that the “old road” had stopped
    being used in the 1940s and had been grown over for the last 40 or 50 years.  Mr.
    Bishop testified that the old road, he had in mind, was not used now except
    once in awhile by people with ATVs.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

    of a road is relevant to the determination of whether an access road exists.  However,
    the question under the Act is whether a road that is used or intended to
    be used by motor vehicles exists contemporarily.  In this case, the trial
    judge placed particular significance on Mr. Bishop’s testimony about the
    historical existence of the road and insufficient weight on his testimony
    that the road had been grown over for the last 40 or 50 years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Bishop’s testimony, when combined with that of Mr. Chevrier who testified
    the bush grows up unless it is kept back and that of the respondents that
    they used buzz saws and chainsaws to clear the overgrowth, called for consideration
    of whether the road that had been there at one time continued to exist contemporarily. </p>

    Chevrier and the respondents’ testimony that they used small 4x4 vehicles
    to reach their land, and Mr. Bishop’s testimony of how the route was occasionally
    used by persons in ATVs, provided only weak evidence of the contemporary
    existence of an access road.  Such vehicles are by their nature capable of
    off-road travel.  Landlocked landowners cannot by acts of trespass, bring
    into being an access road across the land of another. </p>

    addition to not considering the evidence in the light of these legal factors,
    in my view the trial judge placed undue weight on the interests of the respondents
    and their need to reach their landlocked property.  This is illustrated by
    the form and breadth of the injunction he issued, which granted the respondents
    the general right to cross the appellant’s property to reach their own.  The
    appropriate injunction, if one were to be issued, would have been directed
    at the landowner to restrain him from constructing, placing, or maintaining
    a barrier or other obstacle of any kind over the access road except in accordance
    with the<i> Road Access Act</i>.  An injunction of this nature would have
    accorded appropriate recognition of the appellant’s property rights.  As
    this court observed in<i> Krawczyk</i>, <i>supra</i>,<i> </i>at<i> </i>para.
    8, there is no statutory basis for declaring that a road is an access road
    for the benefit of particular parties. </p>

    was not dependent on the trial’s result.  The issue of contempt was whether
    the appellant had breached the interim orders of Justices Poupore and Gordon.  The
    appellant was not entitled to disregard their orders because he believed
    the court would ultimately decide the access road issue in his favour.  He
    was bound to comply with the interim orders as long as they remained in effect.  The
    existence of a civil society governed by the rule of law depends on court
    orders being obeyed: see Jeffrey Miller, <i>The Law of Contempt in Canada</i> (Toronto:
    Carswell, 1997) at 13-17, 85-99; Nigel Lowe &amp; Brenda Sufrin, <i>Borrie

    suggestion the appellant was in technical compliance with the court’s orders

    deliberate acts were calculated to circumvent the judicial process.  If,
    as he feared, the respondents intended to use the road for heavy commercial
    vehicles in breach of the interim orders, he should have resorted to the
    legal process and not taken matters into his own hands.  As discussed above,
    a primary purpose of the Act is to prevent landowners from resorting to self-help
