    appellants seek to set aside the judgment of Kealey J., dated May 27, 2005,
    (a) dismissing their claim for a $100,000 abatement in the purchase price
    for property acquired from the respondent, and (b) allowing the respondent’s
    counterclaim for pre-judgment interest on the purchase price during the period
    of delay in closing.  The dispute arises out of an erroneous description
    of the size of the property being purchased.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    March 18, 2002, the parties entered into an Agreement of Purchase and Sale – the
    appellants as Purchasers and the respondent as Vendor – with respect to lands
    described as “Block 59, Plan 4M-916, City of Gloucester, now City of Ottawa,
    being approximately 98,950 square feet as outlined on [a Schedule] attached”.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  The purchase price was $680,000.  After the Agreement
    was executed, but before the date fixed for closing, it was discovered that
    this description was erroneous.  The Vendor did not have title to all of
    the lands described.  It owned only <u>part</u> of Block 59 Plan 4M-916,
    measuring approximately 86,745 square feet (about two acres) – a difference
    of about .26 acres, or 12%.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties agree that the misrepresentation respecting the area of land to be
    conveyed was an innocent mistake; there is no suggestion of any intentional
    deceit on the part of the Vendor.  The origins of the mistake lie in the
    documents prepared by the Vendor’s agent in connection with the listing of
    the property.  The Listing Agreement described the lands as “Block 59 R.P.
    4M-916”.  The Vendor did not own the whole of Block 59, however; it owned
    Block 59 <u>except</u> Parts 1 and 2 on Plan 4R12988 in the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ottawa (as described above).  The Vendor’s listing materials again portrayed
    the legal description as “Block 59, Plan 4M-916” and described the size of
    the lands as “2.26 acres or 98,590 square feet”.  This error was simply carried
    through from draft to draft until it found its way into the Agreement of
    Purchase and

    the physical boundaries of the lands were readily identifiable on viewing
    the property, Mr. Gauthier – the principal of the appellant, 3999581 Canada
    Inc. – testified at trial that he could not determine what the square footage
    of the lands was by standing in the field.  He said that he relied upon the
    documents obtained from the Vendor’s agent with respect to the legal description
    and land size, and that the offered purchase price was based on the square
    footage of the land and its intended use as a townhouse development.  His
    evidence on this latter point was corroborated by the Purchaser’s architect
    and by its Director of Land Development.  None of this testimony was contradicted
    at trial.</p>

    Purchasers discovered the misrepresentation after engaging engineers and
    architects to begin surveying and laying out site plans.  Instead of the
    62 units it expected to be able to erect, the Purchaser learned it would
    only be able to erect 54.  They nonetheless decided to complete the transaction
    for the lands the Vendor could convey, and sought to do so with an abatement
    of the purchase price in the amount of $103,875 (consisting of a reduction
    of $83,875 calculated on the basis of the percentage reduction in the size
    of the property, plus $20,000 for costs thrown away).<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    May 21, 2002 the Purchasers registered a Caution against the lands.  On July
    8 they waived all conditions under the Agreement in their favour and proposed
    a closing date of August 7, 2002, seeking at the same time confirmation that
    the Vendor would agree to an abatement of the purchase price.  On July 9
    the Vendor confirmed the August&nbsp;7 closing date but advised that it was
    not prepared to agree to an abatement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the Purchasers issued a statement of claim on July 16, 2002, claiming specific
    performance and an abatement of the purchase price.  They obtained a Certificate
    of Pending Litigation which was registered on title on July 23, 2002.  Negotiations
    followed, but no settlement was reached.  The closing date was extended by
    agreement to August 15, at which time the parties tendered on each other.  The
    transaction did not close.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Vendor defended the action and counterclaimed for an amount representing
    interest on the purchase price from the original date of closing, August
    15, 2002, until the actual closing date (the transaction eventually closed
    on February 27, 2004).</p>

    the tender, the Vendor moved to have the Certificate of Pending Litigation
    discharged on the grounds that the Purchasers had made inadequate disclosure
    and that the Purchasers had no reasonable claim to an interest in the lands.  Rutherford
    J. dismissed this motion on November 1, 2002.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later,
    however – in January 2004 – each party brought motions that resulted in an
    order of considerable significance for the trial and this appeal.  The Vendor
    sought again to discharge the Certificate of Pending Litigation (this time
    on grounds of delay) and in addition claimed certain relief regarding the
    Purchaser’s affidavit of documents and answers to undertakings.  The Purchaser
    sought to have the appellant 1514594 Ontario Inc. added as a plaintiff in
    the action.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Kealey
    J., sitting as a motions judge, heard the motions.  On January 15, 2004,
    he made orders adding the party plaintiff and requiring that undertakings
    be answered, and all pre-trial proceedings be completed, by February 29 and
    that the action be set down for trial immediately.  More importantly, he
    did not order that the Certificate of Pending Litigation be discharged outright.  Instead,
    he ordered that “<u>the real estate transaction</u> in question in this action <u>shall
    close</u> on or before February 29, 2004” (my emphasis), subject to the Purchaser
    paying the purchase price plus property taxes from the original closing date,
    with the usual adjustments, and subject to the sum of $100,000 being withheld
    from the purchase price and paid into court to the credit of the action.  Only
    if the transaction failed to close as a result of fault on the part of the
    Purchasers was the Certificate of Pending Litigation to be discharged.</p>

line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Kealey
    J. also ordered that the parties were to identify the issues to be tried
    in the action and, failing agreement, were to ask the Court to specify those
    issues.  No such motion was brought.  Counsel agreed that the issue to be
    tried was whether the Purchasers were entitled to an abatement of the purchase
    price. In this appeal, counsel also agreed that this was the issue that was
    tried in the proceeding below.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Kealey
    J. tried the case over two days in March 2005, and released his decision
    on May 27, 2005.  He dismissed the Purchasers’ claim for an abatement and
    granted judgment in favour of the Vendor on the counterclaim, awarding the
    Vendor damages in the amount of $58,636.03 for the delay in closing between
    August 15, 2002 and February 27, 2004.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respectfully,
    in my view, the trial judge erred in his application of the law pertaining
    to the circumstances in which specific performance with an abatement of the
    purchase price may be ordered in favour of a purchaser where the vendor is
    unable to convey the whole of what the vendor has agreed to convey.  In addition,
    the trial judge’s finding that the land in question “was immediately identifiable <i>and
    quantifiable </i>by the most casual inspection because of its observable
    and obvious boundaries” (my emphasis) is contrary to the evidence.  Because
    this finding is pivotal to the respondent’s equitable argument and to the
    exercise of the trial judge’s discretion it is both “palpable” and “overriding” and
    cannot be allowed to buttress the decision not to allow an abatement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the case of a contract for the sale of land, where there is a discrepancy
    between what the vendor has agreed to convey and what the vendor can convey,
    the rule is that a purchaser is generally entitled – if the purchaser is
    otherwise entitled to specific performance, and so elects – to specific performance
    of the contract with an abatement in the purchase price.  This has been the
    law since at least the decision of <i>Mortlock v. Buller</i> (1804), 10 Ves.
    292, 32 E.R. 857 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Ch.</st1:country-region>
    ).
     In that case, at 315-16 (Ves.), Lord Eldon L.C. said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I also agree,
    that, if a man, having partial interest in an estate, chooses to enter into
    a contract, representing it, and agreeing to sell it, as his own, it is not
    competent to him afterwards to say, though he has valuable interests, he
    has not the entirety; and therefore the purchaser shall not have the benefit
    of his contract.  For the purpose of this jurisdiction, the person contracting
    under those circumstances, is bound by the assertion in his contract; and, <i>if
    the vendee chooses to take as much as he can have, he has a right to that,
    and to an abatement; and the Court will not hear the objection by the vendor,
    that the purchaser cannot have the whole</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>          See
    also<i>

line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court and the Supreme Court of Canada have adopted the same approach.  In
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <i>Ontario</i><i> Asphalt Block Co. v. Montreuil</i> (1913), 29 O.L.R. 534
    at 545-46 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), Meredith C.J.O. (speaking for the court) enunciated the rule in this fashion:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Ordinarily,
    where the vendor is unable to convey the whole of the land which he has contracted
    to sell, the purchaser has two courses open to him:  either to refuse to
    complete the purchase, in which case he may sue for damages; or to require
    the vendor to convey that to which he can make title and to submit to a proportionate
    reduction or abatement of the purchase-money in respect of the remainder
    of the land.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[…]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The rule applicable
    where the other course is taken [i.e., the second option above] is nowhere,
    as far as I am aware, more clearly, or, as I think more correctly, stated
    than in the following passage from the Cyclopaedia of Law and Procedure,
    vol. 36, p. 740: “Although the purchaser cannot have a partial interest forced
    upon him, yet if he entered into the contract in ignorance of the vendor’s
    incapacity to give him the whole, <i>he is generally entitled to have the
    contract specifically performed as far as the vendor is able, and to have
    an abatement out of the purchase-money for any deficiency in title, quantity,
    or quality of the estate.”</i>  [Emphasis added.]</p>

    was dismissed for the reasons given by Meredith C.J.O. in this court: (1916),
    52 S.C.R. 541.  See also <i>LeMesurier v. Andrus</i> (1986), 54 O.R. (2d)

line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court has also held that it is not necessary as a matter of law for a purchaser
    to quantify the amount of the abatement and to offer to close the transaction
    subject to paying the specified amount of the abatement into court as a condition
    of proceeding with the claim for specific performance and an abatement and
    resisting the vendor’s attempt to remove the agreement from title: <i>Capital
    Ventures Group Inc. v. Vulcan Packaging Inc.</i> (1990), 71 O.R. (2d) 554

line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    quantum of the abatement is generally calculated on the basis of a pro-rata
    reduction in the purchase price based on the amount of land that cannot be
    conveyed: <i>Ontario Asphalt, supra</i>, at 547-58; <i>Khanna v. Mysko</i>,
    [1993] O.J. No. 2697 (Gen. Div.), aff’d [1995] O.J. No. 2614 (
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  Here, Kealey J. adopted that approach and there is no issue on this appeal
    about the quantum of the abatement, calculated at $83,848 on the following
    basis:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>$680,000 ÷

    Sale contained the standard provision regarding title, requisitions and termination
    of the agreement.  Article 10 makes it a condition of the Agreement that
    the Vendor convey a title to the property that is good and free from all
    restrictions, charges, liens, and encumbrances except as provided for in
    the Agreement (a list of specific exceptions is outlined), and then continues:</p>

    Respondent relies heavily on this provision, which Mr. Augustine referred
    to as the “anti-abatement” clause.  He submits that there was a valid defect
    in title (the Vendor could not convey everything it had agreed to convey),
    that the Purchasers insisted on closing, but subject to an abatement of the
    purchase price, and that the Vendor insisted on closing without any such
    abatement.  Thus there was a defect in title that the Vendor was unable to
    remedy and the effect of Article 10 was to entitle it to treat the Agreement
    of Purchase and Sale as terminated and to limit the Purchasers remedy to
    the return of their monies without interest: see Paul M. Perell,
    “Specific Performance with an Abatement” (2001), 41 R.P.R. (3d) 302.</p>

    agree that Article 10 is an “anti-abatement” clause in the sense that, in
    the circumstances contemplated therein, neither vendor nor purchaser can
    be compelled to close and accept an abatement of the purchase price.  In
    my opinion, however, Article 10 does not assist the Vendor in the circumstances
    of this case.  It can have no application where the transaction has closed
    and title has passed.  </p>

    the provisions of Article 10 were neither pleaded nor argued at trial and,
    indeed, the Vendor did not seek to rely upon them in relation to the transaction.  Quite
    the contrary, the Vendor wanted to close the transaction and did so.  It
    gave up the property but remained adamant that no abatement would be conferred.  That
    is not what Article 10 envisages.  At page 308, Mr. Perell sums up his view
    of the law respecting claims for an abatement in the context of the termination
    clause in this way:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…[A] party may
    have a claim for an abatement if the party has a viable claim for specific

line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,

    respondent contends that where a purchaser is aware of the boundaries of
    the property being acquired, and those boundaries are obvious on a casual
    inspection – as is the case here – and where the purchaser offers a bulk
    sum for the property not based on area or frontage or depth, the purchaser
    is not entitled to specific performance with an abatement: <i>Wilson Lumber
    Co. v. Simpson</i> (1910), 22 O.L.R. 452 (H.C.J.); <i>Gray v. Chadwick</i> (1922),
    49 N.B.R. 144 (N.B.S.C.).  </p>

    would not give effect to this argument.  In <i>Wilson Lumber</i> the lands
    were described as “having a frontage on
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Richmond Street of 36 feet, more or less, and a depth of 110 feet, more or
    less, to a lane”.  The court held that the vendor was in effect able to convey
    what it had agreed to convey.  Here, the qualifying word is “approximately”
    and no one argues the Vendor’s inability to convey twelve per cent of what
    it agreed to convey falls within that qualification.  Moreover, as I have
    noted above, the trial judge’s finding that the lands were easily quantifiable
    by casual inspection is contrary to the evidence.  In addition, while the
    Agreement of Purchase and Sale does not say specifically that the purchase
    price was calculated on the basis of acreage or square footage, it clearly
    contemplates that the property to be sold had an area of approximately 98,590
    square feet, and the uncontradicted evidence of the appellants is that their
    offer price was based on the square footage of the land and its intended
    use as a townhouse development.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    record demonstrates that the professed acreage of the property was a significant
    factor in both the appellants’ decision to acquire the property and in the
    calculation of the price they were willing to pay.  The trial judge made
    no finding to the contrary.  Accordingly, this is not a case of a contract
    for the purchase of land for a gross or bulk sum, as was the situation in
    the authorities cited above.</p>

    performance.  Like the Respondent’s Article 10 argument, however, the submission
    that the Appellants are not entitled to specific performance in the circumstances
    of this case has been overtaken by the closing of the transaction which took
    place following the order of Kealey J. on January 15, 2004.  That order directed
    that the transaction “<u>shall close</u> on or before February 29, 2004,” subject
    to the sum of $100,000 being paid into court out of the purchase monies pending
    disposition of the issues subsequently to be tried.  It was tantamount to
    an order granting specific performance to the Purchasers.  Counsel agree
    that the only issue addressed at trial in this regard was whether the Purchasers
    were entitled to an abatement of the purchase price.  The trial thus proceeded
    on the premise that the Purchasers were entitled to specific performance.  The
    only question was whether it was specific performance with an abatement of
    the purchase price (the Appellants’ position) or specific performance without
    such an abatement (the Respondent’s position).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Specific
    performance with an abatement is an equitable remedy.  Consequently, even
    though the general rule – as set out in <i>Ontario Asphalt </i>and related

    performance with an abatement (absent Article 10 considerations), the court
    reserves a residual discretion whether to grant an abatement or not.  The
    Respondent accordingly argues that the trial judge was correct in declining

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    thrust of the trial judge’s rationale for finding that an abatement was not
    an  appropriate remedy in the circumstances of this case is found in the
    following paragraphs of his reasons (touching, in some respects, on the points
    put forward on behalf of the Respondent above):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[5]  A review
    of the learned authors and many cases cited by the parties, leads me to conclude
    that the following general principles are applicable to this type of case.  Specific
    performance with an abatement of the purchase price will not likely be available
    as a remedy where the deficiency is so trivial as to come within the ambit
    of the words “more or less”; nor will it be granted where the deficiency
    is so large or significant that the court is effectively rewriting the parties’ contract.  <i>As
    well, the courts are more reluctant to grant specific performance with an
    abatement of the price to a purchaser than to a vendor</i>, because to do
    so would give the former exactly what it wished to acquire for less consideration,
    whereas the latter is forced to perform a contract which it did not enter.  However,
    in circumstances where the vendor has made a material representation as to
    title or the quantity of land, <i>the court’s concern in granting the remedy
    will sometimes be ignored</i>.  Thus, if expressed contractual provisions
    “guaranteeing” title or acreage are found, the court in many cases invokes
    such findings and permits the remedy <i>despite having to rewrite the contract</i>.  The
    same is true of representations made in a collateral contract.  Furthermore,
    the court will sometimes order specific performance with an abatement where
    the error involves a “gross mistake” going to the “root of the contract” or
    affecting “the essence of the deal”.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[6]  The case
    before me falls far short of those which would incline the Court to exercise
    its discretion to order an abatement.  Even without deciding the issue of
    whether the current owner plaintiff has suffered any loss in view of the
    discounted purchase price, which was paid to acquire the subject land, it
    seems to me that the plaintiffs want to “have their cake and eat it too”.  The
    circumstances here do not involve a
    “guarantee”, and there is no dispute that the vendor’s misrepresentation
    of the square footage being sold was an innocent mistake.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[7]  The record
    discloses that the land in question was immediately identifiable and <i>quantifiable
    by the most casual inspection because of its observable and obvious boundaries</i>.  The
    plaintiffs had the opportunity to rescind their offer and avoid the transaction
    if they so wished upon learning of the shortfall in the land size.  Instead
    they sought to abate the purchase price and at the same time avoided closing
    the deal by the registration of a certificate of pending litigation.  Indeed
    they have gained the benefit of the appreciation in value of the defendant’s
    property from 2002 to 2004.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respectfully,
    there are at least two errors in those passages – one legal and one factual – which
    are significant for the purposes of this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the statement that “the courts are more reluctant to grant specific performance
    with an abatement of the price to a purchaser than to a vendor” – reinforced
    by the reference to “the court’s concern in granting the remedy [to a purchaser]” – is
    wrong in law.  Indeed, the opposite is the case: courts will more readily
    grant specific performance with an abatement to a purchaser than to a vendor.  As
    noted by Viscount Haldane in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Rutherford</i><i> v. Acton-Adams, supra</i>, at 870<b>:</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>If it is the
    purchaser who is suing <i>the Court holds him to have an even larger right</i>.  Subject
    to considerations of hardship he may elect to take all he can get, and to
    have a proportionate abatement from the purchase money. [Emphasis added.]</p>

line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    statement was adopted by this court in <i>LeMesurier v. Andrus,</i> <i>supra,</i> at
    5<b>.  </b>See also <i>Bowes v. Vaux</i> (1918), 43 O.L.R. 521 (Ont. H.C.)
    and Victor Di Castri, <i>The Law of Vendor and Purchaser: T</i><i>he Law
    and Practice Relating to Contracts for Sale of Land in the Common Law Provinces
    of Canada</i>, 3d. ed. (looseleaf) (Toronto: Carswell, 1988) at para. 256.  Moreover,
    contrary to the view of the trial judge, and as noted in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Ontario</i><i> Asphalt, supra</i>, at 546:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>“This is not,”

    the finding that “the land in question was immediately identifiable <i>and
    quantifiable</i> by the most casual inspection because of its observable
    and obvious boundaries”
    is contrary to the evidence.  The lands were identifiable by their boundaries,
    but not quantifiable.  As noted above, the evidence was uncontradicted in
    this respect, as was the testimony that the Purchasers relied upon the represented
    square footage of the land in developing the price they offered.  The Agreement
    of Purchase and
    <st1:place

line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    the trial judge approached the exercise of his equitable discretion to grant
    an abatement from a legal perspective that was the reverse of the attitude
    favoured by the courts (that is, the courts approach purchasers’ claims for
    an abatement more favourably than those of vendors, not the reverse) and
    based upon a crucial factual underpinning that was misplaced.  These errors
    sufficiently undermine the exercise of his equitable discretion, in my view,
    that his decision in that regard cannot stand.</p>

    wanted to complete it, the Vendor was not prepared to close with an abatement
    and the Appellant 3999581 was not prepared to close without one.  The Respondent
    submits that as a consequence of 3999581 registering a Certificate of Pending
    Litigation against the property, together with the delay in the process of
    the action, the Respondent was not able to access its capital asset (its
    property) or the proceeds of the sale from August 15, 2002 until February

    there is no evidence that the Vendor was ever prepared to close the transaction
    with the disputed funds representing an abatement being paid into court prior
    to the motion judge’s order.  Thirdly, there is no evidence on the record
    as to which of the parties was responsible for the delay in moving the case
