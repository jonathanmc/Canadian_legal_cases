    is an investment corporation.  During the taxation years in question, it
    held investments in marketable securities, joint ventures and limited partnerships.  In
    the late-1980s it held a 99.48 per cent interest in a limited partnership
    called Celebrity Place LP, which had been formed to develop a residential
    condominium complex in

    s. 61(5) of the CTA, the taxable paid-up capital of a corporation includes
    the corporation’s proportionate share of the paid-up capital of any partnership
    in which the corporation has an interest.  The partnership is treated as
    if it were a corporation.  Sections 61(5)(a) and (b) provide:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(5) For the purpose of subsection (1), the paid-up
    capital of the corporate partners of a partnership shall, with respect to
    their interests in the partnership, be determined in accordance with the

    FCMI filed its corporate tax returns for 1988 and 1989, it failed to include
    any amount of paid-up capital for its interest in Celebrity Place LP.  The
    Minister discovered this omission during a tax audit of FCMI in 1994.  He
    reassessed FCMI to include as part of its taxable paid-up capital, its share
    of
    <st1:Street w:st="on">

    <st1:Street w:st="on">

    Celebrity Place’s year end.  For FCMI’s 1988 taxation year, he used
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Celebrity Place’s December 31, 1987 financial statement, and for FCMI’s 1989

    objected.  It asked to use its own fiscal year end.  It had prepared and
    given to the Minister revised financial statements, which calculated FCMI’s
    taxable paid-up capital for 1988 and 1989 using financial statements of Celebrity
    Place as at October 31 in each of the two years.  Using October 31 was economically
    advantageous for FCMI because it had disposed of a substantial portion of
    the partnership’s property between December 31, 1987 and October 31, 1988,
    and again between December 31, 1988 and October 31, 1989.  These dispositions
    materially reduced FCMI’s taxable paid-up capital arising from its interest
    in
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Celebrity Place.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Minister, however, would not accept FCMI’s position.  He contended that previously
    for its interest in partnerships, FCMI had used the partnership’s year end.  It
    could not now pick a different year end simply to gain a tax advantage.  FCMI
    appealed the Minister’s decision, and this became the main issue before the
    trial judge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge concluded that the Minister had erred in refusing to permit FCMI
    to use its own fiscal year end to calculate its taxable paid-up capital arising
    from its interest in
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Celebrity Place.  I agree with the trial judge’s conclusion.  In my view,
    his conclusion is supported by the language of the statute, as well as an
    interpretation bulletin published by the Corporations Tax Branch of the Ministry
    on how a corporation should calculate its taxable paid-up capital when it
    has an interest in a partnership and the partnership year end differs from
    its own year end.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    3(1) of the CTA sets out the basic rule for calculating a corporation’s capital
    tax: unless the statute provides otherwise, the corporation is to use its
    fiscal (taxation) year end.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(1) Unless otherwise provided in this Act, any tax
    imposed by this Act shall be determined on the amount of the paid-up capital
    or other subject in respect of which the amount of the tax is to be ascertained
    as such paid-up capital or other subject stood at the close of the taxation
    year of the corporation for which the tax is imposed.<a

'>[2]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>Thus, if s. 3(1) governs, FCMI’s
    position is consistent with the statute.  That leaves the question whether
    the CTA otherwise provides.  The Minister argues that it does otherwise provide
    in s. 61(5), and he also argues that s. 249 of the <i>Income</i> <i>Tax</i> <i>Act</i>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.), supports his interpretation.  I do not agree.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    convenience I reproduce ss. 61(5)(a) and (b) of the CTA:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(5) For the purpose of subsection (1), the paid-up
    capital of the corporate partners of a partnership shall, with respect to
    their interests in the partnership, be determined in accordance with the
    following rules:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(a) determine the paid-up capital of the partnership
    as if it were a corporation;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(b) allocate the paid-up capital of the partnership
    as determined under clause (a) to each partner thereof in the same proportion
    as the share of the profits to which the partner is entitled under the partnership
    agreement;</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Minister submits that s. 61(5) directs FCMI to calculate its paid-up capital
    arising from its interest in
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Celebrity Place at the end of
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Celebrity Place’s taxation year.  I do not read s. 61(5) that way.  To me,
    it is a provision that addresses computation, not timing.  And, if it addresses
    timing at all, it is arguably more plausible to read s. 61(5) in a way favourable
    to FCMI’s position.  Section 61(5)(a) directs FCMI to determine its paid-up
    capital arising from its interest in Celebrity Place as if Celebrity Place
    were a corporation.  As that is so, it makes sense to determine the paid-up
    capital of a partnership at the same point in time – here October 31 – as
    that of the corporation that must pay the capital tax.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Since
    s. 61(5) seems to address computation not timing, or at least does not yield
    a clear answer to which year end should be used, the basic rule in s. 3(1)
    should govern.  Thus, FCMI is justified in calculating its share of paid-up
    capital in
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Celebrity Place as at October 31.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    I do not think that the <i>Income Tax Act</i> advances the Minister’s position.  Section
    1(1)(a) of the CTA does make certain provisions of the <i>Income Tax Act</i> and
    their interpretations applicable to the CTA.  The Minister relies on s. 249(1)(a)
    of the <i>Income</i> <i>Tax Act</i>, which defines a “taxation year” in the
    case of a corporation, as its fiscal period.  So the Minister says that if
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Celebrity Place is to be treated as a corporation, its taxation year must
    be its fiscal period, that is the period ending December 31 of each year.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    s. 249 as well as s. 96(1)(b) of the <i>Income Tax Act</i> – which stipulates
    that where a taxpayer is a member of a partnership, the taxpayer’s income
    shall be computed as if the taxation year of the partnership were its fiscal
    period –
    are specifically directed to the calculation of a taxpayer’s income for the
    purpose of paying income tax.  They cannot be imported into s. 61 of the
    CTA for the purpose of calculating an entirely different tax: capital tax.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Perhaps
    because the calculation of a corporation’s capital tax where the corporation
    had an interest in a partnership was unclear, the Corporations Tax Branch
    of the Ministry published an interpretation bulletin to assist corporations.  Interpretation
    Bulletin L-16, “Capital Tax 1981 Budget Changes and Administrative Policy
    Update” (24 November 1981), addresses the very situation FCMI confronted:
    how to calculate its taxable paid-up capital where the fiscal year of the
    partnership in which it has an interest does not coincide with its own taxation
    year.  In such a case, the Branch prefers that the corporation use a partnership
    balance sheet as at the corporation’s taxation year end, but will accept
    a balance sheet as at the partnership’s year end.  Interpretation Bulletin
    L-16 reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>When the fiscal year of the partnership does not
    coincide with the taxation year of the corporate partner, the Branch’s policy
    has been to accept the partnership’s financial statements at the date closest
    to the taxation year end of the corporate partner (see Interpretation Bulletin
    Number L-7R) where financial statements coinciding with the corporation’s
    year-end were not prepared.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>For taxation years ending after May 19, 1981, a
    corporation should include in its taxable capital for a year its share of
    partnership taxable liabilities for those partnerships whose year-end falls
    within the taxation year of the corporation.  For example, a partnership’s
    fiscal year may run from April 1, 1981 to March 31, 1982 whereas the corporate
    partner’s taxation year may end on December 31, 1981.  The Branch would prefer
    a partnership balance sheet as at December 31, 1981, but where this is not
    available, the partnership balance sheet as at March 31, 1981 is acceptable
    for capital tax purposes.  This change in reporting partnerships’ “Liabilities” for
    capital tax purposes will match reporting of partnerships’ income for income
    tax purposes.</p>

    Celebrity Place’s financial statements at its own October 31 year end.  However,
    even if I were to find that those provisions, when read together, result

    of FCMI.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Here,
    FCMI followed the Branch’s preferred option, as described in its interpretation
    bulletin.  It prepared and submitted financial statements for
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Celebrity Place as at its own year end, October 31.  The Minister then said
    that it could not do so.  Respectfully, the Minister’s position makes no
    sense.  FCMI calculated its taxable paid-up capital consistently with what
    the statute and the interpretation bulletin called for.  The Minister was
    wrong to have rejected FCMI’s calculations.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Minister’s real complaint, I expect, is that FCMI has been inconsistent.  In
    previous years it used a partnership year end rather than its own year end.  It
    changed its practice only because of the tax advantages of doing so.  If
    that is the Minister’s complaint then he should challenge FCMI’s previous
    practice.  He had no basis to challenge what FCMI did for 1988 and 1989.  I
    would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p><b><u>Second Issue</u>: Did the trial judge err in permitting FCMI to use
      its income tax reassessments to reduce its paid-up capital for the years
      1984 to 1988?</b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Under
    s. 61(1)(b) of the CTA, a corporation’s paid-up capital includes its earned
    surplus.  Thus, the less a corporation’s earned surplus, the less its taxable
    paid-up capital.  Here FCMI sought to use unpaid income tax reassessments
    to reduce its earned surplus.  However, the Minister refused to permit it
    to do so.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    facts that give rise to this dispute are as follows.  In the years leading
    up to 1982, FCMI accumulated approximately 9.9 million dollars in income
    tax liabilities.  It did not pay this tax.  The federal government issued
    a notice of reassessment for income tax in 1985, and the provincial government
    issued a notice of reassessment in 1986.  In March 1992, FCMI asked to reduce
    its paid-up capital for the years 1984 to 1988 because of the reassessments.  The
    Minister refused and FCMI appealed the refusal.  The trial judge allowed
    FCMI’s appeal, and the Minister now appeals this issue to this court.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Minister refused FCMI’s request for three reasons: first, he said that FCMI’s
    request was out of time and was therefore statute-barred; second, he said
    that a corporation is not entitled to retroactively reduce its earned surplus
    for a taxation year by a later unpaid reassessment; third, he said that until
    the additional income tax assessed is paid, it amounts to a government advance
    or loan to FCMI and therefore, under s. 61(1)(d) of the CTA, is included
    in the corporation’s paid-up capital.</p>
  <h2>(i)        Out of time?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    May 30, 1990, the Minister issued notices reassessing FCMI for capital tax
    for each of the years 1984 to 1988.  On July 9, 1990, FCMI filed notices
    of objection.  These notices were timely but gave no specific reason for
    the objection.  Twenty months later, on March 12, 1992, FCMI for the first
    time requested that its taxable paid-up capital be reduced because of its
    income tax reassessments.  The Minister’s position is that FCMI was barred
    by the statute from making this objection because it did not do so within
    180 days of the assessment, as required by ss. 84(1) and (1.1) of the CTA. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sections
    84(1) and (1.1) state that a corporation must specify its objection with
    supporting facts and reasons.  A general objection does not comply with the
    Act.  These sections provide:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(1) Subject to subsection 92 (3), a corporation
    that objects to an assessment may, within 180 days from the day of mailing
    of the notice of assessment, serve on the Minister a notice of objection
    in the form approved by the Minister.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(1.1) The notice of objection shall,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>clearly
    describe each issue raised by way of objection; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>fully
    set out the facts and reasons relied on by the corporation in respect of
    each issue.  </p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>Under s. 85(2.1) a corporation’s
    right of appeal is also circumscribed by s. 84(1.1).  Section 85(2.1) states:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(2.1) A corporation is entitled to raise by way
    of appeal only those issues raised by it in a notice of objection to the
    assessment being appealed and in respect of which it complied or was deemed
    to have complied with subsection 84 (1.1).  </p>

    these provisions had been in force when the capital tax notices of reassessment
    and notices of objection were issued, then the Minister’s argument would
    have merit.  But they were not.  The requirement for specificity came into
    the statute by amendment in 1997.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    of objection, it met the requirements of the statute then in force.  For
    this reason the Minister’s argument that FCMI’s objection was out of time
    must fail.</p>
  <h2>(ii)      Retroactive reduction?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Minister contends that a corporation’s earned surplus and therefore its paid-up
    capital must be determined at the end of a taxation year.  Additional income
    tax later assessed cannot be used to alter that determination.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Minister acknowledges that, as an administrative concession, he will permit
    a corporation to retroactively reduce its earned surplus for a taxation year
    if the additional income tax reassessment was issued before the end of the
    taxation year and the tax has been paid.  FCMI did not qualify for this administrative
    concession because it did not pay the tax.  Therefore, according to the Minister,
    FCMI was not entitled to reduce retroactively its earned surplus.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge rejected the Minister’s contention.  He held, at para. 19, that
    the Minister had failed to put forward any legislative or regulatory rule
    preventing a retroactive claim:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The respondent has been unable to provide legislative
    or a regulatory rule which would disentitle the appellant from making the
    claim retroactively.  Further, it would seem the Ministry has made several
    administrative concessions in relation to allowing corporations to retroactively
    reassess.  It was the conduct of the government in reassessing the appellant
    that resulted in the appellant’s desire to adjust its earned surplus to reflect
    the actions of the government.  I do not find any reason that would bar allowing
    the appellant to take into consideration the additional income tax assessed
    in deducting the amount of the corporation’s earned surplus under s. 61(1)
    of the C.T.A.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    agree with the trial judge’s analysis and therefore would not give effect
    to the Minister’s argument on retroactivity.</p>
  <h2>(iii)     Government advance or loan?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Under
    s. 61(1)(d) of the CTA, a government advance or loan to a corporation is
    included in the corporation’s paid-up capital.  That section provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(1) The paid-up capital of a corporation for a taxation
    year is its paid-up capital as it stood at the close of the taxation year
    and includes,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>        …</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(d) all sums or credits advanced or loaned to the
    corporation,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(i)    in the case of a corporation incorporated

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(ii)   in the case of a corporation incorporated
    without share capital, by its members,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>directly or indirectly or by any person related
    to any of its shareholders or members, as the case may be, or by any other

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Minister submits that unpaid income tax should be treated as an advance or
    loan by the government to the corporation, and therefore cannot be used to
    reduce the corporation’s taxable paid-up capital.  The trial judge did not
    accept the submission.  He held, at para. 21:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>On a plain reading of s. 61(1)(d), I cannot see
    that advising the appellant that it owes money to the respondent could be
    considered an act of lending.  The respondent simply is advising that pursuant
    to statute the appellant has a financial obligation to pay an amount of money
    to the government.  To me, this is not a loan, but a tax liability created
    by statute.  I am satisfied that the liability for income tax owing is not
    a sum or credit advanced or loaned pursuant to s. 61(1)(d).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    am not persuaded that the trial judge erred in so holding.  As the statute
    does not define “advance” or “loan”, the ordinary meaning of these words
    should prevail: <i>Roth</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 13.  An advance or loan
    connotes a commercial transaction where value is transferred in exchange
    for a debt.  The parties to the transaction intend to create and do create
    a debtor/lender relationship.  Indeed, <i>Black’s Law Dictionary</i>, 8th
    ed., defines “advance” as “[t]he furnishing of money or goods before any
    consideration is received in return.”  And, it defines “loan” as “[a]n act
    of lending; a grant of something for temporary use.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Here,
    the liability imposed on FCMI was created by statute. The parties did not
    intend to establish a debtor/lender relationship.  There was no “furnishing”,
    “act” or “grant”.  In ordinary parlance, we do not think of an income tax
    liability as an advance or loan. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would therefore not give effect to any of the Minister’s three submissions
    on this second issue.</p>
  <p><b><u>Third Issue</u>: Did the trial judge err in holding that FCMI could

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    calculate its 1989 taxable paid-up capital, FCMI first used an unaudited
    financial statement not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles (GAAP).  FCMI relied on this unaudited statement in filing its
    1989 corporate tax return.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>FCMI
    then concluded that the unaudited statement was inaccurate.  It sent to the
    Minister a revised statement, which had been audited and complied with GAAP.  Although
    the Minister acknowledged that the revised statement sought to correct an
    error in the unaudited statement, he contended that FCMI could not rely on
    the revised statement.  He claimed that in filing the revised statement,
    FCMI was trying to artificially reduce its taxable paid-up capital contrary
    to s. 62(10) of the CTA.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge rejected the Minister’s contention.  He expressly found that
    FCMI was not taking steps to artificially reduce its taxable paid-up capital
    but was doing no more than correcting a mistake in its financial statements.  He
    concluded that the Minister was wrong to have refused to allow FCMI to rely
    on the revised statement.</p>

    capital attributable to its interest in Celebrity Place by using financial
    statements as at October 31 in each of these years; or in holding that FCMI
