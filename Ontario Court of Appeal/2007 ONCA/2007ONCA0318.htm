  <h4><span lang=EN-US>MOLDAVER J.A.:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      This
    is a Crown appeal from the respondent White’s acquittal on charges of possession
    of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking, possession of property obtained
    by crime, possession of a prohibited firearm, possession of prohibited ammunition,
    and being an occupant of a motor vehicle in which he knew there was a firearm.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    respondent commenced his trial before Justice Seppi and a jury. Part way
    through the trial, the trial judge withdrew the case from the jury and directed
    that the respondent be acquitted on all counts. She did so following a mid-trial
    ruling in which she determined that the police violated the respondent’s
    rights under s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i> when they seized his cell phone during
    an investigative detention. That was the second <i>Charter</i> breach found
    by the trial judge. The first, found in the context of a pre-trial motion,
    was that the police breached the respondent’s s. 10(a) <i>Charter</i> rights
    when, in the same investigative detention, they informed him of only one
    of the valid reasons for detaining him (driving while prohibited) and not
    the other (engaging in illegal drug activity). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    s. 10(a) ruling did not result in the exclusion of after-acquired evidence
    that the police seized from the respondent and his car and upon which the
    charges against him were based. The same did not hold true following the
    s. 8 mid-trial ruling. In the opinion of the trial judge, the s. 8 breach
    was serious. The police had no right to seize the respondent’s cell phone
    and in doing so, they unlawfully deprived him of his personal property. That,
    combined with the almost simultaneous breach of his s. 10(a) rights, resulted
    in police conduct that the trial judge described as “high-handed and an abuse
    of [their] ancillary powers”. Such conduct was not to be condoned. Hence,
    the after-acquired evidence should not be received; to do otherwise would
    bring the administration of justice into disrepute. Accordingly, the trial
    judge excluded the cell phone and all of the after-acquired evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    primary issue on appeal is whether the trial judge erred in holding that
    the police violated the respondent’s s. 8 <i>Charter</i> rights when they
    seized his cell phone at the beginning of their investigative detention.
    If she erred, then the appeal must succeed. If she did not, then a secondary
    issue for determination is whether she erred in excluding the after-acquired
    evidence that the police seized from the respondent and his car, upon which
    the charges against him were based.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      For
    reasons that follow, I am respectfully of the view that the trial judge erred
    in holding that the seizure of the respondent’s cell phone constituted a
    breach of his s. 8 <i>Charter</i> rights. I am further of the view that even
    if the seizure of the phone did constitute a breach of the respondent’s s.
    8 rights, the trial judge erred in finding that the breach was
    “serious” and that the police acted in a high-handed and abusive manner.
    The most that can be said is that the police made an error in judgment in
    the circumstances. For that, they do not deserve censure. No other basis
    for excluding the after-acquired evidence existed. It follows that the evidence
    needed to convict the respondent, including a loaded .38 calibre handgun
    found under the passenger seat of his car, should have been admitted under
    s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>

lang=EN-US>Findings of the trial judge on the s. 10(a) ruling pertinent to the
      seizure of the respondent’s cell phone</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In
    the context of a pre-trial motion (hereafter referred to as the s. 10(a)
    motion) in which the trial judge found that the police violated the respondent’s
    s. 10(a) rights by failing to inform him of the two lawful purposes for which
    he was being investigated, the trial judge made a number of findings of fact
    that provide a lead-in to the seizure of the respondent’s cell phone and
    the alleged breach of his s. 8 rights occasioned by it. Significantly, in
    the context of the s. 10(a) motion, the respondent testified as to the events
    surrounding his initial detention and subsequent arrest. His evidence differed
    markedly from the testimony given by the two police officers who detained
    and arrested him. In all instances, where the evidence of the officers differed
    from that of the respondent, the trial judge disbelieved the respondent and
    sided with the police. The pertinent facts found by her are as follows.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      On
    the evening of June 12, 2003, Constables King and Smith of the Peel Regional
    Police Plainclothes Unit were on patrol in a troublesome area of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Brampton notorious for all manner of criminal activity, including gun and
    drug-related crimes. Shortly after 6:00&nbsp;p.m., they observed the respondent,
    who was driving a black Acura, pull up to a parking spot close to the front
    door of the Cannonball Strip Club. The respondent remained parked in that
    location while a woman (later determined to be his girlfriend) made three
    separate trips back and forth from the car to the club in the space of six
    minutes. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      After
    the third trip, the respondent’s girlfriend re-entered the club and remained
    inside. The respondent then left and drove to a nearby Petro
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    gas station. The officers followed him in their van. They did so because
    they had just observed what was, in their experience, a “text-book” case
    of someone either buying or selling drugs. As such, they had reason to suspect
    that the respondent was engaged in illicit drug activity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      At
    the gas station, as the respondent pumped gas into his car, the officers
    ran a check on his licence plate.  They learned that the Acura was registered
    to Glenville White and that White was under an order prohibiting him from
    driving.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once
    the respondent paid for his gas, he did not return directly to his car. Instead,
    he took a circuitous route that enabled him to pass the officers’ van and
    look inside it. The officers believed that his conduct was deliberate and
    designed to confirm his suspicion that he was being followed by the police.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    walking past the officers’ van, the respondent returned to his car but he
    did not leave the gas station. He proceeded instead to a Tim Horton’s “drive-through” and
    then returned to the gas station parking lot where he parked his car. He
    got out of his car and began to walk away from the officers towards the street.
    He was speaking on his cell phone at the time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Believing
    that the respondent might be trying to get away, the officers decided to
    stop and investigate him for suspected drug activity and driving while prohibited.
    They got out of their van and as Constable King approached the respondent,
    he overheard the respondent say
    “Yeah, they’re here now”. Constable King immediately identified himself as
    a police officer.  It was at this point that Constable King seized the respondent’s
    cell phone.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  He then asked the respondent if he was Glenville
    White and the respondent replied that he was not; Glenville was his brother
    and the car belonged to Glenville. Constable King then asked the respondent
    to produce his licence and the respondent told him that it was in the car.
    He was asked to retrieve it and the officers followed him to the car. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the car, the respondent opened the driver’s door and leaned across the front
    seat. With his left hand, he opened the glove compartment. As he did so,
    he put his right hand under the passenger seat. That action concerned the
    officers and they put their hands on their guns. At this point, Constable
    Smith noticed a “mickey” bottle of liquor between the driver seat and the
    passenger seat. By this time, the respondent had retrieved his licence and
    turned it over to Constable King. Constable Smith now informed the respondent
    that he had seen “open alcohol” in the car and he was going to charge the
    respondent under the <i>Liquor Licence Act</i> and search him. The respondent
    replied that if he was going to be searched, he had “this” and he pulled
    out two bags of marijuana from his pocket and turned them over to Constable
    King. The respondent was then arrested for possession of a controlled substance
    and advised of his right to counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Constable
    Smith proceeded to search the car. Under the front passenger seat, he found
    and seized a loaded .38 calibre revolver wrapped in a bandana. He also seized
    the “mickey” bottle of alcohol and an electric pocket scale located inside
    the car. Constable King seized $80 Canadian and $30

    s. 10(a) motion was one of several inter-related pre-trial <i>Charter</i> motions
    brought by the respondent. The others involved alleged breaches of his rights
    under s. 9 (arbitrary detention), s. 8 (unreasonable search and seizure of
    the car) and s.&nbsp;10(b) (right to counsel). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    October 11, 2005, the trial judge gave her ruling on the pre-trial <i>Charter</i> motions.
    She found that apart from a s. 10(a) breach (failure to inform the respondent
    of both reasons for his detention) the police did not otherwise violate his <i>Charter</i> rights. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the s. 10(a) breach, the trial judge considered and rejected the
    respondent’s follow-up submission that the after-acquired evidence, seized
    by the police from the respondent and his car, should be excluded under s.
    24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>. In the opinion of the trial judge, that evidence
    was non-conscriptive and trial fairness was not an issue. The police had
    reason to suspect that the respondent was engaged in illegal drug activity
    and that he was also driving while prohibited. Contrary to the submission
    of the respondent, their investigation of the potential driving offence was
    not a ruse to enable them to improperly detain and investigate the respondent
    for his suspected drug activity. In the circumstances, the breach was not
    a serious one. The trial judge’s reasons in this regard are instructive and
    they are reproduced below:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In the case
    at bar, <i>there is credible evidence from the officers that they believed
    Mr. White knew, and Mr. White behaved as if he knew he had been followed
    from the Cannonball and was under police surveillance for drugs</i>. The
    arrest for open liquor was made almost immediately after the detention during
    which the 10(a) <i>Charter</i> violation had occurred.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Though these
    facts do not excuse the breach, they do go to its seriousness, and the effect
    that excluding all the evidence obtained in the process of what I have found
    to be a lawful detention, lawful arrest, and a lawful search and seizure.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>In these
      circumstances, I find the breach was not a serious one in the sense of
      the applicant’s liberty rights being compromised for expediency and effective
      policing. I am satisfied on all the evidence that Mr. White would not have
      acted any differently had the police informed him he was also being detained
      for suspicion of drug trafficking. He would have, in all probability, cooperated
      and gone to retrieve his licence</i>. In all probability he knew as soon
      as the police arrested him for the open liquor that he was caught, and
      they were entitled to lawfully search him and the vehicle. This is evidenced
      by his voluntary production of the marijuana on his person.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In all the circumstances,
    therefore, I conclude that the admission of the items found in the car that
    evening would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. Accordingly,
    the defence application under Section 24(2) is dismissed. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
      s. 8 mid-trial <i>Charter</i> motion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the s. 10(a) ruling, the trial commenced before the jury and the Crown called
    Constables Smith and King to testify. In the midst of Constable King’s cross-examination,
    defence counsel [not Ms. Maunder] questioned him about some of the items
    he had seized from the respondent, including the respondent’s cell phone.
    When asked “when” the phone was seized, Constable King replied that it was
    when he was “first investigating [the respondent] … when I walked up to him
    and he said, ‘They’re here now’”. It was just “shortly after that [that I
    took his phone]”. Defence counsel then asked the Constable “what authority” he
    had to seize the phone. Constable King replied as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    authority – well, as I indicated earlier in my opinion he was being investigated
    for a drug-related offence. That was the initial thing. When he came to my
    car and he looked into my window that made me believe at that point that
    he identified me as a police officer. When I approached him, he was distancing
    himself from his car and he indicated, as I said already, “Yeah, they’re
    here now;” that made me believe that he was talking to someone on the other
    phone that could possibly be involved as well, so as far as the offence taking
    place, I seized it just after that.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the next series of questions, defence counsel established that Constable
    King’s notebook contained no notation about his having seized the respondent’s
    cell phone at the outset of his contact with the respondent. He also confirmed
    that Constable King could not recall exactly what he said to the respondent
    when he took the phone; nor did he recall what he did with it, although he
    thought he “probably just put it in [his] pocket”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    exchange occurred in the afternoon of October 13. Defence counsel did not
    complete his cross-examination of Constable King at that time. On the next
    morning, when the proceedings resumed, defence counsel raised several issues
    with the trial judge in the absence of the jury. One related to the seizure
    of the respondent’s cell phone.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    what can only be described as a tirade, defence counsel referred to Constable
    King’s seizure of the cell phone as “a shocking new development on the <i>Charter</i> front”.
    He pointed to the fact that the seizure was not mentioned in the Constable’s
    notes, nor was it disclosed “on the two previous occasions on which he has
    testified”. Calling the seizure a “clear, unequivocal section 8 breach”
    for which Constable King “had absolutely no lawful authority”, defence counsel
    accused the officer of “robbery”. That kind of conduct, he continued, “would
    shock freedom loving Canadians”. It was “the kind of lawless behaviour” that
    “the <i>Charter</i> [was] meant to prohibit”
    and “given the extreme seriousness of “Constable King’s admission”, defence
    counsel demanded that a “new <i>Charter</i> analysis with respect to s. 8” be
    conducted.</p>

    response to a question from the trial judge as to what he was suggesting,
    defence counsel continued his attack on Constable King and submitted that
    the court should hold an immediate <i>voir dire</i> to address the problem.
    In the course of his submissions, defence counsel said the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>But defence
    counsel is – is arguing it and arguing it in the strongest terms that if – <i>if
    this had ever been disclosed to the defence at any time either on the Charter
    voir dire, either at discovery, either in the officer’s notes, this would
    have been raised in the strongest possible terms. This again is unlawful
    taking and on – on my reading of the law, it amounts to robbery. It amounts
    to someone taking something with absolutely no colour of the right in the
    context of a regulatory search. This is shocking wild-west behaviour, and
    for that reason the court must engage in the analysis</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>

line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Over
    the objection of Crown counsel, the trial judge determined that the defence
    could bring the s. 8 mid-trial motion. In so ruling, the trial judge was
    very much influenced by the fact that she had made her pre-trial ruling on
    the s. 10(a) motion without knowing the “whole circumstances” and in particular, “that
    the phone was … just taken from [the respondent] as he was standing out there
    talking on it and … that’s a major event under the <i>Charter</i>”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    like defence counsel, the trial judge was under the impression (wrongly as
    it turns out) that on the pre-trial <i>voir dire</i>, Constable King did
    not mention the circumstances under which he had seized the respondent’s
    cell phone.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    will become apparent, that mistake was unfortunate. It figured prominently
    in the trial judge’s decision to allow defence counsel to raise the s. 8
    issue in the middle of the trial, something she might not have acceded to
    had she known the true state of affairs. More importantly, it skewed her
    assessment of Constable King’s credibility and his justification for seizing
    the respondent’s phone when he did. As such, the error was serious. Indeed,
    for reasons that follow, I am respectfully of the view that it tainted the
    whole of the trial judge’s s. 8 analysis.</p>

    the respondent turn the phone off and put it in his pocket. Based on his
    experience, Constable King was aware of numerous phones that were designed
    to “appear to be off” but nonetheless continued to “operate as two-way phones”.
    Constable King did concede that when he seized the cell phone, the respondent
    did not put up an argument; he also agreed that when he approached the respondent

    his testimony that officer safety was one of the reasons for seizing the
    phone. His reason for not doing a pat-down search was because the investigation
    moved “so quickly” in a way that made it unnecessary to do so. Within moments
    of the respondent’s apprehension, Constable Smith noticed alcohol in his
    car and he told the respondent that he was going to be searched. It was then
    that the respondent produced drugs … “it moved so quickly. So far as a pat-down

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In the course
    of the Crown’s case, during the cross-examination of Constable Philip King, <i>new
    evidence came to light that materially affects the Charter ruling. Constable
    King, for the first time during the entire course of these proceedings, disclosed
    that he seized Mr. White’s cell phone immediately upon his detention</i>.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    identified the circumstances under which the respondent’s cell phone was
    seized, the trial judge commenced her analysis to determine whether the seizure
    constituted a breach of the respondent’s rights under s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.
    In doing so, she quite properly observed that “the onus of justifying the
    warrantless seizure” rested upon the Crown. Her reasons for concluding that
    the Crown failed to meet its onus and that the respondent’s s. 8 rights were
    violated are relatively brief. They are reproduced in full below:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Officer King
    testified that he took the phone to prevent Mr.&nbsp;White from calling others
    to his aid. He said the words, “Yeah, they’re here now,” made him believe
    Mr. White was calling someone else to the scene. He said he was concerned
    that if others came, officer safety would be compromised. He believed the
    suspicions which arose from the events at the Cannonball Club gave him the
    right to seize the phone. He said he had seen other officers do this in the
    course of detention and has learned the cell phone to be a concern in numerous
    investigations.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>I find there
      were no exigent circumstances justifying a warrantless seizure under Section
      11(7) of The Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. There was no urgency
      to seize the cell phone, nor was there any credible evidence of a threat
      or apprehension that the safety of the officers was at risk because Mr.
      White had a cell phone on his person. Mr. White was totally compliant and
      responsive to the officer’s detention. He made no threatening gestures
      with his phone or otherwise. He did not attempt to run, he showed no inclination
      towards violence. The officer, on his own evidence, perceived no real danger
      or discomfort in the process until later when the accused put his hand
      on the floor of the vehicle</i>. The phone call he was on ended when the
      officer stopped him. There is no evidence he tried to use the phone after
      he was detained.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Taking the phone
    in the manner that he did, when Mr. White had not been told of the reason
    for his detention, was clearly an unreasonable seizure. It was not authorized
    by law nor was it carried out in a reasonable manner. Accordingly, I find
    there was an infringement of Mr. White’s Section 8 <i>Charter</i> rights
    to be secure against unreasonable seizure. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    found a s. 8 breach, the trial judge turned to s. 24(2). In doing so, she
    re-introduced the s. 10(a) breach into the analysis. Hence, the new question
    for determination was whether, in the face of two separate <i>Charter</i> breaches,
    the after-acquired evidence, earlier found to be admissible, should be excluded
    under s. 24(2).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge answered that question in the affirmative. In her view, the “unlawful
    seizure” of the respondent’s “personal property” amounted to a serious breach.
    Considered in the context of all of the circumstances, “the police conduct
    when they stopped [the respondent] was high-handed and an abuse of the police
    ancillary powers”. As such, the
    “cumulative effect of the <i>Charter</i> breaches in this case was most serious”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge next determined that the after-acquired evidence was both temporally
    and causally connected to the breaches. On the latter point, she found that
    the items in the car were located:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>… because of
    the stop, detention and initial questioning which occurred during the <i>Charter</i> breaches.
    The evidence was uncovered because Mr. White entered the vehicle to obtain
    his licence in response to the officer’s initial questions on the investigative
    detention. The events took only a matter of minutes to lead to the discovery
    of the marijuana, digital scale and loaded prohibited firearm.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge found that despite the discovery of a loaded firearm and
    the “very serious nature” of the charges against the respondent, that did “not
    minimize the seriousness” of the <i>Charter</i> breaches. In the circumstances,
    she determined that it would be wrong for the court to countenance such breaches
    by admitting their evidentiary product into evidence. To do so would bring
    the administration of justice into disrepute. Hence, the trial judge excluded
    all of the evidence seized from the respondent and his car under s. 24(2).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Without
    that evidence, the Crown could not succeed. The trial judge accordingly withdrew
    the case from the jury and acquitted the respondent on all counts. In doing
    so, she told the jury that certain evidence introduced at trial:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>… should have
    been excluded due to a serious <i>Charter</i> violation. <i>The facts of
    the violation were not known to either of the lawyers or the court before
    we began the evidence in this trial</i>, which is the reason for the court
    not having dealt with the issue before the trial began. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    is the backdrop against which the Crown brings this appeal. At issue is whether
    the trial judge erred in finding that Constable King breached the respondent’s
    s.&nbsp;8 <i>Charter</i> rights when he seized the respondent’s cell phone
    at the outset of a lawful investigative detention. Alternatively, if the
    trial judge was correct in finding a s. 8 breach, did she err in excluding
    the after-acquired evidence that formed the basis of the charges against
    the respondent.</p>

  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>That
    the parties and the trial judge may have missed that response is unfortunate.
    All the more unfortunate is that it placed Constable King in an unfavourable

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That,
    as I have already intimated, was particularly troublesome in the circumstances.
    Constable King’s justification for seizing the respondent’s cell phone at
    the outset of his involvement with the respondent depended largely on his
    credibility. He was entitled to a fair and just assessment in that regard,
    not one which wrongly placed him under a cloud of suspicion because of his
    supposed failure to disclose the timing of the seizure.</p>

line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, that error alone would justify setting aside the trial judge’s findings
    rejecting Constable King’s reasons for seizing the cell phone when he did.
    But that would mean that the s. 8 issue could be raised again at the new
    trial. I see no need for that.</p>

    the s. 10(a) pre-trial <i>voir dire</i>, the trial judge made critical findings
    of fact that remained undisturbed for purposes of the mid-trial s. 8 motion.
    Had the trial judge applied the correct principles of law to those findings,
    she would, in my respectful view, have concluded that Constable King was
    fully justified in seizing the respondent’s cell phone when he did and that
    he did not violate the respondent’s s. 8 rights in the process. The critical
    facts to which I refer are set out below:</p>

    the evening in question, Constable Smith and King were working in plain clothes
    in a high risk area of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Brampton notorious for all manner of criminal activity, including drug and
    gun related crimes. Their observation of the respondent and his girlfriend
    at the Cannonball Strip Club provided them with reasonable grounds to suspect
    that the respondent was engaged in illegal drug activity. </p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    they followed the respondent for about a block to a nearby gas station, the
    officers observed him taking steps that caused them to believe that he suspected
    he was being followed by the police. By this time, the officers had reason
    to suspect that the respondent was not only engaged in illegal drug activity
    but also, that he was driving while prohibited. Their beliefs were legitimate
    and honestly held, and they provided the officers with two separate bases
    for detaining and investigating the respondent.</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    the officers decided to approach the respondent, he was walking away from
    their vehicle towards the street and he was using his cell phone. As Constable
    King approached and identified himself as a police officer, he overheard
    the respondent say “Yeah, they’re here now”. It was then that he seized the
    respondent’s phone.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Those
    findings were made by the trial judge on the s. 10(a) <i>voir dire</i> and
    they remained undisturbed for purposes of the s. 8 mid-trial motion. Nonetheless,
    the trial judge determined that Constable King was not legally justified
    in seizing the respondent’s cell phone when he did. In so concluding, she
    found, among other things, that there were “no exigent circumstances justifying
    a warrantless seizure” and there “was no urgency to seize the cell phone”.  If
    by that, the trial judge intended to limit the right of seizure to situations
    of immediate danger as opposed to reasonably apprehended potential danger,
    I am respectfully of the view that she erred. Put simply, the police did
    not have to wait to seize the respondent’s cell phone until they were set
    upon by back-up forces summonsed by him. They were entitled to take preventative
    measures.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge continued her analysis noting that there was no “credible evidence
    of a threat or apprehension that the safety of the officers was at risk because
    [the respondent] had a cell phone on his person”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, that misses the point. Constable King did not seize the respondent’s
    cell phone simply because he “had [it] on his person”. He did so because
    the respondent was letting someone know that the police were there. That
    is precisely the kind of information that Constable King was worried about,
    both from the point of view of officer safety and the potential loss of evidence.
    If the respondent had not already done so, Constable King did not want to
    give him the opportunity to provide his cohorts with more information, such
    as the location of the gas station and the number of officers present. Nor
    was he required to do so. If ever there was a case where Constable King was
    justified in seizing the phone to prevent (or attempt to prevent) back-up
    forces, sympathetic to the respondent, from arriving at the scene and imperilling
    police safety and/or obstructing their investigation, this was it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regrettably,
    the trial judge does not appear to have appreciated that. As indicated, she
    seemed to be looking for immediate threats or acts of violence by the respondent
    towards the police. Indeed, after observing that the officers were not at
    risk “because [the respondent] had a cell phone on his person”, she continued
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Mr. White was
    totally compliant and responsive to the officer’s detention. He made no threatening
    gestures with his phone or otherwise. He did not attempt to run, he showed
    no inclination to violence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again,
    with respect, those observations, while accurate, miss the point. Constable
    King testified that he seized the phone because he wanted (if possible) to
    prevent the respondent from summonsing back-up assistance. He also explained
    that to accomplish that, he had to take possession of the phone; requiring
    the respondent to simply put it away was insufficient because the phone may
    well have been “a two-way” phone designed to transmit even though apparently “shut-off”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another
    reason given by the trial judge for rejecting Constable King’s “officer safety” concerns
    was that “on his own evidence, [he] perceived no real danger or discomfort
    in the process until later when the accused put his hand on the floor of
    the vehicle”.  That observation by the trial judge must, of necessity, relate
    back to Constable King’s evidence on the s. 10(a) pre-trial <i>voir dire</i>.
    It could not relate to his evidence on the s. 8  mid-trial <i>voir dire</i> because
    Constable King testified, in no uncertain terms, that officer safety was
    one of the paramount reasons for seizing the respondent’s cell phone when
    he did.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    being so, I am respectfully of the view that it was inappropriate for the
    trial judge to use Constable King’s pre-trial <i>voir dire</i> testimony
    as a basis for impugning his credibility on the s. 8 <i>voir dire</i>. It
    is true that on the pre-trial <i>voir dire</i>, Constable King made no mention
    of “safety concerns” as a reason for seizing the respondent’s cell phone
    when he did. But that is hardly surprising. The cell phone seizure was not
    in issue on the pre-trial <i>voir dire</i>; hence there was no reason for
    Constable King to explain why he seized the phone when he did.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge made no mention of the second reason given by Constable King
    for seizing the respondent’s cell phone, namely, protecting against the possible
    loss of evidence should friends of the respondent appear on the scene.  That
    too, was a legitimate basis for seizing the cell phone and the trial judge
    erred in failing to consider it, much less give effect to it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    sum, when the correct legal principles are applied to the facts as found
    by the trial judge on the s. 10(a) pre-trial <i>voir dire</i>, I have no
    doubt that Constable King was fully justified in seizing the respondent’s
    phone when he did, for the reasons he gave. There was no s. 8 breach here.
    Constable King was engaged in a high risk investigation. He and his partner
    were in plain clothes, in an area of town notorious for drug and gun related
    crimes. They were investigating a suspected drug dealer who knew that he
    was being followed by the police and who was “caught in the act” conveying
    information to someone as Constable King approached him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    Constable King seized the respondent’s cell phone, he found himself in a
    dangerous and potentially volatile situation. In the circumstances, he had
    little time to reflect.  He had to make a split second decision; a moment’s
    hesitation could have put his life and that of his partner in peril. Courts
    should keep this in mind when assessing the conduct of officers in the field.
    When it comes to officer safety and preserving the integrity of their investigation,
    police officers should be given a good deal of leeway and second guessing
    should be avoided. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, I am satisfied that the trial judge erred in ruling that Constable
    King breached the respondent’s s. 8 <i>Charter</i> rights when he seized
    the respondent’s cell phone. It follows that the evidence obtained thereafter,
    including the marijuana, the loaded firearm, and the ammunition, should have
    been admitted into evidence.</p>

    trial judge found that the police were lawfully entitled to detain the respondent
    for investigative purposes. She further found that at the outset of their
    investigation, the police breached the respondent’s <i>Charter</i> rights
    in two ways – first, under s. 10(a)<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    which he was being investigated and second, under s. 8, for unlawfully seizing
    his cell phone.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her s. 24(2) analysis, the trial judge found that there was both a temporal
    and causal link between the two breaches and the evidence seized thereafter
    from the respondent and his car. I mention that for one reason. In my respectful
    view, there was no causal link here.  In the context of her s. 10(a) ruling,
    the trial judge found that the respondent would not have done anything different
    had he been told of the second valid reason for his detention; so too, in
    my view, he would not have done anything different had Constable King not
    seized his cell phone. Indeed, one of the ironies in this case is that the
    respondent did not even tell his counsel about the timing of the seizure
    of his cell phone. That information came from the testimony of Constable
    King, initially on the pre-trial <i>voir dire</i> and then, in cross-examination
    by defence counsel midway through the trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    the extent that a temporal link existed, I need not decide whether it was
    sufficiently strong to warrant a finding that the <i>Charter</i> breaches
    were an integral part of a single transaction. Suffice it to say that I have
    my doubts on the issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assuming,
    for present purposes, that the after-acquired evidence needed to convict
    the respondent was “obtained in a manner” that violated his <i>Charter</i> rights,
    I respectfully disagree with the remainder of the trial judge’s s. 24(2)
    analysis. In particular, I do not accept her finding that the seizure of
    the respondent’s cell phone constituted a serious breach; nor do I accept
    that the police acted in a high-handed or abusive manner.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Commencing
    with the seriousness of the breach, if Constable King breached the respondent’s
    s. 8 rights when he seized his cell phone (which, I have determined, he did
    not) the breach was at most a minor one made in good faith. His error (assuming
    there was one) consisted of seizing the phone instead of ensuring that it
    remained safely stored with the respondent. Given the dynamics of the situation,
    Constable King’s conduct can hardly be described as a serious breach. It
    is not as though he had no reason to be concerned about the respondent’s
    use of the phone. Moreover, in assessing the seriousness of the breach, it
    must be remembered that Constable King did not attempt to use the phone to
    obtain private information about the respondent. Had the ensuing investigation
    turned up nothing, the phone would have been returned to the respondent and
    at worst, the respondent would have been deprived of its use for a period
    of several minutes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    sum, assuming that there was a breach here, by no means was it serious. To
    label it as “robbery” and “lawless” behaviour, as defence counsel did, is
    inexcusable.</p>

line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Just
    as the breach was not serious, so too in my view, there was no basis for
    describing the police conduct as “high-handed” or
    “abusive”. The officers found themselves in a dangerous and potentially volatile
    situation. And yet, throughout, they acted with restraint and treated the
    respondent with courtesy and respect. Far from being high-handed and abusive,
    their manner at all times was both professional and conscientious. </p>
