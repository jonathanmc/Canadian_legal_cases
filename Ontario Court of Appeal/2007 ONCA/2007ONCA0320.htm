    the trial judge misapprehended the evidence in two important respects relating
    to evidence of collusion and the testimony of a witness about the removal
    of two bottles from the premises where the offences were alleged to have
    taken place.  Finally, he contends that the trial judge erred by relying
    on the two complainants prior conservative sexual nature in assessing
    whether they would have consented to the sexual activity in question.  </span></p>

    Thursday, July 12, 2001, the female complainant, her roommate and the appellant
    went for dinner at a restaurant.  They shared a bottle of wine, consuming
    about two glasses each.  After dinner, they drove in the appellants car
    to find an open liquor store.  They purchased vodka, gin and two four-packs
    of Rev coolers.  Rev coolers are alcoholic and also contain Guarana, a
    highly caffeinated plant extract.  They returned to the loft that the female
    complainant shared with roommates.  The male complainant, who was the female
    complainants boyfriend, met the three of them at the loft.</p>

    female complainants evidence, which the trial judge accepted, was that,
    in addition to the two glasses of wine at dinner, she drank one vodka and
    7-Up and most of one Rev, which was brought to her by the appellant.  The
    male complainants evidence, also accepted by the trial judge, was that he
    consumed about five or six shots of vodka during the course of the night.  He
    also consumed a Rev brought to him by the appellant and finished the Rev
    that had been given to the female complainant.  The male complainant testified
    that the appellant brought him and the female complainant the Revs with the
    caps already removed.  He also testified that the appellant told him there
    was special stuff in the drinks.  After the Revs were consumed by the complainants,
    the male complainant saw the appellant take the bottles away.  Later, when
    the police conducted their investigation, only six Rev bottles were found,
    although eight had been purchased.</p>

    and a complete loss of motor skills.  He went to get a hotdog with the roommate,
    vomited and then blacked out.  He did not recall coming back into the loft,
    but did remember sitting in the front room of the loft. He blacked out again.</p>

    but a tank top.  The appellant was between her legs and sucking on her right
    breast.  She was not able to gather the strength to push the appellant off
    her, but she told him to get off.  The male complainant was lying on the
    bed beside them, not moving.  She then blacked out again.  When she awoke
    again, she was on her back.  The appellant was on top of her, but she could
    not tell if they were having intercourse.  She could not move, but told the
    appellant to get off her and to stop.  The female complainant blacked out
    once more.  She was awakened by a wet feeling on her feet.  She jumped up
    and yelled that someone had ejaculated on her.  The appellant ran out of

    down the male complainants pants and rubbed his penis.  The male complainant
    was not able to move or speak and he was not thinking clearly.  He blacked
    out again.  He awoke again on the couch to find his pants off and the appellant
    groping his penis.  He still could not move and was unable to speak.  He
    blacked out again.  He awoke and saw the appellant running to the back of
    the loft.  The female complainant was crying and some of her clothes were
    off.  He passed out again and when he next awoke, he was lying in the female
    complainants bed.  He was not able to move.  The female complainant was
    lying beside him and crying.  The appellant was on top of her.  She was trying
    to push the appellant off and told him to stop.  At the same time, the appellant
    was masturbating the male complainant.  He passed out again.  The next time
    he woke up, the appellant was still on top of the female complainant and
    she was crying much louder.  The male complainant could not move and blacked
    out once more.  He next awoke to the female complainant yelling that someone

    question had taken place.  No date rape drugs
    were detected in the female complainants urine.  Only the components of
    ecstasy were revealed.  The male complainants urine also revealed the presence
    of ecstasy, as well as THC, which is the active substance in cannabis.  The
    complainants testified that they each took half of an ecstasy pill on Saturday
    night.</p>

    to s. 686(1)(a)(i) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,<i> </i>R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46,
    a conviction appeal may be allowed if the verdict is unreasonable or cannot
    be supported by the evidence.  Relying on <i>Corbett v. The Queen</i> (1973),
    14 C.C.C. (2d) 385 (S.C.C.), the Supreme Court of Canada articulated the
    test to be applied by an appellate court in <i>R. v. Yebes</i> (1987), 36
    C.C.C. (3d) 417 at 430:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>The function of the Court of Appeal,
    under s. 613(1)(a)(i) [now s. 686(1)(a)(i)] of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    goes beyond merely finding that there is evidence to support a conviction. <i>The
    court must determine on the whole of the evidence whether the verdict is
    one that a properly instructed jury, acting judicially, could reasonably
    have rendered.</i> While the Court of Appeal must not merely substitute
    its view for that of the jury, in order to apply the test the court must
    re-examine and to some extent reweigh and consider the effect of the evidence.

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    test was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Biniaris </i>(2000),
    143 C.C.C. (3d) 1.  Justice Arbour, writing for a unanimous court, explained
    at para. 37 that the test would be the same regardless of whether the verdict
    was delivered by a jury or a judge alone, but in the latter case, the reasons
    of the judge would be considered:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>The <i>Yebes</i> test is expressed
    in terms of a verdict reached by a jury. It is, however, equally applicable
    to the judgment of a judge sitting at trial without a jury. The review
    for unreasonableness on appeal is different, however, and somewhat easier
    when the judgment under attack is that of a single judge, at least when
    reasons for judgment of some substance are provided. In those cases, the
    reviewing appellate court may be able to identify a flaw in the evaluation
    of the evidence, or in the analysis, that will serve to explain the unreasonable
    conclusion reached, and justify the reversal.</span></p>

    testified that he consumed five or six shots of vodka and one Rev.  Both
    testified that they did not consume any marijuana on the night in question,
    although THC was detected in the male complainants urine sample.  Dr.&nbsp;Robert
    Langille, an expert in toxicology, testified that THC can remain in a persons
    system for anywhere between 24 hours to several weeks, depending on the frequency
    with which that person consumes marijuana.  The trial judge found it impossible

    however, Dr.&nbsp;Langille explained that this was not the only possible
    explanation.  He elaborated on this opinion as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Without &#8213; given that their statements
    included some doubt as to the amount of alcohol consumed, in particular,
    according to [the female complainant], and that individuals dont necessarily
    count their drinks while theyre &#8213; in a social situation, particularly
    where they dont have to drive, that they may have consumed enough alcohol
    to produce the &#8213; and certainly alcohol by itself can produce all of
    the effects that they had indicated, with the exception specifically of the
    hallucination, if that event is in fact a hallucination.  Moreover, some
    of the typically sedating drugs like GHB work very rapidly, as I explained
    earlier, and it appeared to me in their statements that their inebriation
    developed over some period of time. <i> And so by saying can, it did not
    mean necessarily that that was the only explanation, but that there</i> <i>&#8213;
    that their inebriation could be due to alcohol alone.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>

'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, during his examination&#8209;in&#8209;chief, the Crown had the
    following exchange with Dr. Langille:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. Sir, based on [the female complainants] past
    history of consuming alcohol, based on the consumption of two glasses of
    wine, one Rev and also based on the assumption that she consumed  sorry.
    Let me back up. Two glasses of wine, one vodka and 7- and one Rev, based
    on the assumption that she did not herself consume any drugs on the evening
    in question, could the amount of alcohol that she consumed account for the
    degree of inebriation that she stated she suffered, which includes significant
    memory impairment, immobility, and unconsciousness.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Ah, it is my opinion that that amount of alcohol
    alone could not account for that degree of inebriation in an individual who
    states their familiarity with alcohol, um, puts them into a moderate drinker
    category and is able to consume anywhere from five to eight drinks on a weekend,
    and while  while feeling the effects of that, not have this significant
    a degree of inebriation and memory loss that was described.</p>

'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the male complainant, Dr. Langille stated the following: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE WITNESS: Thank you. Ah, for a male who weighs
    145 pounds and consumes six, ah, drinks of vodka, 40 percent alcohol volume
    per volume, three quarters of an ounce each, and one Rev, seven percent vodka
    volume per volume 330 milliliters, after four hours from 10:15 and  10:15
    p.m. and 2:15 a.m., that individual would have a blood alcohol concentration
    of between 50 and 90 milligrams of alcohol in 100 milliliters of blood using
    the rate of elimination of alcohol from the body that I described previously.
    And a moderate drinker, someone who is used to drinking on weekends, an amount
    thats possibly as much as twice that level would not show the degree of
    inebriation that [the male complainant] described for the Court on the night
    in question. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    the Crown asked:</p>
  <p>Q. And do I understand your evidence correctly today that that amount of
    alcohol [six shots of vodka of three quarter ounces each over a period of
    four hours] would not have been sufficient to cause the effects that [the
    male complainant] described?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. Yes, thats correct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Langille also testified that the female complainants symptoms were not consistent
    with the use of ecstasy on the night in question:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. Now, Ill get to this in more detail in a few
    more minutes, but as part of your involvement in this case you were asked
    to review [the female complainants] videotaped statement to the police in
    which she described a number of symptoms that she experienced on the early
    morning hours of July 13th of 2001, which included losing consciousness,
    having a patchy memory, not being able to remember parts of the evening,
    being stumbly and not being able to control her motor skills, an inability
    to physically push someone off of her who was on top of her, and feeling
    of haziness and hallucination and not really  not knowing much of what went
    on over the course of those hours. Are those symptoms associated with the
    use of a stimulant type drug such as MDMA and MDA [the components in ecstasy]?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. No, theyre not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Langille was not asked specifically about whether the male complainants
    symptoms could be explained by the use of ecstasy.  It can be inferred from
    his evidence, however, that the male complainants symptoms, which were similar
    to the female complainants, would not have been caused by ecstasy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Langille did say that the male complainants symptoms could be explained
    by a combination of alcohol and marijuana.  However, having concluded that
    the male complainant did not consume marijuana on the night in question,
    this possibility was ruled out by the trial judge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, the trial judge accepted the complainants
    evidence that their symptoms on the night in question were different from
    those they normally experienced from drinking alcohol alone.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>The complainants were drugged</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accepting
    that the complainants symptoms were not caused by alcohol alone, marijuana
    or ecstasy, the trial judge ultimately concluded that the complainants had
    been drugged without their consent.  Dr. Langilles evidence was not inconsistent
    with this finding. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Langille testified that most, but not all, drugs would be detectable after
    three days.  This was the length of time between the alleged incidents and
    when the complainants gave their urine samples.  Dr. Langille testified that
    GHB would not be present at this time, as it is only detectable in urine
    within 12 hours of being consumed.  Ultimately, the trial judge ruled out
    the possibility that GHB had been administered in the present case.  This
    was because Dr.&nbsp;Langille had testified that there would be an earlier
    onset of the symptoms associated with GHB than what was experienced by the
    complainants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, a number of benzodiazepenes may not be detectable after three days,
    including triazepam, lorezepam and nritrazepam.  With respect to these drugs,
    Dr. Langille stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>And depending on the dose provided, doses of lorezepam
    combined with a BAC [blood alcohol concentration] of 100, um, the dose of
    lorezepam or nritrazepam, which would  may provide significant sedation,
    may be low enough that even though therapeutic concentration could be detectable
    in that time period, that um, a lower dose, which would still have a significant
    effect with the alcohol, may  in fact may not be detectable by that time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    further noted:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. And likely as well a third one, alprazolam,
    A-L-P-R-A-Z-O-L-A-M, may also not be detectable because its therapeutic dose
    can be very small.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to known drugs that may not be detectable, Dr. Langille testified
    about a variety of new drugs about which little is known:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. Might there be other date rape drugs that we
    havent discussed that could be responsible for the effects described that
    are not detectable either by the test done at the Centre of Forensic Sciences
    on the bottles or the test conducted on [the female complainants] urine?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A. There are a variety of new drugs on the market
    which have sedative properties which we can detect but we dont know at what
    concentrations we can detect them, and so may be able to miss them, particularly
    in a urine sample thats been taken several days later.  There are a variety
    of other sedatives and other drugs that are prescribed around the world that
    we dont have methods for.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
    the trial judges finding that the complainants consumed a date rape drug on
    the night in question is not inconsistent with Dr. Langilles evidence.  After
    rejecting that GHB was administered, there was still the possibility that
    a type of benzodiazepine or some new drug could have been given to the
    complainants.  The appellant contends that Dr. Langille did not testify in
    great detail as to the effects of these drugs so that the trial judge could
    determine whether they were consistent with the complainants actual symptoms.  Nonetheless,
    based on Dr.&nbsp;Langilles evidence and that of the complainants, in my
    view it was open to the trial judge to infer that a drug was administered
    to the complainants without knowing exactly what drug and in what dose.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>The appellant placed a stupefying
    substance in the Revs given to the complainants</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge concluded that the appellant administered the stupefying
    substance.  It would not be enough to show that the complainants had been
    drugged; the evidence must also link the appellant to the act in question.  The
    trial judge was satisfied that it did.  A number of facts led the trial judge
    to this conclusion.  First, he accepted that the appellant gave the Revs
    to the complainants with the caps already removed.  Second, the trial judge
    believed that the appellant said that there was special stuff in the drinks
    and that he encouraged the female complainant to finish her drink herself.  Third,
    the trial judge accepted that the two Rev bottles had been hidden by the
    appellant after the complainants had consumed the contents.  The police investigation
    recovered only six out of the eight purchased bottles.  Therefore, the trial
    judge was not concerned with the fact that the toxicological tests of those
    six bottles were negative; the two key bottles were not able to be tested.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>Conclusion</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, a review of the trial judges findings does not disclose an error

    by stating that the roommate did not give any evidence about the two Rev
    bottles that the male complainant said had been whisked away by the appellant

    appellant contends that these and similar passages in the trial judges
    reasons fall afoul of the principle that the prior sexual history of a
    complainant does not affect the probability that the complainant consented
    to subsequent sexual activity: see <i>R. v. Seaboyer</i> (1991), 66 C.C.C.
    (3d) 321 (S.C.C.).</span></p>

    judge concluded that the appellant had administered a stupefying substance
    that caused loss of consciousness, it follows that the complainants could
    not have consented to the sexual activity.  While the trial judge did not
    explicitly state that he was convicting on this basis, it can be inferred
    from his reasons that he found the drugging of the complainants to be a
    factor supporting their non-consent to the sexual activity.  He stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The drug was placed into the two Revs. There can
    be no other explanation.  Whatever that drug may be and the dose of it, we
    will never know. The two Rev bottles in question were never found. I accept
    the evidence of the complainants when they testified that they were drugged
    that night. Their symptoms are completely consistent with that. <i>I do not
    accept the theory that they were somehow inebriated with alcohol to the extent
    that their inhibitions were reduced.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
    it can be understood from this passage that the trial judge did not accept
    that alcohol caused the complainants to lose their inhibitions and engage
    in consensual sexual activity with the appellant.  Because it is accepted
    that sexual activity did take place during the night in question, the inference
    can then be drawn that the complainants drugged state rendered them incapable
    of consenting.   </p>

    them that consent means the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage

    complainant is incapable of consenting to the activity.  To clarify things,
    he told the jury that you cannot consent if you are unconscious.  The law
    requires consent that is conscious and continuous, i.e., during all acts.  The
    consciousness must be continuous.  No objection is taken to this part of
    the instruction.</p>

    the present appeal, because the trial judge accepted that the stupefying
    substance caused the complainants to go in and out of consciousness while
    the sexual activity was taking place, it follows that the complainants would
    have been incapable of providing the necessary consent.</p>
