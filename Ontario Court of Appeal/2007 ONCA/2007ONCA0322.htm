    February 2001, Drouillard received an employment offer from Mastec
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    (“Mastec”), a cable industry contractor, to work on one of Mastec’s projects
    which involved internet upgrades for Cogeco Cable Inc. (“Cogeco”)
    in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Windsor area.  Upon being advised by Cogeco that it did not want Drouillard
    working on any of its equipment, Mastec withdrew its employment offer from
    Drouillard who was at Mastec’s office in anticipation of signing his employment
    contract.  In May 2001, Drouillard was hired by Mastec but was terminated
    for the same reason almost immediately after starting work.</p>

    damages together with pre-judgment interest and costs.  Cogeco has appealed
    liability, the quantum of damages, and the quantum of costs.  Drouillard

      trial judge awarded judgment in favour of Drouillard.  He found that Cogeco
      had engineered Drouillard’s termination by Mastec and that its conduct
      was malicious and punitive.  The trial judge rejected Cogeco’s evidence
      wherein Cogeco suggested that it did not want Drouillard working on its
      equipment because of his attitude and because his presence on Cogeco’s
      site would be bad for morale.  The trial judge found that Drouillard was
      a competent and able technician and that there was no reasonable basis
      for Cogeco’s refusal to allow Mastec to assign Drouillard to Cogeco projects. </span></p>

      that Cogeco intended to injure him, that Cogeco interfered with his employment
      by illegal or unlawful means, and that Drouillard suffered economic loss
      as a result of Cogeco’s actions.</span></p>

    concluded that had Cogeco not prevented him from working for Mastec, Drouillard
    would have earned $137,535 for the period from February 2001 to February
    2004.  The trial judge therefore awarded Drouillard this amount for lost
    income.  The trial judge also found that Drouillard had suffered humiliation,
    embarrassment, loss of reputation, and loss of his chosen career.  The trial
    judge awarded an additional $62,465 for “at large” damages.</span></p>

      against Cogeco proceeded and, although it is not clear from the pleadings,
      the cause of action appears to have been founded in the torts of unlawful
      interference with economic relations and inducing breach of contract.  In

      in his reasons, the trial judge dealt with the tort of unlawful interference
      with economic relations.  He framed the issue as being whether “there has
      been an unlawful interference with [Drouillard’s] contractual and economic
      relations with Mastec”.  As he undertook the legal analysis, the trial
      judge then stated that the heart of Drouillard’s claim is the allegation
      that
    “Cogeco has wrongfully<a href="#_ftn1"

    in the manner in which it caused his employment contract with Mastec to be
    rescinded by it on two separate occasions”.  The trial judge next dealt specifically
    with the tort of unlawful interference with economic relations identifying
    the three elements that need to be proven as:</span></p>

      trial judge then reviewed the evidence and concluded that all three elements
      had been made out.  On this appeal, Cogeco has taken issue with the second
      element, maintaining that its actions were neither illegal nor unlawful.  I

      was made out, the trial judge addressed the appropriate damages award and
      appears to have done so on the basis that Cogeco was liable for the tort
      of inducing breach of contract.  Specifically, the trial judge found that
      Drouillard was entitled to damages as a result of Cogeco’s “wrongful act
      of procuring [the employment contract’s] breach” and assessed the damages
      flowing from the tort of inducing breach of contract. </span></p>

      there remains some uncertainty about how broadly the expression “unlawful
      interference” should be interpreted, it is accepted that the commission
      of an intentional tort constitutes unlawful means.  This requirement could
      be satisfied if, for example, Drouillard had established that Cogeco’s
      actions and interference were defamatory.  It has also been held by this
      court in <i>Reach M.D. Inc. v. Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association
      of Canada </i>(2003), 65 O.R. (3d) 30 at paras. 50-52 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), that unlawful means also includes acts which the tortfeasor “is not at
    liberty to commit”.  In that decision, the court adopted the view of Lord
    Denning as expressed in <i>Torquay Hotel Co. Ltd. v. Cousins</i>, [1969]
    1 All E.R. 522 at 530 (C.A.), where he stated:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>I must say a word about unlawful means, because that brings in another
      principle.  I have always understood that if one person deliberately interferes
      with the trade or business of another, and does so by unlawful means, that
      is, by an act which he is not at liberty to commit, then he is acting unlawfully,
      even though he does not procure or induce any actual breach of contract.  If
      the means are unlawful, that is enough. </span></p>

      the present case, the trial judge found that Cogeco had an internal policy
      to the effect that if it wanted to prevent a contractor from using a certain
      individual on a Cogeco project it could so instruct the contractor if there
      was reasonable cause to do so.  Based on this finding the trial judge then
      considered whether, applying the test set out in <i>Reach</i>,<i> supra</i>,
      Cogeco had been at liberty to act as it did.  He concluded as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>In this case, while Cogeco may have had some right to dictate who
      works on its equipment, it is the way that it went about this that is all
      wrong.  The secret and unsupported evidence that D’Agostini convinced McGuire
      to act on and which clearly did not pass the smell test of “reasonable
      cause” (a policy of the company) amounts, in my view to an illegal act
      or one without legal justification and as such I find that the second element
      of the tort has been met.  I would also add in support of my conclusion
      on this point that in taking this action against the Plaintiff Cogeco has
      breached its own corporate policy of not doing so without there being reasonable
      cause and then failing to investigate this issue.</span></p>

      Cogeco or its employees were “not at liberty” to act contrary to the company’s

      situation in the present case is quite different from the facts of <i>Reach</i>.  In <i>Reach</i>,
      the tortfeasor, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association of Canada
      (the “PMAC”) was a voluntary trade association whose powers were set by
      its membership.  The PMAC had a written Code of Marketing Practices (the “Code”)
      which the association administered through one of its committees.  The
      committee made a ruling against Reach M.D. Inc., one of the association’s
      members, which it had no power to make according to the Code.  Laskin J.A.
      held that the PMAC had not been “at liberty to commit” the act because “the
      Committee acted beyond its jurisdiction” in making a ruling which it “was
      not authorized to make.  Its ruling was beyond its powers”: <i>Reach</i> at
      paras. 43, 52, and 53.</span></p>

      to a certain degree by its members and the Code was directed at protecting
      the interests of its members.  In <i>Reach</i>, the PMAC’s actions were
      problematic as the association’s ruling went beyond the limits of the powers
      which its members had given it and the ruling adversely affected the interests
      of a member, Reach M.D. Inc.  In the present case, however, Cogeco’s unwritten
      internal policy was not put in place to protect the interests of Drouillard
      or Mastec.  It does not appear that Drouillard or Mastec were aware of
      or relied on this policy.  Further, there was no indication that Cogeco
      and the employees involved in the decision regarding Drouillard were “not
      at liberty” to suspend or simply disregard this unwritten policy.</span></p>

      turn now to defence of justification.  There are certain situations where
      a defendant can avoid liability by claiming that his actions which induced
      the breach of a contract were justified.  Phillip H. Osborne, <i>Law of
      Torts</i>, 2d ed. (
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto: Irwin Law, 2003) at 300-302, reviews the defence of justification
    but asserts there is little useful modern Canadian authority for this principle.  Osborne
    notes, at 300-301, that what authority there is suggests “it has a narrow
    scope”, “that the absence of malice or bad faith is insufficient to establish
    the defence”, and “that a scrupulous consideration must be given to all the
    surrounding circumstances.”  Osborne paints with a broad brush certain circumstances – such
    as protecting the public interest – where inducing a party to breach a contract
    may be justified and where a defendant may be insulated from attracting liability
    in tort.  See also Lewis N. Klar, <i>Tort Law</i>, 3d ed. (

      and violated Drouillard’s employment agreement with Mastec, had acted contrary
      to its corporate policy, and that its conduct was malicious and punitive.  According
      to the trial judge, there was also evidence of malice or unfair dealing
      on the part of Cogeco in acting against Drouillard’s attempt to obtain
      employment with Mastec.  Nowhere did the trial judge suggest Cogeco’s actions

    of “at large” damages for inducing breach of contract is “not limited to
    specific or special damage and may, for example in case of wrongful dismissal,
    include compensation for the inconvenience and unhappiness caused by a change

    have earned from February 2001 to February 2004 had he been able to work
    for Mastec and then add to this figure damages for losses he considered to
    be “at large” in the sense that they were in excess of the demonstrated pecuniary
    loss sustained by Drouillard.  The trial judge assessed the pecuniary loss
    as being $137,535 and the “at large” amount as $62,465 for a total of $200,000.  He
    then determined that, by February 2004, Drouillard had retrained and there

    reduce the lost income by 30% to reflect the likelihood that Drouillard would
    have undergone periods of unemployment and did not further reduce the figure
    by $92,455.23 in mitigation to account for Drouillard’s earnings during 2001,
    2002, and 2003.  Cogeco also submits that the “at large” award of $62,465

    for his part maintains that, subject to his cross-appeal on the failure to
    award damages for future lost income and punitive damages, the trial judge’s
    assessment of damages should stand.  He concedes that his earnings for 2001,
    2002, and 2003 ought to have been taken into account as mitigating his loss.  Drouillard
    maintains, however, that the mitigation should have been applied to a much
    higher lost income figure as the trial judge had erred in his calculation
    of the lost income figure.  According to Drouillard, the amount by which
    the trial judge underestimated the lost income figure was substantially in
    excess of the $92,455.23 in mitigation.  Although the correct net amount
    should in fact be greater than the amount calculated by the trial judge,
    Drouillard is content that the award made by the trial judge stand.</p>

    ):
    “The doctrine of interference with contractual relations has been extended
    to include … where the performance became more difficult though not impossible.”  There
    is also English authority suggesting that the mere fact that the party induced
    had an option to terminate the contract under its terms is of no avail to
    a defendant who has procured a breach.  See <i>Emerald Construction</i>,<i> supra</i>,
    but contrast <i>Cutsforth v. Mansfield Inns</i>, [1986] 1 W.L.R. 558 at 563
