  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    litigation concerns a dispute between two developer groups regarding an alleged
    joint venture for three development projects, including a retail outlet mall
    in a suburb of the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Windsor.  There are two principal issues on appeal: first, whether the parties
    entered into a binding joint venture agreement (“JVA”), the wrongful termination
    of which by the respondents, Amico Contracting &amp; Engineering (1992) Inc.,
    Windsor Factory Outlet Mall Ltd., and Dominic Amicone,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> would entitle the appellant, Consulate Ventures
    Inc. (“Consulate”), to damages for breach of contract; and, in the alternative,
    whether Consulate is entitled to restitutionary relief based on <i>quantum
    meruit</i> for services rendered in respect of the Windsor outlet mall.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge held that a binding JVA had not been finalized by the parties,
    thereby precluding the recovery by Consulate of damages for breach of contract.  She
    also denied Consulate’s <i>quantum meruit</i> claim.  Accordingly, she dismissed
    Consulate’s action and awarded the respondents their costs of the trial,
    together with prejudgment interest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the following reasons, I agree with the trial judge that an enforceable JVA
    was not concluded by the parties.  However, it is also my view that the trial
    judge erred by dismissing Consulate’s <i>quantum meruit</i> claim.  Accordingly,
    I would allow the appeal and, given the record in this case, direct a new
    trial on the latter issue.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>II.        Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    many of the facts relevant to the issues on appeal are not in dispute before
    this court, the parties are divided on the question of the adequacy of the
    trial judge’s assessment of the evidence.  Accordingly, it is necessary to
    consider the factual context of the parties’ relationship and certain of
    the trial judge’s factual findings in some detail.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(1)       Preliminary Events</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1995, Heritage Centre Holdings Inc. (“Heritage”) acquired twenty-two acres
    of land in LaSalle, Ontario (the “Windsor Property”), which it intended to ‘flip’ to
    a third party for the development of retail facilities.  However, despite
    its efforts during the next two years, Heritage was unable to sell or lease
    the Windsor Property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consulate,
    an experienced shopping plaza developer, was introduced to the Windsor Property
    by a Heritage representative in the summer of 1997 when Consulate’s president,
    John Sorokolit (“Sorokolit”), visited the site.  At that time, Consulate
    owned forty acres of land in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Niagara Falls,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario (the “Niagara Property”), which it was proposing to develop as a
    retail outlet facility.  It was also involved in preliminary plans for a
    resort in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Niagara Falls, referred to by the parties as the “Grand Niagara Project”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sorokolit
    was experienced in the development of outlet malls, a relatively new concept
    in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    in 1997.  When Sorokolit saw the Windsor Property, he thought that it had
    potential for the establishment of an outlet mall.  This led to a series
    of proposals by Consulate to Heritage in the summer and early fall of 1997
    regarding the possible joint development of the Windsor Property as a retail
    outlet mall.  Heritage rejected these proposals.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    mid-September 1997, however, Consulate and Heritage agreed in writing to
    explore the possibility of jointly developing a manufacturers’
    outlet mall on the Windsor Property (the “1997 Agreement”).  Under this agreement,
    the parties agreed that if Consulate obtained sufficient prospective tenant
    interest in the proposed outlet mall by the end of 1997, the parties would “proceed
    to formulate a [JVA] on terms which are reasonable and are mutually acceptable
    to both parties”.  The 1997 Agreement further stated that if Heritage was
    satisfied with the leasing potential of the Windsor Property as a manufacturers’ outlet
    mall, “both parties shall enter into a [JVA] prior to March 1, 1998”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the 1997 Agreement was superceded by later events, the parties emphasize
    two of its terms.  The first stated that if Heritage cancelled the 1997 Agreement
    prior to December 31, 1997 due to insufficient tenant interest in the proposed
    outlet mall, but nonetheless commenced construction of a manufacturers’ outlet
    mall within two years, Heritage would pay Consulate a consulting fee (a “break
    fee”) of two million dollars.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second term concerned the consensual dissolution of the arrangement between
    the parties.  It provided that if the parties mutually agreed to dissolve
    their relationship by December 31, 1997, “neither party shall be liable to
    the other for any loss, costs or expenses”.  When Heritage executed the 1997
    Agreement, its president – the respondent Dominic Amicone (“Amicone”) –
    added a handwritten note immediately after this dissolution provision, stating
    that, in addition, Heritage would “no longer be responsible for the costs” – the
    break fee – outlined in the 1997 Agreement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, Amicone testified that he intended this note to be a stand-alone term
    that eliminated any obligation to pay the break fee.  Consulate, in turn,
    maintained that the note applied only if the consensual dissolution provision
    of the 1997 Agreement was triggered.  It also asserted, in any event, that
    the break fee was relevant to its <i>quantum meruit</i> claim because it
    afforded important evidence of the parties’ intention that Consulate would
    be paid for its efforts relating to the proposed
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Windsor outlet mall.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    1997 Agreement was short-lived.  In October 1997, when Heritage received
    information from a third party that caused it to question the suitability
    of the Windsor Property for an outlet mall, it decided to sell the Windsor
    Property to a Consulate-related company for $2.5 million (approximately $110,000
    per acre) (the “Sale Agreement”).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Sale Agreement was conditional.  It afforded Consulate a three month due
    diligence period within which to satisfy itself that an acceptable tenancy
    level could be achieved for the proposed outlet mall.  This deadline was
    extended by the parties, ultimately affording Consulate until February 22,
    1998 to satisfy or waive the due diligence condition.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    notable events occurred before the expiry of the due diligence condition.  First,
    almost immediately after the execution of the Sale Agreement, Consulate approached
    Nike
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , a major retailer, about the possibility of Nike becoming an anchor tenant
    in the proposed
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Windsor outlet mall.  According to Sorokolit, Nike expressed interest in
    this proposal.  Sorokolit claimed that he informed Amicone of Nike’s interest,
    but also explained that because Consulate was involved in a dispute with
    an outlet mall developer in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Niagara Falls, where Nike hoped to build a store, Sorokolit should not be
    involved directly in further discussions with Nike about the proposed
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Windsor outlet mall.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, Amicone denied any knowledge that Sorokolit had contacted Nike prior
    to the expiry of the Sale Agreement.  However, Consulate established that
    after speaking with Sorokolit in mid-January 1998, Amicone spoke with a Nike
    leasing agent.  It is uncontested that, eventually, a letter of intent was
    received from Nike concerning the lease of premises in the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Windsor outlet mall and that a leasing agreement was negotiated with that
    company.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    Amicone told Sorokolit that he had an agreement in principle to buy out the
    interests of some of Heritage’s minority shareholders for $60,000 per acre – an
    amount almost fifty per cent less than the agreed per acre price under the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sale Agree-ment.  On Sorokolit’s version of events, this disclosure effectively
    braked any further efforts by Consulate to satisfy the due diligence requirement
    of the Sale Agreement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    events unfolded, the Sales Agreement expired without Consulate having waived
    or satisfied the due diligence condition.  As a result, the transaction contemplated
    under the Sale Agreement never took place.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      Alleged JVA</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    mid-March 1998, when he visited the Niagara Property, Amicone became interested
    in and satisfied of the viability of the site’s potential for an outlet mall
    development.  He informed Sorokolit of his interest in the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Niagara market.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Also
    in the spring of 1998, Consulate created the name
    “Windsor Crossing Premium Outlets” and registered it with the applicable
    authorities as a business name in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario.  It appears that Heritage began using this name in respect of the
    proposed
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Windsor outlet mall in the spring of 1998.  Consulate also registered the
    term “premium outlets” as a trademark in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the next several months, the parties exchanged information about the Windsor
    and Niagara Properties, as well as the Grand Niagara Project.  They also
    met to discuss the terms of a joint venture concerning all three development
    projects.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unbeknownst
    to Heritage, however, Acktion Corporation (“Acktion”), one of Consulate’s
    lenders, held a mortgage on the Niagara Property pursuant to a loan and participation
    agreement.  Under the terms of this agreement, absent a waiver by Acktion
    of its participation rights, Consulate could not transfer an interest in
    the Niagara Property to a third party without Acktion’s consent as long as
    Acktion’s loan, in the approximate amount of two million dollars, remained
    outstanding.  Moreover, Consulate was precluded from entering into any joint
    venture without Acktion’s prior consent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding
    the terms of the Acktion agreement, Consulate wrote to Heritage on June 16,
    1998 outlining the terms of a proposed joint venture (the “June Letter”).  This
    document is central to the issues on appeal because Consulate relies on it
    as constituting the alleged JVA between the parties.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    June Letter contemplated the joint development by Consulate and Heritage
    of the Windsor Property as a manufacturers’ outlet mall to be known as “Windsor
    Crossing Premium Outlets”, and the Niagara Property as a retail commercial
    development.  It also provided for the acquisition by the proposed joint
    venturers of an interest in the Grand Niagara Project.  In the form provided
    to Heritage, the material terms of the June Letter included:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)        Consulate and Heritage (or its nominee,
    the respondent Amico Contracting &amp;
    Engineering (1992) Inc.  (“Ami-co”)) would form a joint venture, to be known
    as “Amicon Developments” (“Amicon”);</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)      Heritage would transfer a fifty per cent
    interest in the Windsor Property, together with a promissory note in the
    amount of $1.25 million, to Consulate, “upon for-mation of the Joint Venture”;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii)     Consulate would transfer a fifty per
    cent interest in the Niagara Property to Heritage
    “upon formation of the Joint Venture”;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iv)      the opening of the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Windsor outlet mall would be tar-geted for April 1999;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(v)       Heritage would be responsible for “architectural
    and engineering drawings, governmental approvals and construction management”,
    while Consulate would be responsible for “leasing, marketing and property
    management”. The services rendered by both companies would be provided “at
    reasonable market rates which are acceptable to the Joint Venture”;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(vi)     the joint venture – Amicon – would obtain
    the financing to complete the construction of Phase I of the outlet mall
    on the Windsor Property;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(vii)    Amicon would “continue to develop” the
    Niagara Property as a retail commercial property;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(viii)   Amicon would “secure an interest” in the
    Grand Niagara Project, described in the June Letter as a 250 acre golf and
    400 hotel room resort “being developed … in conjunction with Royco Hotels
    and Resorts of Calgary, Alberta”; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ix)      Amicon would obtain all construction
    contracts associated with the Grand Niagara Project; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(x)      each of the joint venturers and Amicon
    would bear prorated shares of the development costs – the “soft costs” – of
    the Grand Niagara Project, in an amount not to exceed $450,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly,
    para. 8 of the June Letter read:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>8. Amicon shall be formed upon “Nike” signing a
    lease or agreement to lease for the [Windsor outlet mall] of no less than
    15,000 square feet and both Heritage/Amico and Consulate entering into satisfactory
    Joint Venture, Manage-ment and Trust Agreements governing the activities
    of their Joint Venture.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    June Letter, which Sorokolit signed on behalf of Consulate, concluded with

    June Letter made no mention of the Acktion mortgage or loan and participa-tion
    agreement.  Nor did Consulate or Sorokolit otherwise disclose these matters
    to the Heritage Group when proposing the joint venture and the land exchanges
    envisaged by the June Letter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Heritage
    did not sign the June Letter immediately.  However, Amicone kept Sorokolit
    informed of progress on issues concerning the development of the Windsor
    Property throughout the spring and summer of 1998.  He provided Sorokolit
    with copies of relevant documentation, including construction drawings for
    Phase I of the outlet mall, brochures of the proposed development, and a
    draft lease agreement that had been forwarded to Nike for review.  The trial
    judge accepted Amicone’s evidence that these actions were undertaken because
    he was
    “interested in pursuing a joint venture rela-tionship” with Consulate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sorokolit
    and Amicone met in mid-July to discuss the joint venture.  In several follow-up
    letters to Heritage, Consulate pressed for completion of the joint venture
    arrangements.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    September 1998, Consulate informed Acktion of the proposed
    “land swap” with Heritage concerning the Windsor and Niagara Properties and
    sought Acktion’s consent to the transfer to Heritage of an interest in the
    Niagara Property, or the waiver by Acktion of its participation rights.  Alternatively,
    Consulate proposed that Acktion might wish “to participate in both projects”.  Acktion’s
    security interest in the Niagara Property and its loan and participation
    agreement with Consulate had still not been disclosed to the Heritage Group.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Acktion
    rejected Consulate’s various proposals, ultimately taking the position that
    it would relinquish its participation rights only upon payment of its outstanding
    loan to Consulate.  At trial, Sorokolit maintained that Consulate had access
    to funds sufficient to retire its obligations to Acktion, such that Consulate
    could complete the land transfers contemplated by the June Letter.  The trial
    judge, however, expressly rejected this evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart
    from the undisclosed issues concerning Acktion, the trial judge also found
    that Consulate knew when it signed the June Letter that a rezoning application
    in respect of the Niagara Property had been refused, as had Consulate’s application
    for leave to appeal from that refusal.  As a result, Consulate had written
    to Acktion on June 16, 1998 – the same day that it forwarded the June Letter
    to Heritage – informing Acktion that the development of the Niagara Property
    “must be placed ‘on hold’ indefinitely until such time as [Consulate could]
    devise an alternate development scheme”.  It does not appear that Consulate
    told the Heritage Group of these impediments to the development of the Niagara
    Property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    critical meeting between Sorokolit and Amicone took place on November 14,
    1998, when they reviewed the progress of the development of the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Windsor outlet mall, including various construction financing proposals for
    that project.  Importantly, Heritage also signed the June Letter.  However,
    para. 8 of that letter, set out in para. 24 of these reasons, was first crossed
    out and its deletion was initialled by the parties, along with other handwritten
    changes.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

    father, William Sorokolit Sr., was present at the November 14 meeting.  It
    was his unchallenged evidence at trial that, prior to the deletion of para.
    8, the parties discussed the absence of any need for the further documentation
    mentioned in that paragraph.  He also stated that he offered to pay fifty
    per cent of any cash requirement for the development of the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Windsor outlet mall and to provide any personal guarantees required by the
    joint venture’s lenders as a condition of construction financing.  Finally,
    he said that after the June Letter was signed by Heritage, the parties shook
    hands and he remarked that his son and Amicone would be good joint venture
    partners.  His son’s testimony at trial was to the same effect.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    the time Heritage signed the June Letter, the parties had been engaged in
    discussions regarding a JVA for many months, focusing initially on the development
    of the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Windsor outlet mall and, subsequently, on the development of the Windsor
    and Niagara Properties, and the Grand Niagara Project.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other
    significant events had also occurred, or were in progress.  Sorokolit was
    actively pursuing major tenants for the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Windsor outlet mall, including Adidas, Escada and Nike, the latter of which
    was expected to deliver a leasing commitment in the near future.  As well,
    Sorokolit had delivered to Amicone drawings for signage at the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Windsor outlet mall, and photographs and other documents concerning outlet
    malls in the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    to assist in formulating the design concept for the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Windsor mall.  He had also reviewed and advised Heritage on such matters
    as the site plans, elevation drawings, blueprints, construction specifications,
    and design and configuration renderings for the
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Windsor outlet mall.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consulate
    relies on these activities, and on the conduct of the parties after Heritage
    signed the June Letter, as evidence that the parties agreed to a binding
    JVA on November 14, 1998.  In particular, it says that, in accordance with
    its obligations under the June Letter and at the request of or with the concurrence
    and encouragement of the Heritage Group, it furnished services to the Heritage
    Group during the period from mid-November 1998 to June 22, 1999 to advance
    the development of the Windsor outlet mall in furtherance of what it understood
    was a subsisting JVA.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    services by Consulate included reviewing completed construction drawings
    and a revised site plan for the Windsor outlet mall; hiring, at its own expense,
    an experienced leasing agent to assist in securing suitable retail tenants;
    continued efforts to obtain prospective retail tenants; obtaining a firm
    leasing commitment from Adidas; and the exploration and proposal of tax-efficient
    alternatives to the land exchanges outlined in the June Letter.  I will return
    to the relevance of some of these facts in my discussion of the legal issues.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    June 23, 1999 – one day before Phase I of the
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Windsor outlet mall was scheduled to open – Heritage’s solicitors wrote to
    Consulate, taking the position that the June Letter constituted merely an
    agreement to agree or a letter of intent, and denying any agreement between
    the parties to proceed with a joint venture.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    their letter, Heritage’s solicitors also stated,
    “Further, as a result of the delay and the fact that Consulate does not control
    the [Niagara Property] described in the [June Letter], our client is unwilling
    to proceed with any joint venture with you.”  These assertions were based,
    in part, on an inaccurate title search of the Niagara Property, which suggested
    that Consulate did not own part of that site.  At trial, however, Consulate
    established that it did own the entirety of the Niagara Property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Approximately
    three months later, Consulate sued the Heritage Group, seeking damages for
    breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty of confidence,
    and breach of the duty to bargain in good faith.  It also sought an accounting
    and disgorgement of profits concerning the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Windsor outlet mall, and damages or restitutionary relief based on <i>quantum

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Heritage Group defended the action on several grounds, including on the basis
    that a complete JVA had never been entered into by the parties.  In the alternative,
    they pleaded that if a JVA existed in June 1999, it had been properly rescinded
    by Heritage.</p>

      the legal situation that flows from a binding [JVA]”.  She also held that
      the parties did not expect to be paid “for their efforts to bring the joint
      venture relationship to fruition”.  Accordingly, she dismissed Consulate’s

      judge’s holding that the June Letter did not constitute a binding JVA.  First,
      it says that the trial judge misdirected herself as to the applicable test
      for determining the intention of the parties regarding the June Letter.  Second,
      it submits that the trial judge erred in several respects in her evaluation
      of the evidence.  Third, it argues that the trial judge erred by concluding
      that the June Letter omitted terms necessary for the creation of a binding
      JVA.  Finally, it maintains that the trial judge’s reasons are inadequate

      para. 2 of her reasons, the trial judge stated:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The parties agree that a [JVA]
      is a relational contract and not a transactional one.  Accordingly, the
      intentions of the parties becomes critical in answering the following question:  Did

      think that something more was to be done to complete the contract?</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Consulate
      argues that these passages reveal that the trial judge improperly focused
      on subjective, rather than objective, factors in determining the intention
      of the parties, thereby misdirecting herself as to the applicable legal
      test for determining the effect of the June Letter.  </span></p>

      disagree.  Although it is true that the trial judge referred early in her
      reasons to the parties’ subjective beliefs concerning the effect of the
      June Letter, in her subsequent analysis of the relevant law she said at
      para. 42: “The issue to be decided is whether the execution of a formal
      contract is a prerequisite for an enforceable contract or whether it is
      merely a step in carrying out an already enforceable contract.”  Then,
      at paras. 43 and 44 of her reasons, the trial judge expressly noted that
      the intention of the parties concerning the June Letter was to be viewed
      objectively, based on the parties’ words or conduct.  She applied this
      principle to the facts as she found them, concluding at para. 45, “<i>Viewed
      objectively</i>, the words and actions of both parties … suggest that they
      intended their agreement to be a step in the negotiations as opposed to
      a binding contract.”  [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

      argues that the trial judge erred in her evaluation of the evidence: (i)
      by ignoring evidence of the deletion of para. 8 from the June Letter, of
      the Sorokolits concerning the events surrounding Heritage’s signing of
      the June Letter, and of the parties’ conduct thereafter; and (ii) by taking
      into account irrelevant considerations.  I would reject these arguments.</span></p>

      argues that the deletion of para. 8 of the June Letter was a signal event
      that confirmed the parties’ intention to be bound by the joint venture
      provided for under that letter, without the necessity of further negotiations
      or additional documentation.  This is supported, Consulate submits, by
      William Sorokolit Sr.’s evidence of the events surrounding Heritage’s execution
      of the June Letter – including the discussions between the parties when
      the document was signed – and by the parties’ conduct thereafter.  The
      trial judge, Consulate says, ignored this critical evidence when she held
      at para. 45 of her reasons that: “Viewed objectively, the words and actions
      of both parties in this case suggest that they intended their agreement
      to be a step in the negotiations as opposed to a binding contract.”  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my opinion, however, the trial judge’s reasons indicate that she was cognizant
    of the relevant evidence of the parties’ intention and that she applied the
    proper legal principles to that evidence.  I say this for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the trial judge’s reasons indicate that she lent her mind, as she was obliged
    to do, to the language of the June Letter.  For example, at para 45 of her
    reasons she wrote, “Neither party acted on the agreement as though it was
    final and binding, <i>and the wording in the [June Letter] contemplates further
    negotiation</i>.” [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      see no error in this finding.  Even after the deletion of para. 8, numerous
      paragraphs in the June Letter suggest that it relates to a prospective
      undertaking.  In its introductory paragraph, the June Letter states that
      Consulate “would be interested to proceed as a Joint Venture”.<a
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a>  In paras. 2 and 3 of the June Letter, reciprocal
      land exchanges were called for, “upon formation of the Joint Venture”.  Finally,
      in the concluding paragraph of the document, Sorokolit indicated that,
      upon Heritage signing the June Letter, he would “proceed to prepare the
      draft Joint Venture documents for your review”.  The wording of this concluding
      paragraph indicates that further documentation </span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>was required even
      if amendments were made to the June Letter prior to its execution by Heritage.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    as I have said, the trial judge expressly accepted Amicone’s evidence that,
    by striking para. 8, he intended only to delete the condition pertaining
    to obtaining an executed lease (or agreement to lease) from Nike, and not
    the companion condition that required the completion of a formal JVA and
    associated documentation as a prerequisite to the creation of the joint venture.  By
    accepting this evidence, the trial judge implicitly addressed the events
    of November 14, 1998 surrounding the signing of the June Letter, including
    the removal of para. 8.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    the trial judge clearly understood the importance of the June Letter to Consulate’s
    case.  As she observed at para. 18 of her reasons, the June Letter was “pivotal
    to the theory of Consulate’s case”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is no doubt that the letter to which the trial judge referred in her reasons
    was the version of the June Letter with para. 8 deleted.  Indeed, this version
    was attached as Schedule “A” to the trial judge’s reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      this context, and given the significance attached by Consulate to the removal
      of para. 8 from the June Letter, I cannot agree that the trial judge ignored
      that key amend-ment to the version of the June Letter that was ultimately
      signed by both parties.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It
      is true, as Consulate emphasized during oral argument before this court,
      that the trial judge did not explicitly mention the evidence of the deletion
      of para. 8, or the Sorokolits’ testimony about the discussions between
      the parties when Heritage signed the June Letter, in her reasons.  Given
      the reliance placed on this evidence by Consulate to demonstrate the alleged
      existence of an enforceable JVA, it would have been preferable had the
      trial judge addressed this evidence directly in her reasons.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Nevertheless,
      in my opinion, properly read, the trial judge’s reasons reveal that she
      concluded on the record as a whole that the evidence of the events of November
      14, 1998 fell short of establishing the creation of a binding JVA between
      the parties.  This finding is supportable on the evidence and not open
      to appellate review.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      addition to those parts of the trial judge’s reasons to which I have already
      referred, this conclusion is bolstered by other passages of her reasons.  For
      example, at para. 35, the trial judge revisited the issue of the completeness
      of the June Letter.  She indicated:</span></p>

      disagree.  The mutual obligations contained in the June Letter were predicated
      on the parties being positioned both to undertake and to perform their
      respective commit-ments under that letter.  Evidence establishing that,
      from the outset, Consulate was not in a position to undertake these commitments
      was highly relevant to the question of whether the June Letter had the

      this respect, I disagree with Consulate’s submission that the June Letter
      may be analogized to an agreement of purchase and sale for the transfer
      of mortgaged land.  Under the latter type of agreement, no question arises
      at the time of contract formation concerning the vendor’s ability to sell
      the land – all that is required is the discharge of the mortgage on closing
      in order to deliver clear title to the land sold.  By contrast, in this
      case, when the June Letter was signed, Consulate was not in a position
      to develop the Niagara Property at all.  Nor was it in a position to do
      so at any point prior to the commencement of this litigation.  Moreover,
      its agreement with Acktion prohibited any form of joint venture concerning
      the Niagara Property without Acktion’s consent, which was never given.  Nor
      could the Grand Niagara Project proceed in the fashion described in the
      June Letter – Royco Hotels and Resorts of Calgary was not committed to
      the project.</span></p>

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Windsor outlet mall when it was not positioned to proceed with the development
    of the Niagara Property or the Grand Niagara Project.  To hold otherwise

      acknowledged before this court that the June Letter contains a “bundle
      of obligations”.  I agree.  The bargain contemplated by the parties concerned
      three development projects, each of which formed an integral part of the
      proposed joint venture.  The June Letter contains no language suggesting
      that these projects were severable, such that Consulate could enforce a
      joint venture concerning the Windsor Property while also being relieved

      major incentive for Heritage to sign the June Letter was the prospect that
      the joint venturers would obtain the construction contracts associated
      with the Grand Niagara Project, as specified in the June Letter.  As Sorokolit
      pointed out in his testimony, this provision of the June Letter was inserted
      at the insistence of Amicone.  This, together with the reciprocal land
      exchanges called for under the June Letter, compels the conclusion that
      the foundation for the proposed joint venture was the mutual advantages
      to the parties to be realized under all three development projects.</span></p>

      as material (the value of the Windsor Property; the value of the Niagara
      Property; and the method by which Heritage would be compensated for the
      development of the Windsor Property).  She described these as the “most

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      my view, there are several key omissions in the June Letter.  First, it
      makes no provision for the nature of the development on the Niagara Property
      or, in contrast to its provisions concerning the Windsor Property, for
      the respective responsibilities of the parties in relation to that development.  Nor
      does it mention the encumbrances on that site or how they were to be discharged.  Also,
      in the main, the June Letter is silent on the respective responsibilities
      of the parties concerning the Grand Niagara Project, including on the matter
      of the funding for the acquisition of interest contemplated for that development.  </span></p>

      the view that I take of the commercial undertaking envisaged by the June
      Letter, these omissions, by themselves, render the June Letter unenforceable
      as a JVA.  These are not merely technical or administrative matters.  Rather,
      in my opinion, they are necessary components of the overall development
      undertaking provided for under the June Letter.  Without specific agreement
      on these issues, the obligations assumed by the parties in respect of these
      two projects were unclear and uncertain.  Simply stated, the terms of the
      parties’
    bargain concerning two-thirds of the undertaking contemplated by the June

      that the “missing” terms identified by the trial judge were either not
      required by law or were addressed in the June Letter.  It suffices to indicate
      that terms essential to the formation of a binding JVA in respect of the

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There
      are two difficulties with these comments.  First, the authorities make
      clear that services provided in reliance on
    “some underlying measure of agreement” and at the request, or with the acquiescence,
    of the beneficiary of the services are compensable, although a valid enforceable
    contract between the parties may not exist.  Services provided in these circumstances
    are not viewed as having been given gratuitously, based on speculation.  G.H.L.
    Fridman, in his leading text <i>Restitution</i>, 2d ed. (Toronto: Carswell,
    1992), put it this way at 301-02:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i><span lang=EN-US>The decided cases reveal a
        sharp contrast between situations in which what the plaintiff did was
        done at the defendant’s request or with the knowledge and acquiescence
        of the defendant and those in which the plaintiff acted in his own supposed
        interests</span></i><span
lang=EN-US>.  In the latter instances, the plaintiff may have believed that ultimately
        he would profit from some contract that he hoped or expected would emerge
        from what was done.  In the event, however, no such contract materialised.  The
        plaintiff’s behaviour could be characterised as being tantamount to speculation.  <i>Such
        cases differ from those in which there is some underlying measure of
        agreement, although not sufficient to constitute a valid, enforceable
        contract, in virtue of which the plaintiff performs the work or provides
        the services that are at issue.  There must be established some express,
        or sometimes implied, request to do the work or some encouragement on
        the part of the defendant of the plaintiff that may be said to have misled
        the plaintiff into the belief that a contract would result.</i>  At the
        same time, what the plaintiff does must be a reasonable and foreseeable
        response to the behaviour of the defendant.  Furthermore, the consequence
        of what the plaintiff has done would seem to be that the defendant obtains
        a benefit of some kind.  In other words, the defendant must be enriched
        by the plaintiff’s acts.  [Footnotes omitted and emphasis added.]</span></p>

      where the claim for restitutionary relief is based on <i>quantum meruit</i>,
      as in this case, an explicit mutual agreement to compensate for services
      rendered is not a prerequisite to recovery. It suffices if the services
      in question were furnished at the request, or with the encouragement or
      acquiescence, of the opposing party in circumstances that render it unjust
      for the opposing party to retain the benefit conferred by the provision
      of the services.  See <i>Fridman, supra,</i> at pp. 290-92; <i>Nicholson

lang=EN-US>The value of these varied services, in my opinion, cannot be discounted – essentially
      to zero – on the premise that they reflect a free exchange of information “between
      colleagues”.  Consulate had no relationship with the Heritage Group prior
      to the summer of 1997.  Thereafter, for a period of about two years, it
      became closely involved in discussions and activities with the Heritage
      Group regarding the development of the Windsor Property.  In so doing,
      it is arguable that Consulate provided at least some proprietary information
      or other assets to the Heritage Group (for example, the registered business
      name for the outlet mall and Sorokolit’s photographs and other documents
      regarding the proposed design of the mall).  Consulate also incurred expenses
      (for example, the retainer of a leasing consultant) that furthered the
      progress of the

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Windsor outlet mall; its design suggestions admittedly inspired and appear

      concluded that the inclusion of the break fee provision in the 1997 Agreement
      was intended to
    “test” what Sorokolit viewed as Heritage and Amicone’s lack of business experience
    and sophistication, and that this provision was “wisely removed”.  Nonetheless, <span lang=EN-US>although
    the 1997 Agreement was eventually overtaken by other events, the break fee
    is still one indicator, among others, of the course of dealings between the

      not diminish the fact that the Heritage Group continued to accept services
      from Consulate regarding the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    Windsor outlet mall, without compensation, after November 14, 1998.  Some
    of these services were expressly requested by Amicone or Heritage.  Others
    were provided with the encouragement or acquiescence of the Heritage Group.  At
    no point after Heritage signed the June Letter until June 22, 1999 did the
    Heritage Group assert that Heritage did not understand, or that it rejected,

      to the Heritage Group or the time spent on the services provided.  Rather,
      it led expert evidence about usual fee arrangements in the industry for
      consultants who contract to provide services.  The trial judge made no
      assessment of this expert evidence, nor any findings about the value of
      the services actually furnished by Consulate.  In these circumstances,
      a new trial is required to determine the nature, extent and value of the
      services provided by Consulate concerning the Windsor Property.  I note
      that although the Heritage Group argues that no recovery is available against
      Amicone in his personal capacity or Amico, as distinct from Heritage, it
      will be for the trial judge at the new trial to determine which of the
