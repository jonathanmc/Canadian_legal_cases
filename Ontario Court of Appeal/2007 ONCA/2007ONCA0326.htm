style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant, Morris Waxman (“Morris”), appeals from the order of Spies&nbsp;J.
    dated June 28, 2006 in which his brother, the respondent Chester Waxman (“Chester”),
    was successful in obtaining $370,000 from frozen accounts to fund his legal
    fees for a component of the long running and expensive family legal saga
    that has occupied the brothers, their families, their companies and the courts
    of Ontario for many years.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appeal raises three issues: whether the motion judge had jurisdiction to
    make the order sought in light of the fact that Farley&nbsp;J. had made a
    previous order relating to Chester’s legal costs in the proceedings; whether
    the motion judge should have exercised her discretion to make the order given
    that an appeal of Farley&nbsp;J.’s order was pending in this court; and whether
    the relief sought (an order allowing Chester to access further funds to pay
    for his legal fees) ought to have been granted.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>B.        </span>FACTS &amp; PROCEDURAL
    HISTORY</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is a long and complicated procedural history in this case that must be described
    briefly in order to understand the nature of the present appeal. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Morris
    and Chester Waxman have been involved in lengthy litigation against each
    other, principally concerning the ownership of their family scrap metal business,
    I. Waxman &amp; Sons Limited (“IWS”).  In 2002, Sanderson J. released her
    decision in the main litigation and restored Morris as a 50% shareholder
    of IWS.  Morris was awarded damages against Chester, Chester’s sons and IWS,
    the precise amount of which was to be determined on a reference to a Master.  Solid
    Waste Reclamation Inc. (“SWR”), a company controlled by Morris’ sons, was
    also awarded damages.  The trial judgment was upheld on appeal, save for
    minor variations, and leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was
    refused. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Throughout
    the litigation, IWS had paid virtually all of Chester’s and his sons’ legal
    fees.  In January 2003, Chester and his sons were ordered to repay these
    fees to IWS. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    the trial judgment was rendered, Morris commenced an oppression application
    against Chester and others with respect to the management of IWS.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    January 2004, Farley J. (who was case managing the oppression application
    and was appointed the r. 37.15 judge) ordered that IWS be restrained from
    paying Chester’s legal fees.  IWS was also enjoined from repaying any loans
    to Chesterton Investments Limited (“Chesterton”), a company solely owned
    by Chester.  The amount that is said to be owing to Chesterton is being held
    in a notional account at IWS, referred to as the Chesterton Loan Account. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    an effort to preserve the assets that would be available to satisfy the main
    judgment, Morris sought further relief from Farley J. in November 2004.  By
    order dated November 3, 2004, Farley J. froze all of the assets of Chester
    and his sons, with the exception that they could have access to $100,000
    per month for their employment with IWS.  This order did not provide for
    the payment of legal fees and in a subsequent order dated March 2, 2005,
    Farley J. stated that Chester and his family could use the frozen funds to
    pay for reasonable legal fees.  A protocol was established for the payment
    of these fees.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    September 1, 2005, Farley J. released his judgment in the oppression application.  In
    that judgment, his previous freezing orders were continued.  The protocol
    for the payment of legal fees was also continued. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    November 2005, by <i>ex parte</i> application, SWR obtained notices of garnishment
    and served them on a number of banks with whom Chester held accounts.  The
    practical result was that Chester and his family could no longer access the
    frozen funds to pay their reasonable legal fees.  Chester brought a motion
    to have the notices of garnishment vacated.  On December 23, 2005, Farley
    J. ordered that the notices of garnishment were to be vacated only to the
    extent necessary to allow Chester and his family to repay certain legal fees
    to IWS and to access up to a maximum of $250,000 for the payment of legal
    fees for the Reference for damages.  Additionally, Farley J. ordered that
    if the frozen funds were insufficient to fund these amounts, the Chesterton
    Loan Account could be accessed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Chester
    appealed the December 23, 2005 order.  While the hearing of the appeal was
    pending, Chester brought a motion before Spies J. (she had replaced Farley
    J. as the r. 37.15 judge in this matter) to allow him and his sons to access
    further funds in order to pay for the ongoing Reference.  The $250,000 allowed
    by Farley J. had been exhausted and Chester sought an additional $370,000
    to be able to complete the Reference.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the time the motion before Spies J. was heard, the damages Reference was
    well under way before Master Linton.  In oral argument before Spies J., the
    motion was framed as a motion to vary the December 23, 2005 order of Farley
    J., then under appeal by Chester.  In an order dated June 28, 2006, Spies
    J. granted the requested relief and ordered that Chester be permitted to
    access up to a further $370,000 from the frozen funds or the Chesterton Loan
    Account to pay for the reasonable legal fees of the Reference.  This is the
    order that is currently under appeal before this court. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    provide further context to this appeal, it is worth noting some of the subsequent
    procedural history.  The appeal of Farley J.’s December 23, 2005 order was
    dismissed by this court on October 25, 2006.  Further, after 25 days of hearing,
    Master Linton released his report on the Reference on January 4, 2007 assessing
    the damages owed to Morris, at approximately $52,000,000.</p>
  <h4><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>THE
    MOTION JUDGE’S DECISION</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge held that she had jurisdiction to vary Farley&nbsp;J.’s order.  She
    concluded that in light of the fact that Farley&nbsp;J. had been the case
    management judge for some time and that the parties had been before him as
    many as twenty times, “there is no basis upon which I could determine that
    the intention of Farley&nbsp;J. was to choose a figure for legal costs that
    was not subject to variation.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge then considered whether Chester’s appeal of Farley&nbsp;J.’s
    order should incline her to exercise her discretion and not hear Chester’s
    motion until the appeal was heard and determined.  She carefully reviewed
    Chester’s appeal and concluded that the gist of the appeal was Chester’s
    claim that Farley&nbsp;J. erred by not determining that the notices of garnishment
    were invalid; in contrast, Chester’s appeal did not attack the $250,000 quantum
    that Farley&nbsp;J. had excepted from garnishment to pay for Chester’s legal
    costs connected to the Reference.  She stated that “in principle, there is
    no reason why [Chester] cannot both pursue an appeal of the order of Farley&nbsp;J.
    and move to vary the order, provided the proposed variation does not affect
    the substance of the appeal.”  She concluded that the proposed variation
    did not affect the substance of the appeal and that it was, therefore, preferable
    that she deal with the motion on its merits.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the merits, the motion judge granted the relief sought by Chester, which
    permitted him to access a further $370,000 to fund his legal fees associated
    with the Reference.  In her reasons, the motion judge analyzed whether the
    relief should be granted on two bases.  First, she considered it from the
    viewpoint that Chester was seeking a motion to vary Farley J.’s December
    23, 2005 order.  Second, she considered the matter <i>de novo</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the first part of her analysis, the motion judge held that there were new
    facts that had arisen that justified a variation of the order under rule
    59.06(1) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg.&nbsp;194.  First,
    the Reference had taken longer than anticipated and second, additional frozen
    funds had become available for the payment of legal fees.  The motion judge
    then considered what financial resources were available to Chester and his
    family and observed that questions on this subject were refused by Chester’s
    son Robert during the cross-examination on his affidavit.  The motion judge
    then drew an adverse inference that other family assets (other than the monthly
    $100,000.00 sum and the frozen funds) were being used to finance the litigation.  However,
    the motion judge refused to give effect to that adverse inference.  She stated
    that the availability of other family resources had not been considered as
    relevant by Farley J. and, in an effort to keep her decision consistent with
    his, she declined to attach any relevance to that fact either.  As the motion
    judge held that there were no new arguments that had not been raised before
    Farley J., she determined that the only issue was whether the amount sought
    by Chester was reasonable.  She held that it was and concluded that the relief
    could be granted on the basis that she was varying Farley J.’s prior order.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the second part of the motion judge’s analysis, she considered the matter <i>de
    novo</i>.  Here, the motion judge held that the question of whether provision
    should be made for the payment of legal fees should be determined on the
    basis of proprietary injunction principles.  Relying on <i>Canadian Imperial
    Bank of Commerce v. Credit Valley Institute of Business and Technology</i>,
    [2003] O.J. No. 40 (S.C.J.), the motion judge held that the test for determining
    whether a defendant ought to be allowed to access funds subject to a proprietary
    injunction involves finding that (1) the defendant has no other assets available
    to him and (2) the injustice of permitting the use of the funds by him is
    outweighed by the possible injustice to the defendant if he were denied access
    to those funds.  On the first part of the test, the motion judge held that
    Chester did not have to establish that no other family members could assist
    him financially.  The question was whether Chester personally had funds available
    to him.  Next, the motion judge held that the possible injustice to Chester
    if he was denied access to additional funds would be the inability to defend
    himself on the Reference.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Therefore,
    on the basis of the proprietary injunction test, the motion judge determined
    that Chester and his sons should be able to access the requested $370,000
    to continue with the Reference.</p>

    order establishing a protocol for the payment of Chester’s legal fees, and
    the December 2005 order releasing an additional $250,000 from frozen funds
    to pay for Chester’s legal costs relating to the Reference.</p>

    this context &#8213; a long running case management process and several orders
    over almost three years dealing with legal costs &#8213; it makes no sense
    to conclude that Farley&nbsp;J.’s December 23, 2005 order was the final word
    on the question of funding the litigation.  In my view, there can be no doubt
    that in May&nbsp;2006 Farley&nbsp;J. could have heard a motion to vary his
    December order dealing with Chester’s legal costs for the Reference.  Farley&nbsp;J.’s
    retirement in April 2006 and his replacement as case management judge by
    the motion judge did not change the picture in the least.  The motion judge
    had jurisdiction to hear and determine the motion.  I agree with her analysis
    and conclusion on this issue.</p>

    disagree.  The principal issue on the appeal of Farley&nbsp;J.’s order was
    unrelated to the quantum of legal costs for Chester to fund his participation
    in the Reference.  Moreover, the Reference was rolling forward by May 2006.</p>

    order had been determined.  She could even have suggested that Chester take
    steps to expedite the appeal which, I observe, could have been easily accomplished.  However,
    in spite of this option, I cannot say that the path chosen by the motion
    judge &#8213; hearing and determining the motion on the merits while the
    Reference was actually proceeding &#8213;

  <h3>Positions of the parties </h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before
    this court, the parties argued over which test should be used to determine
    whether Chester and his sons should have been allowed to access further funds
    to pay their legal fees on the Reference, given that their assets had been
    frozen and certain bank accounts had been garnished.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for Morris argued that special considerations applied since Morris had already
    been successful in the main litigation and all that had to be determined
    was the precise amount that was owed to him.  In other words, this was not
    the same situation as one in which a defendant was subject to an interlocutory
    injunction pending the outcome of a trial.  As such, it was argued that any
    money that was accessed by Chester was actually Morris’ money and that Morris
    should not be forced to pay for Chester’s defence absent exceptional circumstances.  Specifically,
    counsel for Morris argued that the test laid out by the Supreme Court of
    Canada in <i>Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium v. Canada (Commissioner
    of Customs and Revenue)</i>, 2007 S.C.C. 2, should apply in a post-judgment
    context.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Little
      Sisters</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada considered the question of when
      an advanced costs award should be ordered in public interest cases.  Essentially,
      the majority adopted the approach from <i>British Columbia (Minister of
      Forests) v. Okanagan Indian Band</i>, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 371.  First, the
      majority stated that the person seeking costs must establish that the case
      is “special enough to merit this exceptional award”: para. 46.  In other
      words, the party must establish <i>prima facie</i> merit and public importance.  Second,
      the party must establish that it is impecunious and that, without the award
      for interim costs, the litigation would be unable to proceed.  Counsel
      for Morris argued that Chester had failed to satisfy this test.  It was
      argued, therefore, that the motion judge erred in allowing Chester to access
      additional money to pay for his legal fees. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    response, counsel for Chester submitted in oral argument that the Mareva
    injunction test should apply to the case at hand.  Counsel for Chester framed
    his argument as follows.  The remedy sought before the motion judge was permission
    to use funds in the Chesterton Loan Account to pay its legal fees on the
    Reference.  The Chesterton Loan Account was subject to a freezing order in
    the nature of a Mareva injunction (Morris had no proprietary interest in
    the Chesterton Loan Account and it had not been garnished).  Therefore, the
    proprietary injunction test employed by the motion judge was inapplicable
    and the test for determining whether a Mareva injunction should be varied
    to allow for the payment of reasonable legal fees should apply.  This test
    involves determining whether the defendant has no other assets from which
    to make the payments.  Counsel for Chester argued that this test had been
    satisfied and that the motion judge was correct to grant the relief.  In
    the alternative, counsel for Chester argued that the more onerous proprietary
    injunction test had also been met. </p>
  <h3>Which test should be applied?</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    issue before this court is which test should be used to determine whether
    frozen funds can be accessed to pay reasonable legal fees in a post-judgment
    context.  The appropriate test must then be applied to determine whether
    the motion judge erred in granting the relief in the order under appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for Morris urged this court to adopt the test from <i>Okanagan</i> and <i>Little
    Sisters</i>.  They argued that the proprietary injunction test employed by
    the motion judge was inappropriate in the present case because it required
    a balancing of the relative strengths of each party’s case.  It was submitted
    that this should not be done in the present case where it has already been
    determined that Chester is liable to Morris.  In my view this argument is
    not persuasive.  First, application of the <i>Okanagan</i>/<i>Little Sisters</i> test
    would not address the concern raised by Morris’
    counsel.  Specifically, this test also requires an analysis of the merits
    of the case: see <i>Little Sisters</i> at paras. 37 and 51 and <i>Okanagan</i> at
    para. 40.  Both the proprietary injunction test used by the motion judge
    and the <i>Okanagan</i>/<i>Little Sisters</i> test suggested by Morris’ counsel
    start from the viewpoint that the litigation has not yet been determined.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the <i>Okanagan</i>/<i>Little Sisters</i> test for interim costs awards is
    concerned specifically with public interest litigation.  The present litigation
    clearly does not fall under this category.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Therefore,
    I conclude that the <i>Okanagan</i>/<i>Little Sisters</i> framework is not
    applicable to the case at hand.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    next must be considered if the motion judge erred in applying the proprietary
    injunction test or if the Mareva injunction test would have been more appropriate.  These
    tests were fully explained by Molloy J. in <i>Credit Valley</i>, <i>supra</i>.  In
    that case, Molloy J. had to determine if various injunction orders should
    be varied to allow the defendant to pay certain expenses, including legal
    fees.  Because some of the injunctions were proprietary and others were Mareva
    injunctions, Molloy J. considered the principles that apply to both situations.  After
    canvassing the authorities, Molloy J. held that when granting relief from
    a Mareva injunction, the defendant must satisfy the court that he has no
    other assets from which to make the required payments: para. 19.  In the
    case of a proprietary injunction, however, the inquiry must go farther.  Molloy
    J. stated at para. 20: “It is one thing to permit payment of ordinary expenses
    out of money belonging to the defendant but which is frozen by a Mareva injunction.  It
    is another thing altogether to permit the defendant to use the plaintiff’s
    money for the purpose of attempting to defeat the plaintiff’s claim”.  She
    continued at para. 21:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The test to be applied in determining whether a
    defendant ought to be permitted to make payments out of funds subject to
    a proprietary injunction begins (as does the variation of a Mareva injunction)
    with a consideration of whether the defendant has established on proper evidence
    that he has no other assets available to him to pay the expenses.  If the
    defendant passes that hurdle, the court must engage in a balancing exercise “as
    to whether the injustice of permitting the use of the funds by the defendant
    is out-weighed by the possible injustice to the defendant if he is denied
    the opportunity of advancing what may of course turn out to be a successful
    defence”. [Citation omitted.]</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Justice
    Molloy summarized the applicable test at para. 26 as follows: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Has
    the defendant established on the evidence that he has no other assets available
    to pay his expenses other than those frozen by the injunction? </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If
    so, has the defendant shown on the evidence that there are assets caught
    by the injunction that are from a source other than the plaintiff, i.e. assets
    that are subject to a Mareva injunction, but not a proprietary claim? </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    defendant is entitled to the use of non-proprietary assets frozen by the
    Mareva injunction to pay his reasonable living expenses, debts and legal
    costs.  Those assets must be exhausted before the defendant is entitled to
    look to the assets subject to the proprietary claim. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(iv)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If
    the defendant has met the previous three tests and still requires funds for
    legitimate living expenses and to fund his defence, the court must balance
    the competing interests of the plaintiff in not permitting the defendant
    to use the plaintiff's money for his own purposes and of the defendant in
    ensuring that he has a proper opportunity to present his defence before assets
    in his name are removed from him without a trial.  In weighing the interests
    of the parties, it is relevant for the court to consider the strength of
    the plaintiff's case, as well as the extent to which the defendant has put
    forward an arguable case to rebut the plaintiff's claim.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is therefore apparent that regardless of whether the injunction is proprietary
    or a Mareva injunction, the first inquiry is always the same – has the defendant
    established that he has no other assets from which to pay the expenses?  In
    my view, the present appeal turns on this question.  Therefore, it is not
    necessary to determine whether the source of the funds in the present case
    was subject to a proprietary injunction (as found by the motion judge) or
    a Mareva injunction (as urged by counsel for Chester).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is clear from <i>Credit Valley</i> that the defendant has the onus of proving
    that he has no assets, other than those frozen, from which to pay his legal
    fees.  As noted above, the defendant must establish
    “on the evidence” that he has no other assets: <i>Credit Valley</i> at para.
    26.  In the present case, Chester attempted to meet this burden through the
    affidavit of his son, Robert Waxman.  In that affidavit, Robert stated that “Chester’s
    resources for satisfying legal fees are very limited” (para. 28) and that “since
    January [2006], my father and I have worked very hard to find an arrangement
    to fund the outstanding legal fees … and the fees likely to be incurred during
    the remainder of the Reference” (para. 29).  Robert further deposed that
    due to Chester’s recent diagnosis of late-stage cancer, “all of our family’s
    resources are being conserved to fund Chester’s medical treatment”
    (para.&nbsp;30).  Robert stated that there was an “absence of any third party
    sources of funds with which to pay Chester’s legal and professional expenses
    in connection with the Reference”
    (para. 32). </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Robert
    was cross-examined on this affidavit.  He refused virtually all questions
    regarding what resources were available to him and his father.  The motion
    judge noted as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Questions about these other financial resources
    [i.e. family resources that Chester’s wife Bailey or his grandchildren’s
    trust might or might not have] were refused on the cross-examination of Robert
    Waxman including questions about whether or not any of Chester, Robert or
    Warren’s spouses or children have assets which could be used to pay legal
    fees, whether they would lend them monies to pay the legal fees, whether
    anyone other than Chester has paid any of Davies’ accounts in respect of
    the Reference (beyond confirming that neither Robert nor Warren have paid
    anything in respect of the fees on the Reference) and who is paying for Brian
    Greenspan’s fees for Robert’s criminal charges and Alan Lenczner’s fees for
    Robert’s OSC hearing (beyond advising that the monies are not coming from
    frozen or non-frozen funds of Chester, Robert or Warren). </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge then drew an adverse inference
    “that these other family sources have assets and that they have provided
    financial assistance with respect to the Reference and other legal costs
    being incurred by Robert.”  The motion judge concluded, however, that it
    was not necessary for Chester to establish that there were no family resources
    available to pay his legal fees; he just had to establish that he personally
    did not have any assets from which to pay these fees.  There is support for
    this position in <i>Insurance Corp. of British Columbia v. Dragon Driving
    School Canada Ltd.</i>, [2004] B.C.J. No. 2503 (S.C.), where the court held
    at para. 10:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The plaintiff suggests that Mr. Chiu must show not
    only that he has no assets that are not frozen, but also that he has no other
    means of paying expenses, such as available lines of credit, or third parties
    who might voluntarily pay his expenses.  I have significant doubt that the
    test should be expanded in that fashion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the present case, the motion judge held that it would be an “impossible task” to
    try to determine if any other family members had available assets before
    an order could be made varying an injunction for the payment of legal fees.  With
    respect, it appears as though the motion judge proved that it was not an
    impossible task after all, as she drew the inference that in this particular
    case other family resources had been used to pay for Chester’s and Robert’s
    legal fees. </p>

    addition, even if it were inappropriate to look beyond the assets of Chester
    and his sons to determine whether any funds were available for the payment
    of legal fees, it can be said that in this case Chester and his sons did
    not meet the onus of establishing on proper evidence that they personally
    had no other assets available to them.  While Robert stated in his affidavit
    that he and his father had made efforts to arrange for funding of legal fees,
    in cross-examination he refused to answer any questions beyond stating that
    the $100,000 monthly sum was insufficient.  I observe that this statement,
    on its face, would be highly dubious in the eyes of almost any reasonable
    Canadian.  Further, Robert refused to answer any questions about what family
    resources were being conserved for the payment of Chester’s medical fees.  </p>

    the motion judge’s adverse inference and the many refusals made by Robert,
    it cannot be said that Chester established on the evidence that he had no
    assets available to him to pay for his legal fees, other than those frozen
    by the injunctions.  In my view, the motion judge erred to the extent that
    she held otherwise.  </p>
