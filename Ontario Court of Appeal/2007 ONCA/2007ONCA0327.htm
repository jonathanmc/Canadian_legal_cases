style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    only issue on this motion is whether a proposed witness, who has both delivered
    an affidavit in this proceeding and has agreed to answer questions on that
    affidavit, should be examined orally before a special examiner, as requested
    by the applicant, or by way of written interrogatories, as requested by the
    Crown and the proposed witness. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    proposed witness is Fred Graham who was an assistant Crown attorney involved
    in the prosecution of the applicant on fraud charges.  Mr. Graham has since
    been appointed to the bench.  Since this motion deals with the proposed witness
    as a Crown attorney, we refer to him as Mr. Graham in these reasons. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    applicant’s conviction appeal is based on the sole ground of abuse of process,
    an issue that he did not raise at trial.  In essence, the applicant alleges
    on appeal that Crown trial counsel abdicated their prosecutorial discretion
    to the complainants.  He argues that the Crown resiled from an initial offer
    to withdraw the outstanding charges against him in return for restitution
    of $14,000 and, at the instance of the complainants, insisted instead on
    restitution of $17,000.  In this manner, argues the applicant, the Crown
    conducted the prosecution as a means of enforcing a civil debt.  There are
    factual issues surrounding this allegation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    support of his appeal, the applicant seeks to introduce as fresh evidence
    his own affidavit as well as affidavits from the Crown counsel involved in
    his prosecution.  Two of the Crown counsel involved in the prosecution have
    filed affidavits and have already been examined before a special examiner.  The
    third, Mr. Graham, has filed an affidavit and has agreed to answer questions
    concerning the contents of that affidavit; however, he argues that his examination
    should be conducted by way of written interrogatories and responses, rather
    than by oral examination.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    683(1)(b)(ii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>For the purposes of an appeal under this Part, the
    court of appeal may, where it considers it in the interests of justice,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(b)       <u>order any witness</u> who could
    have been a compellable witness at the trial, whether or not he was called
    at the trial,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>i           to attend and be examined before
    the court of appeal, or</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>ii          <u>to be examined</u> in the manner
    provided by rules of court before a judge of the court of appeal, or <u>before
    any</u> officer of the court of appeal or justice of the peace or <u>other
    person appointed by the court of appeal for the purposes;</u>  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is unnecessary to consider in this case the scope of the pre-conditions for
    such an examination because both Mr. Graham’s counsel and the respondent
    conceded in oral argument that Mr. Graham could have been a compellable witness
    at the trial.  Since the Crown’s trial brief is missing and because the prosecution
    approach is at issue, they also acknowledged that Mr. Graham’s evidence is
    both
    “likely relevant” and “necessary” to the appeal.  Accordingly, it is in the “interests
    of justice” both that his affidavit be adduced as evidence and that he be
    examined in some fashion on the contents of that affidavit.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    examination of the other two Crown counsel, which was done orally, did not
    challenge their credibility, but only the reliability of their recollections.  The
    examinations, which were held before a special examiner, were not conducted
    in an adversarial or confrontational manner.  Facts were simply put to each
    of the deponents in an effort to refresh their memory.  Counsel agree that
    any oral examination of Mr. Graham would be conducted in a similar manner
    since, similarly, his credibility is not at issue, only the reliability of
    his recollection of the events at issue.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    683(1)(b)(ii) gives the court a discretion regarding the examination of the
    proposed witness.  Implicit in this is an acknowledgment that Mr. Graham’s
    subsequent appointment to the bench does not affect the issue.  This makes
    sense because Mr. Graham’s involvement in the trial prosecution was in his
    position as a Crown counsel, which predated and is unrelated to his current
    judicial role.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Graham’s counsel takes the position, however, that it would be unseemly for
    a sitting judge to attend before a special examiner, particularly when written
    interrogatories would be sufficient to obtain the required evidence.  On
    the other hand, counsel for the applicant points to the limitations inherent
    in written interrogatories and the absence of interchange and spontaneity
    available in that method of examination.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    agree that there are limitations to written interrogatories, which include
    potential delay when new questions arise from answers given.  In our view
    and in the circumstances of this case where the objective is to refresh the
    witness’s recollection, written interrogatories would unnecessarily curtail
    spontaneous responses to a series of questions posed for the purpose of jogging
    the witness’s memory.  In contrast, oral examination will give counsel the
    opportunity to follow Mr. Graham’s oral answers with questions arising from
    those answers, with the result that the examination can be completed both
    effectively and expeditiously.  Most importantly, the examination will be
    about events arising from Mr. Graham’s previous role as Crown counsel, not
    from his current judicial role, and it will seek to test the reliability
    of his memory, not his credibility.  There is no reason to conclude that
    his oral examination would impair the performance of his judicial role.  For
    these reasons, in our view, oral examination is in the interests of justice.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    we exercise our discretion to order that Mr. Graham’s examination regarding
    the reliability of his recollection of the evidence set out in his affidavit
    be conducted orally.  The examination will be conducted by Mr. Silverstein
    before a special examiner at a location to be agreed upon by the parties.  Given
    our disposition, we need not consider Mr. Silverstein’s argument that s.
    683(1)(b)(ii) does not permit the use of written interrogatories.</p>
