line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the evening of November 14, 1999, Matti Baranovski was tragically beaten
    to death by a group of hostile teenagers while he and some friends were innocently
    passing the time sitting on a park bench in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    North York.  He was a fifteen-year-old high school student at the time.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Matti
    and his friends were in the wrong place at the wrong time.  The hostile aggressors –
    part of a group known as “the Antibes group” (named after a local address) –
    had arrived at the park looking to confront a rival group of teenagers, known
    as “the Russians”, who had apparently offended the Antibes group by threatening
    one of their members two days before during a drug altercation.  When it
    turned out that “the Russians” were not in the park, most of the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Antibes group left, but a small number decided that since they were there,
    and did not want to go home empty-handed, they might as well rob the Baranovski
    group that was lounging around the bench in the park.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, Meir Mariani, and his co-accused, Lee Cochrane and Daniel Weiz,
    were amongst the members of the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Antibes group who approached Matti and his friends.  There is evidence that
    the appellant was seen talking to another boy, Mike Vesta – who is reported
    to have suggested the robbery – and that it was the appellant who said that
    he did not want to go home “empty-handed”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    substance of what happened that evening is not in dispute.  Someone in the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Antibes group demanded cigarettes and money (and drugs, if they had them)
    from Matti and his friends.  One friend handed over a wallet.  Matti resisted.  As
    a result he was pushed to the ground by someone and kicked by that someone
    and/or others.  One kick had the sad and unusual consequence of rotating
    and lifting Matti’s head simultaneously, causing his vertebral artery to
    rupture and rendering him unconscious within seconds.  There was no possibility
    of saving him.  But for that kick, his injuries were not life-threatening.  He
    died, nonetheless.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    primary issue at trial was the identity of the perpetrators.  Who was the
    teenager who demanded the cigarettes and money (known as the “cigarette demander”)?  Who
    was the pusher or tripper?  Who were the kickers?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Meir
    Mariani, Lee Cochrane, and Daniel Weiz were charged with second degree murder.  The
    evidence against them came primarily from two sources – the group of teenage
    friends who were in the park with Matti (and who were universally considered
    to be honest and credible, but who were unable to be clear about precisely
    what occurred that evening; none of them could identify the attackers), and
    a group of disreputable witnesses who were part of the hostile Antibes group
    of teenagers (and who had a clear motive to fabricate their stories in order
    to protect themselves and/or their friends from responsibility).  It was
    the theory of the Crown that the appellant was the cigarette demander and
    the pusher, and that all three co-accused were amongst the kickers, but that
    even if they were not amongst the kickers they were guilty as parties to
    manslaughter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    a six-month trial before McCombs J. and a jury, Mr. Mariani and Mr. Cochrane
    were acquitted of murder, but convicted of manslaughter.  Mr. Weiz was acquitted
    altogether.</p>

    Mariani appeals his conviction for manslaughter.  He challenges the adequacy
    of the trial judge’s charge to the jury on a number of grounds relating to
    the identity and intent of the perpetrators, and argues as well that the
    trial judge erred in permitting a Crown witness to be cross-examined on his
    prior inconsistent statements pursuant to s. 9 (2) of the <i>Canada Evidence
    Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5.  Specifically, the appellant submits that the

  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left;page-break-after:avoid'>The Instruction
    on Eyewitness Identification</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;page-break-after:avoid'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge gave the standard instruction on the acknowledged frailties of
    eyewitness identification in relation to the evidence of Matti’s friends.  The
    appellant does not argue he should not have done so.  While Ms. Glaister
    quibbled with some of the language used by the trial judge, the main thrust
    of her disagreement on this point was about what the trial judge did <i>not</i> say.  She
    submitted that he erred by warning the jury only about the dangers of identification
    evidence from honest, but mistaken, witnesses without also instructing the
    jury on how that same evidence might point away from the appellant in a positive
    way, thereby raising a reasonable doubt about his identity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidentiary basis for this argument evolves primarily around the various
    descriptions that Matti’s friends gave of the cigarette demander and the
    pusher.  Yavi Lipschitz – a particularly disreputable witness from amongst
    the
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Antibes group – testified that he saw the appellant push Matti to the ground.
    However, two of Matti’s friends described the cigarette demander and the
    pusher as wearing a black leather jacket and having gelled hair.  The appellant
    was not wearing a black leather jacket that night and did not have his hair
    gelled back.  Mike Nesta – the person said to have originally suggested that
    they should rob the Barnovski group since “the Russians” were not in the
    park – was wearing a black leather jacket and had gelled-back hair.  Thus,
    it was the defence theory that Mike Nesta, not the appellant, was the pusher.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge declined to give the additional instruction requested by defence
    counsel in that portion of his charge dealing specifically with the frailties
    of eyewitness testimony.  He rejected the submission that his charge in this
    regard amounted to an invitation to ignore the eyewitness evidence where
    it supported the defence.  He did not err in doing so, in the circumstances
    of this case, in my opinion, because in other portions of his charge he clearly
    highlighted the defence position (based upon the black leather jacket and
    gelled-hair evidence) that it was Mike Nesta, not the appellant, who was
    the pusher.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge was alert to the point made by this Court in <i>R. v. Wristen</i> (1999),
    141 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), that different considerations may apply to eyewitness identification evidence
    supporting the Crown’s case and eyewitness identification tending to exculpate
    the accused.  This is because, as Justices Laskin and Rosenberg noted in
    that case, at p. 23:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The need for
    special care concerning eyewitness identification evidence arises because
    of the danger of a wrongful conviction.  That danger does not exist where
    the eyewitness evidence tends to exculpate the accused.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    however, the Crown was relying on the eyewitness testimony of Matti’s friends
    as pointing towards the appellant’s guilt, even though the Crown conceded
    that none of them could identify him directly as a perpetrator.  It was therefore
    necessary for the trial judge to charge the jury with respect to the frailties
    of eyewitness identification evidence in relation to the Crown’s case.  As
    noted, Ms. Glaister does not strenuously argue to the contrary.  The trial
    judge was very careful, in this portion of his charge, to particularize it
    to the Crown’s case.  For instance, he told the jury: “You must be very cautious
    about relying on eyewitness testimony <i>to find any of the accused persons
    guilty</i>,”
    and “There is a special need for caution in dealing with these observations
    of characteristics <i>that may be consistent with</i> the accused persons” (my
    emphasis).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    response to counsel’s objection, the trial judge stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The purpose
    of my caution in this case was to underscore for the jury that although the
    witnesses could not specifically identify the accused persons, their description
    of the events and the size of the various assailants may also be suspect.  I
    did so to benefit the defence, not to bolster the Crown’s case.  Having reviewed
    my comments on this subject in light of Mr. Schreck’s submissions, I conclude
    that it is clear that the instructions would bring home to the jury that
    care should be taken lest they give the evidence greater weight than is appropriate
    in support of the Crown’s case.  I therefore decline to recharge the jury
    on this point.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    this Court has previously stated, it is not an error in law for a trial judge
    to instruct a jury to approach certain kinds of evidence favouring the defence
    with care – including inherently frail eyewitness testimony – and to instruct
    the jury on the reasons why caution is needed, provided the judge does not
    go further and give, in effect, what constitutes a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning
    that it is dangerous to act on that evidence alone: <i>R. v. Wristen, supra</i>,
    at 22-23.  See also <i>R. v. Jeffrey</i> (1989), 35 O.A.C. 321 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at 326-327.  At pp. 22-23 in <i>Wristen</i>, Justices Laskin and Rosenberg
    said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Rather, the
    instruction must be considered in the context of the charge.  If the appellate
    court is satisfied that when the charge is considered as a whole, an especially
    cautious instruction <i>did not unfairly undermine the defence position</i>,
    the appeal may be dismissed. [Emphasis added]. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, that is the case here.  It was not necessary for the trial judge
    to add the instruction requested by the defence to the eyewitness identification
    portion of his charge, because it was clear to the jury from the balance
    of the charge, read as a whole, that the evidence concerning the black leather
    jacket and the gelled hair pointed away from the appellant and may have created
    a reasonable doubt about his identity as the cigarette demander and pusher.  As
    the trial judge told the jury: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Mr. Fishbayn
    submits to you that on the evidence you should conclude that Mike Nesta is
    the person who witnesses identify as wearing a black leather jacket with
    his hair gelled back.  This is consistent with Mr. Baranovski’s friends’ descriptions
    of the person who pushed Mr. Baranovski and ultimately kicked him.  Mr. Fishbayn
    submits that Mike Nesta, not Mr. Mariani, is the person who pushed Mr. Baranovski
    to the ground.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    that clear instruction, together with the trial judge’s correct <i>W.(D.)</i> charge <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> – to which no objection was taken – I am satisfied
    that the charge did not undermine the defence position in this regard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Glaister goes further, however.  She submits that the trial judge was required
    to give an instruction in accordance with <i>Chartier v. Quebec (A.G.)</i> (1979),
    48 C.C.C. (2d) 34 (S.C.C.), to the effect that the descriptions of the assailants
    given by Matti’s friends exculpated the appellant.  I do not accept this
    submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is true that some of Matti Baranovski’s friends gave a description of the
    cigarette demander – in terms of what he was wearing and his style of hair – that
    did not describe the appellant.  However, none of them purported to identify
    the appellant as the cigarette demander.  Moreover, there was other evidence
    supporting the appellant’s identity as the pusher – the evidence of Yavi
    Lipschitz that he saw the appellant push Matti, and the testimony of Kevin
    Clift that the appellant admitted “tripping the kid”, for example.  This
    was not an identification case, then, that rested solely on the observations
    of eyewitnesses who purported to identify the accused but whose descriptions
    were clearly dissimilar to that of the accused in a situation where there
    was no other supporting evidence.  As Rosenberg J.A. noted in <i>R. v. Boucher </i>(2000),
    146 C.C.C. (3d) 52 at 58 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ),
    “<i>in the absence of some other inculpatory evidence</i>, a resemblance
    is no evidence.” [Emphasis added.]  And as Weiler and Gillese JJ.A. observed,
    in <i>R. v. Dimitrov</i> (2003), 181 C.C.C. (3d) 554 at 565 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ),
    “[t]he rule in <i>Chartier</i> applies to cases in which there is a clear
    dissimilarity in the witness’s identification coupled with a lack of supporting
    evidence.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On

    the indicia of a witness requiring a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning.  In support
    of this position, he emphasizes a number of features of Ms. Kotin’s testimony.  First,
    her evidence was important to the Crown as it incriminated the appellant
    in at least two respects (her testimony that the appellant had confessed
    to her about participating in the assault, and her testimony about his involvement
    in the plan to blame Dan Weiz).  Secondly, he highlights the following as
    classic indicia of a disreputable witness:</p>

    Kotin did not have a criminal record.  She was not present in the park when
    the event took place.  While she initially lied to the police when she first
    spoke to them and told them she knew nothing, she was unfortunately no different
    than many scared teenagers in similar circumstances, and she cooperated thereafter.  She
    had no motive to implicate others falsely in order to protect herself.  It
    is true that she is a very close friend of Yavi Lipshitz, but the trial judge

    who should attract a <i>Vetrovec</i> caution.  He heard the witnesses at
    trial and he declined to characterize her testimony at the preliminary inquiry
    as dishonest – notwithstanding certain inconsistencies with her testimony
    at trial. This was the trial judge’s call to make, and he was entitled, in
    the circumstances, to view the attacks on Ms. Kotin’s evidence as credibility
    challenges that did not rise to the level of an unsavoury <i>Vetrovec</i> witness.  In
    my opinion, there is no basis for interfering with his judgment that she
    did not fall into the category of witness calling for such a warning.</p>

    he was at the park the night Matti Baranovski was killed.  He said he was
    with his apartment superintendent, and he attempted to persuade the superintendent
    to support his false alibi.  Later, on December 14, 1999, after he discovered
    the apartment superintendent had refused to confirm the false alibi, Mr.
    Clift admitted he was in the park.  He attended with the police at the police
    station where he was interviewed – “aggressively”, the appellant says – and
    gave a lengthy 219-page statement under oath and on videotape.  During the
    first 130 pages of that statement, he claimed he had not seen what happened
    to Matti.  Then, after being confronted with information that other witnesses
    had seen him watching the beating, he told the police in the rest of the
    statement that the appellant had confessed he robbed Matti, that he had seen
    the appellant rob and trip Matti, and that he had seen the appellant and
    his co-accused kick Matti.  He performed a physical demonstration on the
    videotape of the appellant tripping Matti.</p>

    not recall who they were, and although he saw five or six people kicking
    Matti, he could not say who they were either.  In short, he refused to adopt
    the salient parts of his prior statement.  His explanation for this at the
    preliminary hearing was that he could not remember much of what he said to
    the police because he had been under the influence of drugs at the time,
    and because of the pressure from the police, he told them he had seen what
    happened whereas he was only relating what he had heard from others had happened.</p>

    to conduct a s. 9(2) cross-examination of Mr. Clift with respect to his prior
    inconsistent statements.  The trial judge refused the former request but

    submission, there was “absolutely no chance” that Mr. Clift would adopt any
    portions of the statement if cross-examined at trial.  Moreover, the prejudicial
    effect of permitting the Crown, in effect, to portray the entire scenario
    of what it said happened –
    including the appellant’s purported confession to Clift and his re-enactment
    of the tripping scenario – by asking the witness to adopt his statement on

    but contrary to an initial statement that he had given to the police (which
    was helpful to the Crown).  The case involved an alleged multi-party sexual
    assault.  The witness at first told the police he had not seen any consensual
    sexual activity.  Later he told the police, and testified, that he had seen
    a variety of consensual sexual activities involving the complainant, her

    show that the witness had lied in collaboration with his friends, the co-accused,
    thereby undermining their testimony – should they choose to testify – as
    well.  The trial judge permitted the cross-examination under s. 9(2).  On
    appeal, this Court held that the trial judge had little choice but to allow
    the cross-examination, given the Crown’s strategy in leading the evidence
    and the likelihood of leaving the jury with a false impression of the witness’s
    credibility without it, but that the trial judge erred in not providing a
    stronger charge on the use that the jury could make of such evidence.  The
    trial judge should have instructed the jury that, in the absence of evidence
    of collusion between the witness and the accused, there was no basis on which
    they could use the witness’ evidence or the fact that he was a liar to support
    an inference that the accused were liars too.</p>

    lies Ms. Glaister’s complaint.  In <i>Fraser</i> the accused was convicted
    of several offences arising out of a shooting incident at the home of her
    estranged husband.  The Crown called a witness – the accused’s companion,
    who the Crown theorized was the actual shooter – knowing that he would claim
    to have no recollection of the events.  In fact, however, the witness had
    previously given a statement to the police which incriminated the accused
    in relation to the offences with which she was charged.  The procedure followed
    by Crown counsel was to have the witness read the entire prior statement,
    small portions at a time, and then ask the witness whether he recalled the
    statement and whether it was true.  The witness consistently took the position
    that he could not recall the statement.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Through
    this tactic, the Crown effectively got a version of the events before the
    jury that the British Columbia Court of Appeal held the jury would not likely
    be able to erase from its mind, in spite of the trial judge’s charge that
    the statement had not been adopted by the witness and could therefore only
    be used to assess the witness’ credibility.  The Court acknowledged that
    there was good reason to permit the cross-examination, because “[u]ntil it
    is completed, one cannot know whether the witness who has made an inconsistent
    statement will yield and admit the truth of the statement” (<i>supra</i>,
    at 557-558).  However, the Court held that, in the circumstances, the prejudice
    of the procedure that had been followed far outweighed the probative value
    of the evidence obtained –
    which, in the result, was nothing – and therefore that the evidence must
    be excluded.  Two excerpts from the decision of Seaton J.A., at 558 and 559,
    summarize the Court’s view:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>By this method of cross-examination all that was gained, and
    one gets the feeling all that was sought, was to have Mr. Barnes read the

    the examination and maximize the prejudice.  The result was devastating to
    the defence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    this detailed and direct eye-witness account when it considered the scattered

    the appellant submits the effect of permitting the Crown to cross-examine
    Mr. Clift on his December 14 statement was the same –
    particularly given the portion of the videotaped statement in which he demonstrated
    what he said was the appellant’s action in tripping Matti Baranovski.  The
    Crown initially adopted a tactic similar to that in <i>Fraser</i>, although
    it did not ask Mr. Clift to read the portions of the statement himself, as
    had been the case in <i>Fraser</i>.  The Crown read out extracts from the
    December 14 statement, then asked Mr. Clift if he recalled being asked the
    questions and giving the answers, and if they were true.  Walter Clift consistently
    repeated that he did not know if his answers to the police were true because
    he had just been repeating what others had told him. The Crown would then
    read out a further series of extracts from the statement, and the same exercise
    would be repeated.  At one point the defence objected, submitting that it
    was clear the witness was not going to adopt his prior statement and that
    the questioning was prejudicial and of no evidentiary value.  The trial judge
    immediately directed the Crown to adopt a more concise procedure of asking “rolled-up” questions
    instead of asking several questions on the same issue and to stick to questions
    on material inconsistencies which were unlikely to involve hearsay.  Appellant’s
    counsel submits this was not enough.</p>

    experienced trial judge in this case decided to permit the s. 9(2) cross-examination.  He
    concluded that the principles of <i>Soobrian</i> did not apply because the
    Crown had not called Walter Clift solely for the purpose of discrediting
    him.  Moreover, in keeping with the observation in <i>Fraser</i>, he adopted
    the view that it could not be said at that stage in the proceedings that
    the cross-examination would be useless.  He attempted to control the situation
    by ruling that the Crown could cross-examine on prior inconsistent statements <i>on
    material issues</i> given in the December 14 statement and at the preliminary
    inquiry, and by stating that he would resolve disputes over the evidence
    being led on an issue-by-issue basis.  As indicated above, that is exactly
    what he did.</p>

    to the jury on the use they could make of Walter Clift’s testimony, immediately
    after that testimony – something that was missing in both <i>Soobrian</i> and <i>Fraser</i>.  He
    told the jury that prior inconsistent statements are not evidence unless
    they are adopted at trial by the witness; that they had to be careful to
    remember that “agreeing that he said these things on earlier occasions is
    not the same as agreeing that those statements were the truth”; and that
    Mr. Clift did not adopt many of the statements.  </p>

    statements that Mr. Clift had acknowledged making but did not adopt, and
    told the jury that as a matter of law there was <u>no evidence</u> on these
    points from Mr. Clift.  These examples covered the potentially most damaging
    aspects of the statement that were read in.  In this respect he told the
    jury:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    evidence given thus far where he did not adopt statements that he acknowledged

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    robbing or tripping Mr. Baranovski.  <u>Again, this means that there is no

    true, and that they could not use the earlier statements
    – including that of Walter Clift – as evidence of what actually happened
    unless they were satisfied that the witness accepted it as true while in
    the witness box.  The trial judge omitted to repeat his specific mid-trial
    instruction with respect to Walter Clift in his charge to the jury – as he
    had said he would do – but he returned to it in the re-charge.  He repeated
    the instruction about not using the statement for the truth of its contents

    permissible.  The problem in that case was in the lack of a strong direction
    in the jury charge to balance the jury’s consideration of the credibility
    question regarding the impugned witness.  Here, as noted above, the trial
    judge twice gave a very strong and clear instruction on what use the jury
    could make of Walter Clift’s prior statements and – of at least equal significance – on
    what evidence the statements could not constitute.  In short, he did exactly
    what the Court said the trial judge in <i>Soobrian</i> should have done:
    he told the jurors there was no basis upon which they could “draw an adverse

    he submits that the trial judge was required to – but did not –
    instruct the jurors that to find the appellant guilty of being a party to
    manslaughter they had to be satisfied the appellant knew (had subjective
    foresight) when he pushed Matti Baranovski to the ground that the other perpetrators
    would come in and start kicking Matti after the initial push or trip.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    link the evidence that was significant to the theory of the defence to the
    principles of law he had enunciated with respect to the party-to-manslaughter
    offence: see <i> R. v. Jacquard</i> (1997), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 1  at 10-12,

line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Litkowski says the trial judge got it right in his discussion with counsel
    during the objection to his charge, but failed to convey the correct message
    to the jury.  During the post-charge discussion the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>I want to be as frank with you as I can.  I came to the conclusion that
    as a matter of law, if the tripper should have foreseen the kickers coming,
    objectively that wouldn’t be enough.  The tripper had to subjectively foresee
    that the kickers were going to come in.  If the tripper subjectively foresaw
    that and then acted by tripping with the intention of aiding and abetting
    […] the […] kickers, […] and also with the objective foresight that injurious
    bodily harm would ensue, then that would support the conviction for manslaughter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, however, the trial judge did convey the message to the jury that
    he indicated was appropriate in his post-charge discussion with counsel,
    albeit not in the concise three-sentence summary that the appellant favours.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    began this portion of his charge by telling the jury that a verdict of manslaughter
    could be reached in one of two ways: (a) if a defendant kicked Matti but
    did not have the requisite intention for murder, or (b) if a defendant did
    not kick Matti but was proven to have aided or abetted the kickers.  “The
    other route to manslaughter applies,” he repeated, “if you are not sure if
    a defendant kicked but are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he was
    a party to the kicking by aiding or abetting the kickers.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the ensuing part of the charge on this point, the trial judge essentially
    instructed the jurors they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt on
    four elements in order to convict one or more of the accused of being a party
    to the offence of manslaughter.  He did so – properly, in my view – by dealing
    first with aiding and abetting (i.e., the “party” issue, which encompassed
    the first three elements) and then turning to the objective element of manslaughter
    (the fourth element).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relation to aiding and abetting, the trial judge told the jurors they must
    be satisfied (i) that the person alleged to have been a party was <i>present</i> at
    the scene of the assault or was close to the victim when he was being kicked,
    (ii) that the presence or conduct <i>had the effect</i> of aiding or encouraging
    the perpetrators to commit the offence, and (iii) that the person alleged
    to have been a party must have <i>intended</i> to aid or encourage the assault.  In
    the context of this latter subjective mental element for aiding and abetting – intent – the
    trial judge told the jury (amongst other ways) that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>an accused person could aid or encourage the assault by knocking the victim
    to the ground <i>while knowing that [the victim] is likely then to be assaulted</i> [Emphasis
    added.] </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally – turning
    to the manslaughter aspect of the offence of being a party to manslaughter – the
    trial judge instructed the jurors that they must be satisfied on an objective
    standard that a reasonable person would realize the assault would lead to
    serious bodily harm (by which he said he meant bodily harm that was neither
    trifling nor transient).  The trial judge repeated these instructions during
    his charge, and did so again in response to a post-charge question from the
    jury.  At one point he succinctly summarized the four elements by reminding
    the jurors they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt as to presence,
    effect, intent to aid or abet, and that a reasonable person would foresee
    the likelihood of injurious bodily harm.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    see no error in this charge.  The jurors could have been left in no doubt
    that they must be satisfied as to a subjective element of intent in relation
    to aiding and abetting and that one way in which that intent could be established
    – as the trial judge said – was by the pusher “knocking the victim to the
    ground <i>while knowing that he [was] likely to then be assaulted</i>”.  In
    my opinion, it was not necessary for the trial judge to go further and to
    tell the jurors they must be satisfied the appellant knew Matti Baranovski
    was likely to be <i>kicked</i>, as Mr. Litkowski contends.  All the appellant
    needed to know was that the victim was likely to be assaulted in some fashion.  There
    is no need to foresee the exact nature of the assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Litkowski places particular emphasis on the following passage from the trial
    judge’s charge:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>So let me <i>summarize
      this instruction</i> one more time.  If you conclude that your are sure
      that the person was a party to the assault, and if you conclude that a
      reasonable person seeing a group of people kicking a person repeatedly
      in the head while he is lying motionless on the ground would know that
      he was likely to receive more than minor injuries, then the Crown has proved
      that person guilty of manslaughter.  It does not matter whether he expected
      the person to die or not. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    argues that this comment – given even more force by the word “summarize”,
    because the jury would think it represented the real essentials of the charge – removed
    the subjective element from the jury’s contemplation and left them with the
    impression that they need not consider whether the appellant had the requisite
    knowledge that the others would likely come in and kick Matti Baranovski
    if he pushed the Matti to the ground.  In my opinion, however, this argument
    misconceives the role of this particular passage in the instructions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    charging the jury on party liability to manslaughter, the trial judge had
    to deal with both a subjective and an objective mental element.  The subjective
    element relates to the “party” aspect of the charge (<i>i.e</i>., the aiding
    and abetting aspect), whereas the objective element pertains to the manslaughter
    aspect.  The trial judge made this distinction.  First, he dealt with aiding
    and abetting and the three elements it was necessary for the jury to address
    in that connection (dealing with the subjective element of intention to aid
    or abet the kickers as the third element).  At the conclusion of that segment
    of his charge, he summarized that issue.  He then dealt with the manslaughter
    aspect of party liability to manslaughter, including the objective element
    of foreseeability of serious bodily injury, but not necessarily death.  At
    the conclusion of that segment of the charge, he summarized that issue.  The
    appellant complains about this latter summary.  But the impugned passage
    quite properly dealt with objective foreseeability because it was dealing
    with manslaughter, and I am satisfied the jury would not have been confused
    into believing that the trial judge was giving them a summary of the entire
    charge on party liability to manslaughter at this point.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Litkowski further submits that the trial judge nonetheless failed to relate
    the evidence to the legal principles in question and to the defence position – particularly
    by failing to tie in the kicking aspects of the case to the general legal
    principles regarding party liability for manslaughter.  Again, I do not agree.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    dealing with the positions of the appellant and the Crown in his instructions,
    the trial judge told the jury:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>It is Mr. Fishbayn’s position that even if you find Mr. Mariani was the
    person that pushed Mr. Baranovski to the ground, he is not guilty of manslaughter.  Mr.
    Fishbayn says that to find that Mr. Mariani was guilty of manslaughter, you
    would have to be satisfied that Mr. Mariani knew that the others would move
    in and kick Mr. Baranovski as a result of the push and that he ought to have
    known that bodily harm would result.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Mr. Fishbayn
    relies on the following evidence to show that Mr. Mariani did not know that
    the kicking would result: First, there was no discussion beforehand among
    the people who approached the table about using violence; second, Mr. Lipschitz
    testified that Mr. Mariani looked surprised when the first kick happened.  Mr.
    Lipschitz described the kicking as spontaneous.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>The Crown submits that based on the same evidence, you can infer that if
    a person pushed or tripped Mr. Baranovski to the ground in the circumstances
    of this case, he would have known that others would move in to kick Mr. Baranovski
    and ought to have known that Mr. Baranovski would suffer injury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the trial judge made it clear that mere presence at the scene was not enough
    to establish liability (this was later confirmed in response to a question
    from the jury), nor was the act of simply pushing or tripping Matti and knocking
    him to the ground.  The jurors were well aware that the entire notion of
    party liability to manslaughter was grounded in the “kicking”
    scenario.  It only arose in circumstances where they were not satisfied the
    appellant was one of the kickers but found that others were.  The trial judge
    repeated on several occasions that the third requirement was whether or not
    the person alleged to be a party intended to aid or abet <i>the kickers</i>.  The
    jury could accordingly have been under no misapprehension about the nature
    of the
    “assault” that was the subject matter of the charge in this case and how
    the kicking aspect of that assault related to the appellant’s defence and
    the legal principles involved.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was a reason why the trial judge crafted this portion of the charge in the
    way that he did, without making specific reference to the appellant.  He
    bent over backwards throughout the trial, and in his charge, to be fair to
    the accused.  In particular, he was concerned not to single out the appellant
    unfairly in the portion of his charge respecting party liability to manslaughter
    by placing undue emphasis on the appellant as the possible pusher and tripper.  In
    his post-charge discussions with counsel, immediately following the passage
    cited above, he explained his reasons for framing the charge on this point
    in the fashion that he did:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>When I was trying
    to craft the charge, it ended up I was dealing with parties in terms of the
    people who were near or close to Mr. Baranovski and how liability could attach
    in those circumstances, and I found myself with a separate paragraph dealing
    with the issue of tripping.  And it bothered me because as I read through
    it, it seemed to me it wasn’t a fair balance, because I ended up sort of
    taking Mr. Mariani and treating him differently.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>That’s why I worded this portion of my instruction the way I
    did.  I tried not to overly focus on Mr. Mariani’s conduct.  It seemed to
    me that the defence – it would amount to basically the jury might end up
    with the impression that, you know, I’m saying, look, there’s two ways to
    get to manslaughter, one is if he kicked and if you have a reasonable doubt
    on the intent for murder, and the other is if they are aiders and abettors.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>Now, aiders and abettors, if they’re surrounding the person
    with the intent of aiding and abetting, plus the objective foresight for
    murder, that’s manslaughter.  Now, on top of all that, there’s the situation
    with respect to Mr. Mariani.  If he tripped him and foresaw that the kickers
    were coming, and so on.  I felt that it was going to place an undue spotlight
    on Mr. Mariani, that why I changed it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    trial judge’s charge must be read as a whole in terms of its fairness and
    not parsed excessively by placing undue emphasis on individual portions.  Nor
    is it the function of an appellate court to insist upon what it might consider
    to be other suitable wording, where the charge as a whole identifies the
    legal issues and adequately relates the evidence to those issues and to the
    positions of the Crown and the defence.  As this Court said in <i>R. v. Archer</i> (2005),
    202 C.C.C. (3d) 60, at 78-79:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='

    and the defence.  The fairness of a jury instruction is best measured by
    examining the charge as a whole.  The general tenor of the instruction and

    provide a more accurate insight into its fairness than will a microscopic
    parsing of isolated passages.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    not look to the style or format used by the trial judge, but to whether the
    charge properly instructed the jury as to the relevant law, whether it fairly
    and accurately outlined the position of the parties, and whether it alerted
    the jury to the evidence relevant to the position of the parties: <i>R v.

    fashioning his charge on this evidence, the trial judge had to cope with

    Crown sought to use the evidence of the plan to blame Daniel Weiz as evidence
    of consciousness of guilt on the part of the appellant and Lee Cochrane (they
    each resisted the use of the evidence for that purpose).  Mr. Wiez sought
    to rely on it, however, as evidence that could raise a reasonable doubt about
    his guilt.  In addition, since the source of the evidence was Ms. Kotin,
    the trial judge had to deal with the frailties in her evidence –
    discussed in the earlier portion of these reasons dealing with the <i>Vetrovec</i> issue.</p>

    the pre-charge submissions the trial judge ruled that the evidence of the
    plan to blame Daniel Weiz was capable of providing evidence of consciousness
    of guilt.  He began this portion of his charge by reminding the jury that
    Natalie Kotin and Yavi Lipschitz were good friends and that there was a danger
    they may have colluded about their evidence and that Ms. Kotin was not being
    truthful about what she claimed the appellant or Mr. Cochrane said about
    the plan to blame Daniel Weiz.  He pointed out that Ms. Kotin could not remember
    whether it was the appellant or Mr. Cochrane who made the statement, although
    she did testify that whoever made the remark did so in the presence of the
    other.  The trial judge then told the jury:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    I ask you to bear down and bear with me while I try to explain it.  If you
    decide the statement was made either by Mr. Mariani or Mr. Cochrane, then
    you will have to decide whether you think it is safe to conclude that it
    was adopted by the other person.  Was it said within earshot of the other
    person?  Was it said in circumstances where you expect the other person to
    disavow himself of it?  If you think it is unsafe to conclude that it was
    adopted by the other person, then the evidence has no value at all against
    Mr. Mariani or Mr. Cochrane.  Why?  Because Ms. Kotin is unable to tell us
    which of Mr. Mariani or Mr. Cochrane made the statement.  If it was not adopted
    by the other, then you do not know who said it and it is of no value as evidence
    against Mr. Mariani or Mr. Cochrane.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    Mr. Mariani or Mr. Cochrane and adopted by the other, then it is some evidence

    his warning about the frailties of Ms. Kotin’s evidence.  In addition, he
    pointed out that, even if the jurors decided the appellant or Mr. Cochrane
    had adopted the statement of the other about the plan, they should nonetheless
    approach this evidence with caution because it may have been equally consistent
    with the statements of two scared teenagers who did not participate in the
    assault but who were present in the park and were afraid they might be accused
    in the death.  Finally, he told the jury that even if they concluded the
    evidence about the plan to blame Daniel Weiz was not evidence against either
    the appellant or Mr. Cochrane, it was still evidence of the existence of
    a plan to blame Mr. Weiz and was therefore capable of contributing to a reasonable

    issue of the frailties in Ms. Kotin’s testimony relates somewhat to the earlier
    discussion respecting the <i>Vetrovec</i> issue.  For these purposes, however,
    the salient features of these frailties were her friendship with, and the
    possibility of collusion with, Yavi Lipschitz, which may have led her to
    fabricate evidence pointing away from him.  The trial judge reminded the
    jurors of this more than once, and he reminded them as well that Ms. Kotin
    could not remember who it was – as between the appellant and Mr. Cochrane – who
    made the statement about the plan.  The jury would have understood as well,
    from his summary of counsels’ submissions and the positions of the parties,
    that the plan had never been implemented and that Ms. Kotin’s memory was
    weak with respect to who was present at the time of the discussion and who
    made the statements.  The charge, read as a whole, left the jury in no doubt
    about the need for them to be alert to the difficulties with Ms. Kotin’s
    evidence.</p>

    do I find any error in the trial judge’s charge with respect to the need
    for the jury to find that the appellant or Mr. Cochrane had “adopted” the
    statement of the other about the plan to blame Daniel Weiz.  No philosophical
    discussion about the meaning of the word “adoption” is required in such circumstances.  The
    jury was told to weigh whether they were satisfied that the comment had been
    made within earshot and was instructed to consider whether the statement
    (assuming it was found to have been made by one of them) was made “in circumstances
    where you expect the other person to disavow himself of it” before finding
    that it had been adopted.  This was a proper instruction.  Although silence
    alone is not sufficient to create an inference of adoption, as noted by Martin
    J.A., in <i>R. v. Baron and Wertman</i> (1976), 31 C.C.C. (2d) 525 at 539-540

    the

    Antibes group decided to do with respect to the Russians was factually unrelated
    to what they did after that.  The jury might therefore have used the evidence

    assaultive behaviour and therefore that it was more likely that he did so

    evidence about the plan to fight the Russians was not propensity evidence
    as that concept is generally understood.  It was not highly prejudicial evidence
    of past conduct tending to demonstrate that the accused was a person of bad
    character with a general propensity to commit crimes, or crimes of a nature
    similar to the one in question, and therefore was a person more likely to
    have committed that crime in question.  Indeed, it was not evidence of past
    conduct at all.  Instead, it was evidence of the beginning of a continuous
    chain of events that started with the intention to get into a fight with
    the Russians (foiled because the Russians were nowhere to be found) and ended
    with the intention to rob and assault Matti Baranovski and his friends (tragically
    successful because they happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time).</p>

w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">

    ), upon which the appellant relies.  In <i>O’Connor</i> the accused was charged
    with second degree murder.  The victim had won some money playing poker and
    the money was missing after the killing.  The victim and the accused had
    been seen at a charity casino before the killing.  At trial, the Crown sought
    to introduce evidence that the accused had asked one of his friends about
    a week before the killing a question to the following effect:
    “If you were me would you blow somebody’s head off?”  The comment was made
    in relation to the accused’s girlfriend’s ex-boyfriend, not the murder victim.  This
    Court held that the statement should not have been admitted, but if admitted,
    should have been the subject of a direction that the evidence not be used
    to show propensity or bad character.</p>

    however, the situation is different.  In <i>O’Connor</i> the impugned evidence
    related to an event that was clearly separate from the murder with which
    the accused was charged.  It was of little probative value in the murder
    case itself and was held to be inadmissible.  The evidence of the plan to
    fight the Russians was conceded to be admissible as part of the narrative
    and was very likely admissible to show the state of mind of the appellant
    and his co-accused as well.  Moreover, as indicated above, it was directly
    relevant to the circumstances surrounding the attack on Matti Baranovski
    since, as the Crown submitted, it explained how the Antibes group came to
    be in the park that evening, and “how the crosshairs shifted to Matti and
    his friends when the Antibes group did not find their intended targets”.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
