    appellant appeals the dismissal of his application for the appointment of
    an arbitrator.  While I agree that the application judge erred in his analysis
    I would nevertheless dismiss the appeal because the appellant was not a party
    to the arbitration agreement.  The question of the appellant’s status was
    a matter raised by the court at the hearing of the appeal.  I deal with the
    legal issues that the parties disputed as these issues may well arise on
    a renewed, properly constituted application. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    dispute arises out of efforts to develop oil and gas concessions originally
    owned by SloGold Resources Ltd. (“SloGold”) in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Slovak
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    Republic.  The appellant was a major shareholder of SloGold.  SloGold had
    not previously developed the concessions since, according to the appellant,
    SloGold had not been in a position to pay the Slovakian government the licence
    fees and permit taxes.  The respondent Adrian J. Eyre (“Eyre”) entered into
    an agreement with SloGold whereby in return for 60% of the shares in SloGold
    he would raise the necessary capital (<span style='"Times New Roman"'>£</span>2,400,000)
    within a specified period of time to develop the oil and gas concessions.  SloGold
    issued shares to Eyre that gave him a 60% share interest in SloGold.  The
    agreement specifically provided that it would terminate and Eyre would return
    the shares in SloGold if he did not raise the required capital within the
    specified time.  There were several amendments to the agreement, which I
    ignore since they do not affect the legal issues on appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Eyre
    replaced the appellant as President and Director of SloGold.  One of the
    corporate actions he took was to transfer two of SloGold’s concessions to
    a new corporate vehicle, Wharf Resources Plc. (“Wharf”), to avoid all of
    SloGold’s debts on these concessions.  SloGold’s shareholders were to receive
    a 40% interest in Wharf as consideration for the transfer.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Whether
    the necessary capital was not raised or, as Eyre states, the escrow agent
    misappropriated funds, matters not to this appeal.  The material filed indicates
    that SloGold’s share certificate was returned, though it seems that some
    shares may have been sold to third parties.  This too does not matter to
    this appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> What
    does matter, and what is central to the dispute, is that shares in Wharf
    have not been delivered to SloGold’s original shareholders.  Eyre states
    that he is holding them in trust.  The appellant also takes the position
    that Eyre failed to arrange payment of numerous creditors of SloGold as the
    agreement required.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    the appellant gave written notice of the disputes and requested arbitration
    and Eyre refused to proceed with arbitration, the appellant brought his application
    for an order appointing an arbitrator under the<i> Arbitration Act, 1991</i>,
    S.O. 1991, c. 17.  The application judged dismissed the application.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    primary reason the application judge dismissed the application was that the
    contract, and therefore the arbitration clause in it, had terminated.  He
    said the contract was “voided by the fact that two preconditions were not
    met” since the necessary amount of capital had not been raised within the
    specified time period.  Therefore, he concluded “the Agreement has termination
    provisions that kicked in and prevent this Court to name an arbitrator.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the application judge erred by determining whether the agreement
    had terminated and then by concluding the arbitration clause no longer applied.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the position of the appellant was that the agreement remained in force.  Given
    that the requisite capital had not been raised and the share certificate
    had been returned, there was considerable force to the respondents’ position
    the agreement had terminated according to its own terms.  Nonetheless, the
    question of whether the contract had terminated fell within the scope of
    the arbitration clause.  The clause stated that “any question regarding [the
    agreement’s] existence, validity or termination” would be arbitrated.  The
    application judge ought not to have determined whether the agreement had
    terminated.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    even if the contract had terminated, the parties’ obligation to arbitrate
    continued.  The reasoning of the application judge would undermine the resolution
    of disputes by consensual arbitration.  In this case, the parties to the
    contract had agreed to arbitrate any dispute “arising out of” the agreement, “including
    any question regarding its termination”.  These words indicate they contemplated
    that the agreement to arbitrate could be invoked after the agreement may
    have terminated.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Even
    in the absence of such clear wording I would conclude the arbitration clause
    continued to oblige the parties to submit to arbitration after the contract’s
    termination in the circumstances of this case.  The comments of Lord MacMillan
    in <i>Heyman v. Darwins, Ltd.</i>, [1942] 1 All E.R. 337 at 347 (H.L.), are
    apropos:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I venture
    to think that not enough attention has been directed to the true nature and
    function of an arbitration clause in a contract.  It is quite distinct from
    the other clauses.  The other clauses set out the obligations which the parties
    undertake towards each other <i>hinc inde</i>; but the arbitration clause
    does not impose on one of the parties an obligation in favour of the other.  It
    embodies the agreement of both parties that, if any dispute arises with regard
    to the obligations which the one party has undertaken to the other, such
    dispute shall be settled by a tribunal of their own constitution.  Moreover,
    there is this very material difference that, whereas in an ordinary contract
    the obligations of the parties to each other cannot in general be specifically
    enforced and breach of them results only in damages, the arbitration clause
    can be specifically enforced by the machinery of the Arbitration Acts.  The
    appropriate remedy for breach of the agreement to arbitrate is not damages
    but its enforcement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    distinct nature of an arbitration clause must be recognized.  This case falls
    under the general proposition that parties who have included an arbitration
    clause in their contract will continue to be obliged to submit disputes “arising
    from,” “in respect of,” “with regard to,” or “under” the contract, to arbitration
    in accordance with its terms despite the contract’s expiration or termination.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge identified other matters he regarded as obstacles to the
    appointment of an arbitrator.  These do not provide any basis for refusing
    to enforce the arbitration clause.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    there are no “rules of the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Permanent Arbitration Court attached to the Chamber of Commerce in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">England</st1:country-region>
    ” as contemplated by the arbitration clause.  The application judge found “that
    the arbitration agreement does not contain the rules for an arbitrator to
    govern and as such the agreement is fatally flawed.”  I do not agree.  The
    procedural question of how the arbitration would proceed was not a concern
    of the application judge.  It is a question for the arbitral tribunal.  Arbitration
    clauses do not have to, and seldom do, stipulate procedural rules to govern
    the arbitration.  The consequence of there being no rules of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Permanent Arbitration Court is a matter to be addressed in the arbitration.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge also noted the agreement provided for arbitration by three
    arbitrators, whereas the application requested the appointment of only one.  I
    see this as a matter of a detail to be addressed in the relief granted by
    the court.  The court could have appointed three arbitrators, or, since Eyre
    refused to implement the arbitration process, the court could have indicated
    it was appointing one arbitrator to stand as his selection, thus enabling
    the three arbitrators to be empanelled in the manner contemplated by the
    agreement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before
    this court, the respondents advanced new arguments.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    they argued that the Settlement of Disputes clause was not an arbitration
    clause.  The respondents relied upon the last sentence of the clause to submit
    that the contract contemplated the parties’ recourse to the civil courts
    and therefore there was no arbitration agreement.  This argument has no merit.  The
    last sentence of the clause merely indicates the agreement of the parties
    that, to the extent there is recourse to the courts, such recourse must be
    to the Canadian courts.  An application such as this, for example, must be
    brought in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    they submitted that the application could not be granted because it should
    have been brought under<i> </i>the<i> International Commercial Arbitration
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I-9, rather than<i> </i>the<i> Arbitration Act</i>.  They
    did not identify any material procedural or substantive difference that would
    result.  Both statutes provide for the appointment of arbitrators to implement
    arbitration agreements and both empower arbitrators to determine their own
    jurisdiction.  The source of arbitrators’ jurisdiction is the arbitration
    agreement and not the statute under which they are appointed.  An arbitrator
    appointed by the court pursuant to an arbitration agreement exercises the
    same jurisdiction as an arbitrator consensually selected by the parties.  I
    do not regard the Act under which the arbitrator is appointed to be significant.  If
    a dispute arises between the parties as to which statute governs the arbitration,
    it is a question for the arbitration tribunal to decide.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nevertheless,
    despite my finding that the application judge erred and my rejection of all
    the arguments advanced by the respondents, I would dismiss the appeal.  The
    application judge achieved the correct result by dismissing the application
    brought by the appellant.  The appellant was prior to the agreement the major
    shareholder and President of SloGold.  The parties to the agreement that
    contained the arbitration clause were Eyre and SloGold.  However, the appellant
    brought the application in his own name.  As he is not a party to the arbitration
    agreement, he cannot invoke it.  Other remedies may be available to him.  It
    is not for us to decide.</p>

    the respondents have been successful, the disposition of costs reflects the
    fact that the appeal was allowed on an issue raised by the court itself and
    that the respondents’ arguments were wholly rejected.  There will be costs
    in favour of the respondents in the amount of $1,000 inclusive of disbursements
    and GST.</p>
