    issue in this case is whether a claim based on allegations that a financial
    institution received interest on cash advances in violation of s. 347(1)(<i>b</i>)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i> is suitable for certification as a class action
    under the <i>Class Proceedings Act, 1992</i>, S.O. 1992, c. 6.  The alleged
    violation of s. 347(1)(<i>b</i>) turns on the fact that the defendant bank
    charges a flat fee (the transaction fee), in addition to compound interest,
    on every cash advance from its credit cards.  Depending on other activity
    in the cardholder’s account and the timing of repayment, it is possible that
    the interest rate calculated in accordance with s.&nbsp;347 will exceed the
    60 per cent maximum prescribed by s. 347.  In these reasons I will refer
    to an effective annual interest rate exceeding 60 per cent as the criminal
    interest rate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiff seeks three types of relief.  First, he seeks a declaration that
    the defendant’s practice violates s. 347 and injunctive relief to prevent
    the defendant from continuing its practice.  Second, he seeks damages for
    breach of contract and restitution for the amounts received by the defendant
    in excess of the permissible interest rate.  Finally, he seeks punitive damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    J., an experienced class proceedings judge, refused to certify the class
    because the restitution and breach of contract claims did not raise common
    issues and because a class proceeding was not the preferable procedure with
    respect to the balance of the claims.  His reasons are reported at (2004), <span
style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>71 O.R. (3d) 741</span>.  A majority of
    the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court (Dunnet and Jennings JJ.) upheld that decision.  O’Driscoll
    J., dissenting, would have overturned the decision and certified the class
    proceedings.  Their reasons are reported at (2005), 78 O.R. (3d) 39.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fundamental question raised by the appeal is whether a class proceeding is
    appropriate where <i>all</i> members of the class are at risk of being charged
    a criminal interest rate and thus, potential beneficiaries of the declarative
    and injunctive relief sought, but <i>only some</i> of the members – a much
    smaller number of the class – were actually victims of the defendant’s practice
    and thus, entitled to damages and restitution.  A related issue is whether
    a class proceeding is the preferable procedure where it is reasonable to
    conclude that some, perhaps many, might actually prefer that the alleged
    illegal practice continue rather than risk losing the benefit of taking cash
    advances on their credit card or having additional restrictions imposed on
    the size of the advances and repayment terms.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the following reasons I would allow the appeal, set aside the orders of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court and the motion judge, and substitute an order granting the
    motion for certification.  In short, it is my view that a trial judge could
    find that this is an appropriate case for an aggregate assessment of monetary
    relief under s. 24 of the <i>CPA</i>.  Accordingly, that section, together
    with the statistical sampling methods permitted by s. 23, will meet the individual
    assessment problem identified by the motion judge.  I am also of the view
    that the motion judge erred in principle in his analysis of whether a class
    proceeding is the preferable procedure.  As the Chief Justice said in <i>Western
    Canadian Shopping Centres Inc. v. Dutton</i>, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 534 at para.
    29, “Without class actions, those who cause widespread but individually minimal
    harm might not take into account the full costs of their conduct”.  In my
    view, this is manifestly a case where a class proceeding is not only the
    preferable procedure, but also the only viable procedure for remedying the
    alleged wrong and calling the alleged wrongdoer to account.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
      FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    facts underlying this action are fully set out in the comprehensive reasons
    of the motion judge.  I will, however, provide a brief summary of the relevant
    facts so that the legal issues can be properly understood.  The defendant
    MBNA is a Schedule II bank under the <i>Bank Act</i>, S.C. 1991, c. 46.  It
    issues MasterCard credit cards.  Cardholders (or customers) can use their
    credit cards to make purchases and to obtain cash advances.  The defendant
    charges a transaction fee for cash advances. At the applicable time, the
    transaction fee charged was the greater of $7.50 or one per cent of the cash
    advanced.  For the purposes of the certification motion only, the defendant
    concedes that the transaction fee falls within the definition of interest
    in s. 347.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to the transaction fee, the cardholder is charged compound interest
    from the day the cash advance is made until it is paid off.  While the cardholder
    is required to pay off a certain minimum amount outstanding on the credit
    card account each month, the cardholder is not required to pay down the account
    to zero every month.  If a cardholder borrows less than $62.30, does not
    engage in any other transactions in the month, and pays off the cash advance,
    including the transaction fee and interest before the end of the month, the
    defendant will receive a payment of interest, as defined in s.&nbsp;347,
    in excess of 60 per cent.  Depending on how quickly the cardholder pays off
    the amounts owing, the effective annual interest rate can be astronomical,
    in the thousands of per cent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    this short explanation foreshadows, many variables influence whether or not
    the defendant receives interest at the criminal rate.  The most important
    are the timing of repayment and other transactions on the account.  For example,
    an isolated cash advance of $62.30, or more, will result in an effective
    annual interest rate of less than 60 per cent if the cardholder simply repays
    in accordance with the required minimum monthly payments.  Similarly, if
    the cardholder uses the credit card to not only make cash advances but to
    purchase goods or services, which do not attract a transaction fee, the effective
    interest rate on the account may or may not exceed 60 per cent.  There are
    various combinations and permutations that affect the interest rate calculation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defendant claims that there is no simple way to determine the interest rate
    that it charged its customers on various transactions.  As of December 2003,
    it had approximately 2.5 million credit card accounts with current charging
    practices.  Between January 2000 and December 2003, there were eight million
    cash advance transactions.  Of these eight million cash advances, 17 per
    cent were for amounts less than $62.00.  It has no electronically-preserved
    data for the period before January 2000 and therefore provided no data as
    to the number of cash advances for that period.  The motion judge described
    the defendant’s position in these terms at para. 36:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It claims that
    it is not possible to determine from its database the effective annual interest
    rate received by it for each cash transaction and that this could be done
    only by manually and individually tracking each advance from the time it
    was made to the time it was repaid in full. Even then, assumptions would
    have to be made about the effect of multiple transactions in the accounts
    in order to determine when a particular advance was repaid in full.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiff does not accept this position.  The motion judge described his
    position in these terms at para. 37:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
style='color:black'>From the information provided in the affidavits filed on
      behalf of the defendant, a forensic accountant retained by the plaintiff
      indicated that he was not satisfied of the accuracy and completeness of
      MBNA's assertion that it cannot determine, on an automated basis, the effective
      annual interest rate it received for each cash transaction. In his opinion,
      if his firm was able to review MBNA's systems with the co-operation and
      assistance of its staff, it would be able to determine if it is possible
      to identify the potential class members and devise a system to do this.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I will discuss later when dealing with the question of common issues for
    the restitution claim, it appears that the motion judge accepted the defendant’s
    position.  As he said at para. 55: “<span style='color:black'>There is, in
    my judgment, insufficient evidence of the likelihood that an appropriate
    electronic system can be developed – and of the cost of doing this – to justify
    certification of the restitutionary issues.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defendant denies that its practice in respect of cash advances violates s.&nbsp;347(1)(<i>b</i>).  It
    relies on a voluntariness defence arising from the decision of the Supreme
    Court of Canada in <i>Degelder Construction Co. v. Dancorp Developments Ltd</i>.,
    [1998] 3 S.C.R. 90 and <i>Garland v. Consumers’ Gas Co</i>., [1998] 3 S.C.R.
    112 (“<i>Garland No. 1</i>”).  Those cases hold that there is no violation
    of s. 347(1)(<i>b</i>) where a payment of interest exceeding 60 per cent
    arises from a voluntary act of the debtor.  The defendant submits that because
    the cardholder can determine when to pay back the cash advance, whether to
    make other purchases, how much to borrow and so on, any payment of interest
    at the criminal rate is voluntary.  The defendant submits that this voluntariness
    defence applies to all of the impugned transactions.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
      REASONS OF THE MOTION JUDGE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge noted that at least with respect to the representative plaintiff
    there was little controversy about the facts; that resolution of the claim
    would depend more on issues of law than issues of fact.  As he said at para.
    17, the principal issue would relate to the interpretation of s. 347 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
style='color:black'>The threshold question, that may determine the outcome of
      the litigation, is whether payments of excess interest on advances obtained
      pursuant to the cardholders agreement are necessarily to be considered
      voluntary. This is, I believe, a question of law as, essentially, it requires
      an elucidation of the definition provided by Major J. [in </span><i>Degelder</i>, <i>supra</i>].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge then identified the central factual issues that would arise
    if the legal issues were determined in the plaintiff’s favour.  Factual investigations
    would be required to identify those cardholders who paid interest at a criminal
    rate and the amount </p>
  <br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>paid in excess of 60 per cent in each case.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  However, he indicated that such investigations
    would be required only in respect of the claim for restitution.  This distinction
    appears to have dominated the motion judge’s reasons and ultimately led him
    to find that a class proceedings is not the preferable procedure.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    reviewing the evidence in much greater detail than I have done here, the
    motion judge turned to the requirements for certification in s. 5 of the <i>CPA</i>.  With
    respect to s. 5(1)(a) – disclosure of a cause of action – as the motion judge
    noted, this issue was to be determined on the basis of the pleadings, including
    the provisions of the cardholders agreement and disclosure statement that
    were to be considered incorporated into the amended statement of claim.  He
    held that the s. 5(1)(a) requirement was made out in respect of the cause
    of action relating to the alleged violation of s. 347 and consequent unjust
    enrichment.  He was also satisfied that a cause of action based on breach
    of contract was made out on the theory that the respondent failed to credit
    excess payments of interest to its customers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the motion judge noted, the requirement in s. 5(1)(b) – existence of a class – posed
    a problem of under and over-inclusion.  The original class proposed in the
    statement of claim was as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
style='color:black'>all persons who (i) hold or have held an MBNA Credit Card
      and (ii) paid, or have been charged, or will pay, or will be charged interest
      on Cash Advances on a MBNA Credit Card since MBNA commenced carrying on
      business in Canada, and the date of judgment in this matter.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    this definition might suffice in respect of the claims for declaratory and
    injunctive relief, it was over-inclusive because it would include a large
    number of cardholders who never paid interest at the alleged criminal rate
    because they (i) never took cash advances or (ii) repaid their advances in
    a manner that did not trigger a criminal interest rate.  These cardholders
    would have no restitution claim and, presumably, for the same reason no claim
    for breach of contract.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge was also of the view that the definition could be criticized
    as under-inclusive because it excludes existing cardholders
    “who have not, and do not, pay interest within the defined period but may
    do so thereafter” [para. 38].</p>

    the end, the motion judge rejected the defendant’s argument that the defined
    class was over-inclusive.  He did so, it seems, on the theory that each member
    of the proposed class was potentially at risk of being charged a criminal
    interest rate and that there was no way to define the class more narrowly.  The
    proposed definition had the advantage of allowing potential class members
    to identify themselves without running afoul of the rule that the class must
    be defined without reference to the merits of the claim.  Thus, the motion
    judge rejected an alternative definition of the class that had been proposed
    by the plaintiff and would have restricted the class to those cardholders
    who made interest payments in excess of an effective annual rate of 60 per
    cent.</p>

    motion judge did, however, reformulate the original class definition because
    of a concern that the definition did not refer to persons who obtained cash
    advances after the date on which notice of certification was given.  Accordingly,
    at para. 43, he proposed the following definition:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span

    motion judge was of the view that issues concerned solely with the rights
    of class members to restitution “would not advance the proceeding sufficiently <span style='color:black'>in
    view of the likelihood that it will be necessary to review the transactions
    of each cardholder in order to identify those who paid interest at a criminal
    rate, the amount of such payments and the variables that affected the rate
    in each case” [para. 53].  In Appendix “A” I have set out the common issues
    proposed by the plaintiff before the motion judge.  Some of the common issues
    rejected by the motion judge were: whether the defendant was required to
    pay to the class, as restitution, the transaction fees or, alternatively,
    the interest it has received from the class that exceeds an effective annual
    interest rate of 60 per cent and whether the cash advance transaction fee
    was incurred voluntarily by the class so as to give rise to a defence of
    voluntariness.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge’s finding that there were not appropriate common issues in respect
    of the restitution claim depended, in part, on his view that since it was
    unlikely that an electronic system could be developed to identify the transactions
    on which an effective interest rate exceeding 60 per cent was paid, the case
    would disintegrate into manually examining millions of transactions.  Even
    if some kind of electronic system could be developed, the expense of this
    exercise would far exceed the benefit to the individual class members given
    the plaintiff’s concession that restitution to individual cardholders would
    be in the neighbourhood of $7.50.  Accordingly, the motion judge refused
    to certify the proceeding in respect of the issues directed solely at the
    restitutionary claims.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge then addressed s. 5(1)(d), the question of preferable procedure,
    in relation to the balance of the claims.  He seems to have found that a
    class proceeding would meet the goals of access to justice and behaviour
    modification.  He did not expressly deal with the third goal
    – judicial economy.  Rather, he found that the preferable procedure requirement
    was not met in relation to the claims for declaratory and injunctive relief
    because if the action succeeded, the defendant would be required to comply
    with the law and compliance with the law would reduce the credit options
    available to consumers.  The basis for this finding was in an affidavit filed
    by the defendant.  In short, the defendant asserted that to avoid receiving
    a criminal interest rate on transactions it could preclude customers from
    drawing less than a certain amount and repaying the advance before a certain
    date.  In the result, customers would end up with fewer options and would
    be required to pay greater amounts of interest.  As the motion judge put
    it at para. 67:  “Given the declaratory and injunctive nature of the relief
    sought by the plaintiff, the right to opt out would provide cold comfort
    to class members who would prefer to pay less interest than to participate,
    as private citizens, in the enforcement of s. 347 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.”</p>

line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge considered that it would still be open to the plaintiff to pursue
    the litigation in his individual capacity, but it was not appropriate to
    force other consumers to join in the proceeding.  As he said at para. 68:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
style='color:black'>Mr. Markson is free to pursue his objective in his individual
      capacity but that does not mean that the court should subject cardholders
      in general to the proceedings when there are reasons why they might well
      consider orders for the declaratory and injunctive relief as not in their
      best interests if they were informed of the likely consequences, and there
      is no evidence to the contrary.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, the motion judge refused to certify the proceeding in relation
    to the claims for a declaration and an injunction.  He nevertheless went
    on to consider the final criterion, the presence of an appropriate representative
    plaintiff.  The principal challenge to Mr. Markson as an appropriate representative
    plaintiff rested with the defendant’s assertion that it had a defence to
    his claim that might not apply to the class as a whole based on evidence
    from which it could be inferred that the plaintiff had deliberately set out
    to create a transaction that resulted in him paying an effective rate of
    interest in excess of 60 per cent.  The motion judge dealt with this issue
    at length and resolved the issue in the plaintiff’s favour.  Since this is
    not an issue on the appeal I will simply say that I agree with the motion
    judge’s analysis.</p>

    surrounding circumstances, “would have to be reviewed in order to determine
    whether interest at an effective annual rate in excess of 60 per cent was

    that receipt arose as a result of a voluntary act and whether, ultimately,

    held that the record before the motion judge disclosed that notwithstanding
    resolution of the proposed common issues, individual issues would have to
    be decided before the defendant’s liability to any class member could be
    determined. Consequently, she concluded, at para. 49, that “the [plaintiff]
    failed to demonstrate that a common trial would adjudicate a substantial
    part of each class member’s claims and thus failed to meet the commonality
    requirement regarding the restitutionary claims.”</p>

    J., dissenting, held that the motion judge erred in several respects.  First,
    he committed the error identified by this court in <i>Carom v. Bre-X Minerals
    Ltd. </i><span lang=EN-US>(2000), 51 O.R. (3d) 236, leave to appeal refused
    [2000] S.C.C.A. No. 660, by finding common issues in relation to some but
    not all of the causes of action notwithstanding the causes of action substantially
    overlapped.  O’Driscoll J. held at para. 43 of his reasons that:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Far from being
    unrelated and disparate claims, in my view, the claim grounded in an alleged
    breach of s. 347 of the Code and the claim grounded in breach of contract
    and calling for restitution all revolve around whether the respondent received
    interest exceeding the rate allowed in s. 347 of the Code from the appellant
    and other members of the class when the cardholders obtained cash advances
    on their individual cards.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the motion judge erred in separating these issues; the plaintiff had provided
    a sufficient basis to conclude that a resolution of common issues relating
    to breach of contract and restitution would, in a significant way, advance
    those claims.  The motion judge also erred in finding that a class proceeding
    was not the preferable procedure because:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Individual
    actions would be cost prohibitive given the small amounts in issue for any

style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There

    O’Driscoll J. was unimpressed with the argument that the plaintiff was not
    a suitable representative plaintiff.  As he said at para. 34, “In a ‘clean
    hands’
    competition between these parties, in my view, the appellant would win in
    a walk.”  He concluded, at para. 60, that
    “this case fits perfectly into the mould designed for class proceedings.”  He
    would therefore have allowed the appeal and certified the class action with

    fundamental problem underlying the question of issues common to the claims
    for restitution and breach of contract is that the defendant has structured
    its affairs such that it is practically impossible to determine the extent
    of its breach of s. 347 of the <i>Criminal Code.</i>  In framing the issue
    in this way, I should not be taken as having found that the defendant deliberately
    structured its affairs to avoid a possible class proceeding or a finding
    that it violated s. 347.  The fact remains, however, that the effect of the
    defendant’s accounting practices is that the precise extent of any violation
    of s. 347 can be determined only at great cost.</p>

    and identify the individual cardholders who would be entitled to restitution
    or damages for breach of contract, I have not been persuaded that the motion
    judge’s finding to the contrary is unreasonable.  Accordingly, if the millions
    of transactions have to be examined individually, the motion judge is undoubtedly
    correct that those claims are not suitable for certification; the time and
    cost to determine the size of the liability in relation to each member of
    the class would overwhelm the common issues.  However, if the motion judge
    is correct in finding that each transaction would have to be examined individually,
    the allegedly illegal conduct of the defendant will continue and its customers

    the common issues relating to the application for a declaration and injunctive
    relief were to be determined in the plaintiff’s favour, the trial court will
    have found that the defendant received interest in excess of an effective
    annual rate of 60 per cent on cash advances.  Thus, liability to some class
    members will have been established.  At least some members of the class would
    therefore be entitled to a remedy, either by way of restitution or damages
    for breach of contract.  In my view, those two findings – liability and entitlement
    to a remedy –
    are sufficient to trigger the application of ss. 23 and 24.  </p>

    I have said, because of the way the defendant has structured its affairs
    it is practically impossible to determine the extent of its breach of s.
    347.  Once the common issues are resolved, it would be possible to review
    the statements of each individual cardholder and calculate the cardholder’s
    damages. The vast number of accounts to be reviewed and the small potential
    award in each case are such that it is impractical and inefficient to do
    so.  Sections 23 and 24 provide a means of avoiding the potentially unconscionable
    result of a wrong eluding an effective remedy.  </p>

    (c) the aggregate or a part of the defendant’s liability to some or all class

    difficult issue in this case is whether s. 24 can apply where, as here, it
    is alleged that whether or not an individual was affected by a breach of
    contract or violation of the <i>Criminal Code</i> can only be done on a case-by-case
    basis.  This depends on an interpretation of s. 24(1).  Section 24 has received
    relatively little attention in the reported cases: see e.g. <i>Serhan Estate

    certification stage the plaintiff need only establish that “<span lang=EN>there

    monetary relief is claimed on behalf of the class.  As to condition (c),
    statistical sampling –

    defendant submits that liability turns on individual assessments and therefore,
    resolution of common issues concerning the alleged breach of s. 347 and breach
    of contract would not establish its liability to any particular customer.  If
    the defendant is correct, the kind of action sought to be pursued in this

    where potential liability can be established on a class-wide basis, but entitlement

    an allegation that the defendants received a criminal rate of interest on “payday
    loans”.  At the time the loan is advanced to the customer, the customer provides
    a personal cheque payable to the lender for a period ending one day after
    the stated due date of the loan (being the day before the borrower’s payday).  If
    the customer is able to pay off the loan before the due date by paying the
    principal amount and the accumulated interest (at a rate of 59% per annum)
    there is no cheque cashing fee.  If, however, the lender needs to pay off
    the loan by cashing the personal cheque, certain cheque cashing and other
    fees are triggered, potentially also triggering a criminal interest rate
    if those fees come within the definition of interest in s.&nbsp;347.  As
    in this case, the <i>National Money Mart </i>defendants argued that the voluntariness
    defence was applicable and would have to be determined on an individual basis.  Hoy

    defendant may well be right that since the customer can choose the amount
    of the cash advance, when to repay it and whether to make additional credit
    purchases, the payment of interest at a criminal rate arises from a voluntary
    act of the debtor.  However, that defence would apply across the class.  It
    is not apparent to me why decisions, such as the date of repayment, would
    give rise to a voluntariness defence in one case and not another.  At least
    at this stage, I cannot see why it will be necessary to determine the application
    of the defence on an individual basis.  Accordingly, in my view, the possible
    availability of a voluntariness defence does not stand in the way of certification.  I
    would therefore include the following as a common issue:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
style='color:black'>If MBNA received interest at an effective annual rate in
      excess of 60 per cent on cash advances made under agreements or arrangements
      with class members, did payment of interest at that rate arise from the
      voluntary acts of the class members so as to give rise to a “voluntariness
      defence” thereby precluding a violation of s. 347 of the <i>Criminal Code
      of Canada</i>?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    conclude on this aspect of the case, in my view there are common issues in
    relation to the claims for restitution and breach of contract.  In fairness
    to the motion judge and the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court, I have reached this conclusion because of the application
    of ss. 23 and 24 of the <i>CPA</i>, matters that were not raised before those
    courts.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(c)       Preferable

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    though the motion judge found that there were common issues in relation to
    the claims for injunctive and declaratory relief, he held that a class proceeding
    was not a preferable procedure because if the action was successful and the
    defendant was forced to comply with the law, its <span
style='color:black'>customers would end up with fewer options and would be required
    to pay greater amounts of interest.  Yet, the motion judge recognized that
    the plaintiff could pursue an individual action.  In my view, the motion
    judge erred.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the findings of the motion judge are fundamentally inconsistent.  If the
    plaintiff did pursue an individual action and obtained a declaration or injunction
    I cannot imagine why the consequence would be any different than a class
    proceeding.  Surely, the defendant bank would comply with the injunction
    or conduct its business in accordance with the declaration and stop violating
    the law, not just in relation to this plaintiff, but for all of its customers.  Thus,
    whether the issue were pursued as an individual action or a class proceeding,
    the customers would be deprived of certain options.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    only significant result of refusing to allow this action to go forward as
    a class proceeding but permitting the plaintiff to pursue his individual
    action is that the defendant, even if found to have violated the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> and breached its contract with its customers, will not be required
    to disgorge the illegal profit.  In the result, customers will not only lose
    the options referred to by the motion judge, but they will also receive no
    recompense for past illegal acts by the defendant.  In my view, this is not
    a reasonable result. To a similar effect see <i>1176560 Ontario Ltd. v. Great
    Atlantic &amp; Pacific Co. of Canada Ltd.</i> (2002), 62 O.R. (3d) 535 at
    para. 45 (S.C.J.), aff’d [2004] O.J. No. 85 (Div. Crt.). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Second,
    in my view, the motion judge erred in failing to apply the criteria for preferable
    procedure as articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada.  A succinct statement
    of the applicable principles is set out in <i>Hollick, supra</i>, at paras.
    27 to 31.  I would summarize those principles as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(1)       The
    preferability inquiry should be conducted through the lens of the three principal
    advantages of a class proceeding: judicial economy, access to justice and
    behaviour modification;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(2)       “Preferable” is
    to be construed broadly and is meant to capture the two ideas of whether
    the class proceeding would be a fair, efficient and manageable method of
    advancing the claim and whether a class proceeding would be preferable to
    other procedures such as joinder, test cases, consolidation and any other
    means of resolving the dispute; and, </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(3)       The
    preferability determination must be made by looking at the common issues
    in context, meaning, the importance of the common issues must be taken into
    account in relation to the claims as a whole.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I read the cases from the Supreme Court of Canada and appellate and trial
    courts, these principles do not result in separate inquiries.  Rather, the
    inquiry into the questions of judicial economy, access to justice and behaviour
    modification can only be answered by considering the context, the other available
    procedures and, in short, whether a class proceeding is a fair, efficient
    and manageable method of advancing the claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have said, the motion judge appears to have accepted that a class proceeding
    would meet the goals of behaviour modification and access to justice.  For
    the reasons that follow, I agree with that conclusion.  The defendant has
    said that it will continue to conduct business in a manner that may violate
    the law until presumably the law is changed or it is required to stop by
    court order.  A class proceeding would therefore meet the goal of behaviour
    modification.  While presumably an individual action that resulted in an
    injunction or declaration would achieve the same result, a class proceeding,
    unlike an individual action, will also have the advantage of requiring the
    defendant to account for the economic harm it has caused.  As Doherty J.A.
    observed in <i>Hickey-Button v. Loyalist College of Applied Arts &amp; Technology</i> (2006),
    267 D.L.R. (4th) 601 at para. 58 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), “Accountability is an important first step toward behaviour modification”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, access to justice overwhelmingly favours a class proceeding.  The
    amounts involved are so small that no litigant would have an interest in
    pursuing an individual claim.  The legal and other fees to pursue the claim
    would be hugely disproportionate to the amounts in issue in any individual
    claim.  No other viable procedure has been identified to resolve the claims.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    goal of judicial economy also favours a class proceeding.  Admittedly, maximum
    judicial economy will result if this action is not certified, in that no
    claim would be advanced at all.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[8]</span></span></span></a>  However, this result hardly strikes me as what
    the courts had in mind in terms of judicial economy.  Moreover, it would
    be an overly rigid interpretation of the <i>CPA</i> and inconsistent with
    the instruction in <i>Hollick</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 15 that “courts
    not take an overly restrictive approach to the legislation, but rather interpret
    the Act in a way that gives full effect to the benefits foreseen by the drafters.”  I
    agree with Winkler J. in <i>1176560 Ontario Ltd.</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para.
    45 that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Arguments that
    no litigation is preferable to a class proceeding cannot be given effect.  If
    there is any basis to this argument, it is subsumed in the cause of action
    element of the test for certification.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    judicial economy should focus on the relationship of the common issues to
    the other issues in the case.  Viewed from this perspective, a class proceeding
    is not inconsistent with judicial economy.  If I am right that the voluntariness
    defence can be determined on a class-wide basis and that ss. 23 and 24 can
    resolve the issues of quantum and distribution of the monetary award, the
    entire case will be determined by resolution of the common issues.  It will
    not be necessary to engage in trials of any individual issues.  A class proceeding
    in this case would achieve litigation efficiency in the sense referred to
    in the <i>Report of the Attorney General’s Advisory Committee on Class Action
    Reform</i> (Ontario: Ministry of the Attorney General, 1990) at 15, in providing “an
    efficient means to achieve redress for widespread harm or injury by allowing
    one or more persons to bring the action on behalf of the many.”<a href="#_ftn9"

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    class proceeding will be a fair, efficient and manageable way of advancing
    the claim.  It may be that some customers of the defendant would prefer that
    it continue to have the right to break the criminal law (if it is doing so),
    in order to offer its customers some added advantages.  In this sense, allowing
    the plaintiff to pursue a class proceeding may be seen as unfair to some
    of the customers.  In an organized society however, I do not see this as
    the kind of fairness concern that should prevent a court from intervening.  Rather,
    the concern should be whether the defendant is acting in accordance with
    the law. As Iacobucci J. said in <i>Garland v. Consumers’ Gas Co.</i>, [2004]
    1 S.C.R. 629 at para. 57,  “As a matter of public policy, a criminal should
    not be permitted to keep the proceeds of his crime”.</p>
