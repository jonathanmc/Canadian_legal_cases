    is a Crown appeal from the decision of Ian Gordon J., which dismissed a <i>certiorari</i> application
    from the decision of the preliminary inquiry judge, Lebel J., who declined
    to commit the respondent for trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown argues that the <i>certiorari</i> judge erred in failing to find that
    the preliminary inquiry judge erred, first, by failing to consider the whole
    of the evidence and, second, by impermissibly weighing competing inferences.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent mother of six-week old twin boys was charged with aggravated assault
    and failing to provide the necessaries of life on the basis of multiple injuries
    suffered by the boys over the course of several weeks.  The boys’ father
    was committed to trial without opposition on the same charges.  The aggravated
    assault charges against the respondent relate directly to the boys’ injuries,
    while the failure to provide necessaries charges relate to the allegation
    that the respondent should have known of the boys’ injuries from the distress
    they would have exhibited even if those injuries had been inflicted by their
    father. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Regarding
    consideration of the totality of the evidence, the basic principle is not
    in dispute.  The preliminary inquiry judge’s reasons must demonstrate that
    he or she considered the whole of the evidence:  <i>R. v. Deschamplain</i>,
    [2004] 3 S.C.R. 601 at para. 34.  As the <i>certiorari</i> judge noted, it
    would have been preferable and prudent if the preliminary inquiry judge had
    specifically dealt with all the facts relied upon by the Crown, including
    the respondent’s opportunity to inflict the injuries, the multiple nature
    of the injuries and the distress that the babies would have exhibited at
    the time the injuries were inflicted.  However, as also noted by the <i>certiorari</i> judge,
    an examination of the record as a whole established that the preliminary
    inquiry judge was alive to and did consider the whole of the evidence, including
    these facts.  We agree and see no basis to come to a different conclusion. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Regarding
    the weighing of competing inferences, again the basic principles are agreed.  The
    preliminary inquiry judge must come to a conclusion about the field of permissible
    inferences from the evidence and must not improperly engage in weighing inferences.  Where
    the evidence is circumstantial, however, the preliminary inquiry judge must
    engage in a limited weighing exercise in order to determine whether a properly
    instructed jury could reasonably draw the suggested inferences. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Here,
    the <i>certiorari</i> judge concluded that the preliminary inquiry judge
    engaged in no more than the limited weighing that is permissible at a preliminary
    inquiry.  The Crown submitted that an inference could reasonably be drawn
    from the fact that the respondent had the opportunity to inflict the injuries;
    however, that opportunity was not exclusive.  As well, the Crown argued that
    the fact the respondent sought regular medical attention for the boys could
    lead to the inference that the respondent knew of their injuries.  The preliminary
    inquiry judge clearly concluded that this inference could not reasonably
    be drawn on the whole of the evidence, including the evidence about the father,
    the evidence of the grandmother and the medical evidence.  The combination
    of that evidence made such an inference speculative.  Again, we see no basis
    on which to interfere with that conclusion.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    we would dismiss the appeal. </p>
