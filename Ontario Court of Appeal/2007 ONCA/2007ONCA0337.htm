    both this appeal and the companion appeal in <i>R. v. Shipman</i> (Docket

    their own communities had no specific treaty reference for hunting.  In both
    appeals the appellants sought to establish their own connection to the hunted
    lands on the basis of their relationship with aboriginal communities that
    have unchallenged treaty hunting rights over the lands in issue.  </p>

    Ontario.  His community enjoys hunting rights under Treaty 9.  At trial,
    and on the appeal to the Ontario Court of Justice, he took the position that
    he could exercise his Treaty 9 hunting rights near Sioux Lookout, which is
    in Treaty 3, based on his marriage to a member of the Lac Seul First Nation,
    a signatory to Treaty 3.    </p>

    Meshake was hunting moose near Sioux Lookout in Treaty 3 territory.  In defence
    of a charge of hunting moose without a provincial licence, contrary to s.
    47(1) of the <i>Game and Fish Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. G.1,<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    insulated from conviction by the constitutionally protected Treaty 9 right
    to hunt. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Meshake’s trial proceeded over six days in Provincial Offences Court.  He
    defended the charge on two grounds: (i) that he has a protected s. 35(1) <i>Constitution
    Act, 1982</i>, being Schedule B to the <i>Canada Act</i> (U.K.), 1982, c.11,
    kinship treaty right to hunt for moose that cannot be infringed upon by Ontario
    through the licensing restrictions of the <i>Game and Fish Act</i>; and (ii)
    Treaty 9 contains no geographic restrictions on his ability to hunt as an
    Aboriginal person and as such any limitation imposed by Ontario is of no
    force or effect.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Justice of the Peace accepted Mr. Meshake’s first argument that he has a
    protected s. 35(1) <i>Constitution Act</i> treaty right to hunt.  She found
    it was unnecessary to address the second argument regarding any geographic
    restrictions in Treaty 9 on his ability to hunt.  The Justice of the Peace
    acquitted him.  The Crown appealed the acquittal to the Ontario Court of
    Justice where the appeal was allowed, the acquittal was set aside, and a
    conviction was entered.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Justice of the Peace found that the evidence established that cross-boundary
    marriage was “not an uncommon event” and that an Ojibway man would be expected
    to hunt to sustain himself and his family regardless of where he lived.  She
    observed that neither Treaty 3 nor Treaty 9 explicitly discussed the social
    and family aspects of Ojibway life.&nbsp;&nbsp;She then concluded, “I am
    satisfied that the government and its commissioners could not have intended
    that an adult male’s right to hunt was extinguished because he married outside
    of his treaty area.”  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appeal judge disagreed with this finding.  He concluded that since Treaties
    3 and 9 are silent on the issue of marriage, the lack of evidence relating
    to Ojibway culture at the time of the signing of the treaties “should have
    led to a finding that no promise was made”.   </p>

    to appeal to this court was granted by Feldman J.A. on April 10, 2003, on
    the issue of whether Mr. Meshake’s treaty rights allow him, as the spouse
    of a Treaty 3 Nation member, to hunt in the Treaty 3 area.</p>

    Cub Lake Road off of Highway #516 northeast of Sioux Lookout. He was driving
    a pickup truck and he was in possession of a 30-30 rifle and 8 live rounds
    of ammunition.  The rifle was in a case on the seat beside him.  Mr. Meshake
    indicated he had been hunting moose. </p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Meshake submits that Treaty 9 includes a
    “kinship right” that permits him, in certain circumstances, to exercise the
    Treaty 9 right to hunt outside the Treaty 9 territory.  His testimony at
    trial was that as an Aboriginal person he was entitled to hunt in his wife’s
    Treaty 3 area and for that matter throughout
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By
    the time this appeal came on for hearing in this court, the original issue
    for consideration had effectively expanded.  Because of certain concessions
    by the Crown –
    which are set out below – an additional issue to address is whether or not
    Mr. Meshake is entitled to “shelter” under Treaty 3 rights and thereby rely
    on those rights to hunt within Treaty 3 territory.  Although it may appear
    obvious, I will describe the term “shelter” in the context of treaty interpretation
    in more detail below.</p>
  <h4><i><span
style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>Crown Concessions</span></i></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would note at the outset that the analysis of this appeal was greatly assisted
    by three very fair and noteworthy Crown concessions.  First, the Crown accepts
    that had Mr. Meshake been hunting moose in his Treaty 9 territory, the Treaty
    9 right to hunt would have provided him with a valid defence to this <i>Game
    and Fish Act </i>charge.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the Crown accepts that had Mr. Meshake been able to demonstrate that he was
    validly exercising the Treaty 3 right to hunt in Treaty 3 territory, he would
    also have a defence to the charge.  That is to say, if Mr. Meshake was hunting

    the Crown accepts that if, as a matter of law, a defence was available to

    Meshake presents two arguments that support the contention that a “sheltering” defence
    is available to him: first, because Treaty 3 is compatible with his Treaty
    9 argument; or second, because the record supports a finding that he has
    a valid defence under Treaty 3.  I will deal with Mr. Meshake’s submissions
    in order. </p>

    Meshake submits that the right he claims is a Treaty 9 right to hunt within
    a marriage – a kinship custom – that is recognized and reciprocated by the
    Treaty 3 Lac Seul First Nation.  In oral argument, counsel for Mr. Meshake
    likened this analytical concept to that of jurisdictional comity between
    nations.  <span lang=EN-US>I understood the analogy of counsel to be that
    of a code of conduct which different First Nations or Treaty areas observe

    prefer to resolve this appeal on the basis of whether or not Mr. Meshake
    is able to shelter under the rights afforded by Treaty 3.  In taking this
    approach to allow the appeal, it will not be necessary to decide this issue.  However,
    without being taken to have decided the issue of comity – to use the expression
    of counsel - I would simply observe that, the argument may not advance reciprocity
    of treaty rights to any greater degree then that of sheltering, as I explain
    that term below.   </p>

    begin by noting that the Justice of the Peace acquitted Mr. Meshake on the
    basis of his having acquired a kinship right to hunt in Treaty 3 territory
    through marriage.  She specifically declined to decide the broader issue
    of whether Mr. Meshake’s Treaty 9 right to hunt extended to anywhere in

    conducting her analysis, the Justice of the Peace restated the several established
    principles of treaty interpretation set out by the Supreme Court of Canada
    in <i>R. v. Marshall</i>, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 456 (<i>Marshall No. 1</i>).  Moreover,
    in my view, she appears to have made every effort to apply these principles
    in reaching the decision she did.  For purposes of my analysis, however,
    although I am mindful of all the principles, I will primarily focus on the
    interpretation principle that I find to be most salient to this appeal. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Specifically,
    in <i>R. v. Morris, </i>2006 SCC 59, the Supreme Court of Canada noted at
    para. 18 that the language used in treaties often reflected vague vocabulary
    for treaty promises.  In light of this, the court reaffirmed the principle
    that, “[t]he goal of treaty interpretation is to choose from among the various
    possible interpretations of common intention the one which best reconciles
    the interests of both parties at the time the treaty was signed”: see <i>Marshall
    No. 1</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 474.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    other words, the promises in the treaty must be placed in their historical,
    political and cultural contexts to clarify the common intentions of the parties
    and the interests they intended to reconcile at the time.  In this regard
    the Justice of the Peace noted that the treaties themselves give no information
    about how family life, religious practice or trading patterns might be affected
    by the agreements the Ojibway made with the Crown.  She then considered the
    expert evidence and the reasonable interpretations to be made from it and
    at para. 24 held that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Given that clearly stated position [that the Ojibway
    were to remain as independent and self-supporting as possible] and the frequency
    of cross treaty-boundary contact, it would make no sense for the government
    of the day to intentionally restrict hunting to the point where a man, who
    married outside his treaty area, could not provide for himself and his family.  And
    it would have made no sense for the Ojibway, given their tradition of hunting,
    to agree to such a treaty condition. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    she found that Treaty 3 does not contain any wording, nor are there any contemporaneous
    documents or writings, inconsistent with the rights claimed for Mr. Meshake
    and with the customs of the Lac Seul/Treaty 3 community.  Her approach, in
    my view, was wholly in accordance with the established principles of treaty
    interpretation and the evidence supports her conclusions, which reveal no
    palpable and overriding error. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the trial record amply supports the Justice of the Peace’s further
    findings of fact, including her finding that Mr. Meshake was accepted into
    the Treaty 3 community of Lac Seul, that Mr. Meshake has become part of the
    Lac Seul community arising from his marriage to Ms. Carpenter, and that he
    had been accepted within the community and welcomed to hunt with the Carpenter
    family.  The community has recognized the marriage and has welcomed him in.  Their
    son is a registered or status Indian<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span

style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    the evidence supports a finding that Aboriginal peoples would travel to other
    communities to marry and continue to hunt, and it supports an interpretation
    that sharing in community harvests through kinship is in harmony with the
    Ojibway custom of sharing harvests between First Nations and families.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    sum, the record fully supports the Justice of the Peace’s findings of fact
    that Mr. Meshake was hunting moose in accordance with Ojibway custom whereby
    Treaty 3 rights holders had invited and accepted him into their community
    and to share in their treaty harvest.  In other words, the evidence taken
    as a whole supports the conclusion that Mr. Meshake was entitled to shelter
    under Treaty 3.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    was the view of the appeal judge that the lack of direct evidence at trial
    that any specific regular cross-border marriages were taking place when the
    treaty was signed meant that this was neither an ancient practice nor a pre-treaty
    practice or custom.&nbsp;&nbsp;He concluded, therefore, that the trial court’s
    decision that Mr. Meshake had an individual right to hunt in a treaty area
    outside his own through marriage constituted an error in law.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Respectfully,
    this conclusion ignores – and indeed, is contrary to – several important
    principles of treaty interpretation that the Supreme Court of Canada restated
    in <i>Marshall No. 1 </i>at 511-13 such as: in searching for the common intention
    of the parties, the integrity . . . of the Crown is presumed; a technical
    or contractual interpretation of treaty wording should be avoided; and, treaty
    rights . . . must not be interpreted in a static or rigid way.  They are
    not frozen at the date of signature; rather, the interpreting court must
    update treaty rights to provide for their modern exercise.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    modern times, where Canadian society is measured and judged by principles
    such as those enshrined in the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>, the
    Justice of the Peace’s findings would seem to more accurately reflect the
    intent and spirit of the principles of treaty interpretation.  I therefore
    agree with the interpretation of the evidence as found by the Justice of
    the Peace in this regard, and disagree with the difference of opinion expressed
    by the appeal judge.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would observe that, on the appeal to the Ontario Court of Justice, it is
    apparent that the appeal judge decided this case, and reversed the decision
    of the Justice of the Peace, solely on the issue of Mr. Meshake’s rights
    pursuant to Treaty 9.  He did not have the benefit of the Crown’s concessions
    that this court found so helpful, and which were directed at Mr. Meshake’s
    rights, as they might exist, under Treaty 3.  Had he such benefit, I believe
    the appeal judge would likely have decided the appeal in the same way that
    I have.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly – and
    given my opinion regarding Mr. Meshake’s entitlement to shelter under Treaty
    3 – if the <i>Game and Fish Act</i> in these circumstances amounted to a <i>prima
    facie </i>infringement of this constitutionally protected treaty right, the
    province would then have the onus of meeting the justification test established
    in <i>R. v. Sparrow</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 1113-114, and <i>R. v. Badger</i>,
    [1996] 1 S.C.R. 771 at 812.  That is, it would have to establish that any
    infringement of the treaty right by the province acting within its constitutionally
    mandated powers can be justified: see <i>Morris</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para.
    55.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    noted, the Crown accepts that if there is a treaty right to hunt applicable
    to Mr. Meshake, the <i>Game and Fish Act</i> amounts to an infringement without
    justification of that right.  In my view, although the Justice of the Peace
    did not specifically hold that Mr. Meshake’s treaty right to hunt was pursuant
    to a right he acquired through kinship or sheltering under Treaty 3, her
    analysis and findings nevertheless support this result.  Specifically, by
    virtue of Treaty 3 and his marriage to Ms. Carpenter, Mr. Meshake has a defence
    to the <i>Game and Fish Act</i> charge and was properly acquitted by the
    Justice of the Peace. </p>
