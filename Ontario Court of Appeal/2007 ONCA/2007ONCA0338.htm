    both this appeal and the companion appeal in <i>R. v. Meshake </i>(Docket
    C39900), the Aboriginal appellants were convicted for hunting on lands where
    it was asserted that their own communities had no historical practice of
    hunting.  Both appeals concern the sharing of treaty wildlife harvesting
    resources.<a href="#_ftn1"

    of these appeals examines the important issue of whether an Aboriginal person
    can lawfully “shelter” under a treaty that he is not a signatory to.  In <i>Meshake</i>,
    the appellant was from a Treaty 9 community but was hunting in Treaty 3 territory.  Mr.
    Meshake’s sheltering issue arose out of his marriage into a Treaty 3 community.  </p>

    Island has no rights of its own in respect of the Robinson-Superior tract,
    and it is not a signatory to the Robinson-Superior Treaty.  Nevertheless,
    the appellants rely on a connection with a Robinson-Superior Treaty community
    to shelter under that treaty.  The connection, stated briefly, is simply
    one of invitation or permission to hunt by a First Nation within the treaty
    area.  I will say more about this connection below.</p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By
    and large the facts in this case are not in dispute and were presented throughout
    as being agreed upon.  The appellants are members of the Walpole Island First
    Nation community located at the mouth of the St. Clair River in the southwest
    reaches of the province.  In October 2000, they were hunting moose in the
    District of Algoma in the northeast region of the province without the licences
    required by the <i>Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, 1997 </i>(<i>FWCA</i>),
    S.O. 1997, c. 41.  The area in which they were hunting is within the tract
    covered by the Robinson-Superior Treaty of 1850.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  Upon
    returning from the hunt the band office was open and Mr. Shipman advised
    them that he had been hunting and that he had been stopped by Ministry officials.&nbsp;
    The then Chief of the Michipicoten First Nation testified that consent would
    have been extended to the hunting party.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    the community of rights holders that the appellants chose for asserting a
    right to shelter under was that of the Michipicoten First Nation.  Michipicoten
    First Nation is an Ojibway community and a holder of treaty rights under
    the Robinson-Superior Treaty.  </p>

    Robinson-Superior Treaty grants Aboriginal signatories hunting and fishing
    rights over the lands surrendered in the treaty.  I will describe the treaty
    more fully below.  These harvesting rights are treaty rights recognized and
    affirmed in s. 35 of the <i>Constitution Act, 1982</i>, being Schedule B
    to the <i>Canada Act</i> (
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    addition to the agreed facts, the trial evidence about the Robinson treaties
    was presented principally through two experts, anthropologist Paul Driben
    and historian James Morrison.  It is this evidence and its conclusions that
    the parties primarily disagree on, however, the disagreements do not materially
    impact on my analysis.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants were charged and convicted under the <i>FWCA </i>by a Justice
    of the Peace in Provincial Offences Court.  Their convictions were upheld
    on appeal to the Ontario Court of Justice.</p>

    to provide the signatories with the right to continue hunting and fishing

    relevant on this appeal are:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>And the said William Benjamin Robinson of the first
    part, on behalf of Her Majesty and the Government of this Province, hereby
    promises and agrees … to allow the said chiefs and their tribes the full
    and free privilege to hunt over the territory now ceded by them, and to fish
    in the waters thereof<u> as they have heretofore been in the habit of doing</u> ….
    [Emphasis added.] </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    purposes of this appeal, the Crown makes three submissions, two of which
    are significant and very helpful concessions:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.
         In accordance with accepted treaty interpretation principles, the court’s
    determination of the nature and scope of the Michipicoten treaty right to
    hunt “as they have heretofore been in the habit of doing” may be informed
    by Ojibway custom as it existed at treaty time or as it has evolved since;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>2.      If the custom of the Michipicoten at treaty time included
      the sharing of their hunt, they may do so in accordance with that custom
      as a matter of interpretation of Robinson-Superior which grants the right
      to hunt “</span>as they have heretofore been in the habit of doing<span lang=EN-US>”;
      and</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>3.      A proper inquiry into ancestral custom for purposes of interpreting
      Robinson-Superior would necessarily include such topics as:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:
Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>whether
      there was a custom of inviting and accepting others to share in the hunt
      and in the harvesting resources of treaty rights holders;</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>in what circumstances such sharing would take place;</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>the nature and scope of consent or permission typically given; and</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:

      would have authority to give it?</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    in the <i>Meshake</i> appeal, the very fair concessions by the Crown go a
    long way in deciding this appeal.  Stated simply, the Crown concedes that
    the principle of an Aboriginal person sheltering under another’s treaty rights
    is a protected constitutional right, provided it is supported by Aboriginal <span style='color:black'>custom
    as it existed at treaty time or as it has evolved since.  I agree with this
    concession.</span></p>
  <h4><i><span
style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>The Trial and Appeal Decisions</span></i></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    submission of the appellants at trial was that there was implied permission
    at the very least from the Michipicoten First Nation to hunt in its treaty
    area.&nbsp; They argued that when they had asked on previous occasions, permission
    was routinely granted to share in the First Nation’s hunt for one’s own use. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown asserted throughout that none of the defendants had permission in October
    2000 to hunt the area.&nbsp; Further, the Crown argues that the record fails
    to disclose whether such consent would, as a matter of custom, have been
    granted in the circumstances of the present case, or even who would have
    had authority to grant it.  In the absence of such evidence, there is no
    basis for concluding that consent was implied.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    I said, the Justice of the Peace convicted the appellants.  In doing so she
    made two findings and holdings that are particularly relevant on this appeal.  First,
    at para. 63 of her reasons, she found that Aboriginal persons hunting outside
    their treaty area “cannot hunt as a Native without a license”.  She goes
    on at para. 64 to hold that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[The defendants] cannot shelter under another Treaty.
    Rights are derived from the Treaty itself&nbsp;and members of a Treaty cannot
    bestow their rights on others.&nbsp;
    Members of a particular treaty area may invite and give permission with respect
    to another person to hunt, but if that person is not a party to the Treaty,
    they cannot give the person permission to hunt illegally without a licence.  Permission
    on its own, does not give the third party a right in law.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Specifically,
    she held that it is not reasonable to conclude that it was the common intention
    of the parties who signed the Robinson-Superior Treaty in 1850 to believe
    the Ojibway people would have the right to shelter or grant permission to
    outsiders to hunt.&nbsp; Respectfully, as I will explain below, this misstates
    the law.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>Second,
      in interpreting the treaty the Justice of the Peace found at para. 62 that
      the part of the treaty that reads: “and further, to allow the said chiefs
      and their tribes the full and free privilege to hunt over the territory
      now ceded by them” is:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>… clear, concise, unequivocal and straightforward.  The
    statement is neither vague nor ambiguous.&nbsp; Parties to the Treaty may
    hunt over the area ceded. This phrase cannot be categorized as a “doubtful
    expression”, that must be resolved in favour of the Indians.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Regarding
    the decision of the appeal court: I would simply note at this time that the
    appeal judge primarily agreed with the reasons for the decision given by
    the Justice of the Peace and dismissed the appellants’
    appeal.  However, aside from any relevance to this appeal there are some
    concerns that I have regarding the appeal judge’s reasons, which I will address
    later.  </p>

    appellants have advanced two issues:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.
         Does the Michipicoten First Nation treaty right to hunt encompass the
    invitation and acceptance by the First Nation of outsiders to share in their
    treaty resource (i.e. to shelter under the treaty rights)?  And, if so, how
    is their acceptance to be evidenced?  And,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.
         Whether the <i>FWCA’s</i> regulated licensing scheme is invalid, or
    at least inapplicable, to Aboriginal people on the basis that it does not
    provide for priority of the constitutionally protected harvesting rights
    of Aboriginal people.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the answer to the first issue is determinative of the need for this
    court to consider the second.  In this regard, while I would answer the first
    issue in the affirmative, I would nevertheless dismiss the appellants’ appeal.  As
    I explain below, I am satisfied that on the facts of this case, the appellants
    are not entitled to shelter under the hunting rights provided for by the
    Robinson-Superior Treaty.  Accordingly, because the appellants cannot avail
    themselves of a constitutional defence, there is no need to consider the
    validity or application of the <i>FWCA</i>. </p>

    dismissing the appeal, the appeal judge correctly approached his analysis
    of the trial decision primarily on the basis of deference to the Justice
    of the Peace, unless palpable and overriding error could be demonstrated.   Furthermore,
    the appeal judge by and large also correctly summarized the issue before
    him, namely: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This matter is fact driven and dependent to a certain
    extent of the position taken by the learned Justice of the Peace relating
    to the consent, implied consent or no consent as may have been given to Lonnie
    Shipman by the Chief of the Michipicoten Band.</p>

style='color:black'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    in my opinion, the Justice of the Peace made several errors of law in her
    decision, which was wrongly upheld on the appeal.  Nevertheless, as I said,
    I would dismiss this appeal, but for different reasons than those that underlie
    the decisions at trial and on appeal to the Ontario Court of Justice.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>My
    analysis is informed by the Supreme Court of Canada’s recent decision in <i>R.
    v. Morris, </i>2006 SCC 59 and the Crown’s concessions, which neither the
    Justice of the Peace or the appeal judge had the benefit of having.  With
    this I turn first to the trial decision, which I disagree with for two reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>First,
      the Justice of the Peace erred when she held that </span><span
style='color:black'>it is not reasonable to conclude that it was the common intention
      of the parties who signed the Robinson-Superior Treaty in 1850 to believe
      the Ojibway people would have the right to shelter or grant permission
      to outsiders to hunt.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    this decision, and that of <i>Meshake</i>, concludes – and upon which the
    Crown is in accord – Aboriginal persons can, in the right circumstances,
    shelter under another First Nation’s treaty rights.  Thus, it is an error
    to conclude that in all cases an Aboriginal person must be a party to the
    treaty in question or that permission alone cannot provide a right under
    the treaty. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the Justice of the Peace erred in interpreting the treaty as she did at para.
    62 when she referred only to that part which reads, “and further, to allow
    the said chiefs and their tribes the full and free privilege to hunt over
    the territory now ceded by them”.  In her decision, the Justice of the Peace
    held that, “this phrase cannot be categorized as a ‘doubtful expression’,
    that must be resolved in favour of the Indians”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    is an error because the promises included in the treaty include the right
    to hunt as the Ojibway “have heretofore been in the habit of doing”.  Although
    the Justice of the Peace alluded to this aspect of the promise on several
    occasions in her reasons, she ignored it when interpreting the promise.  Her
    trial analysis also required a consideration of this phrase.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>In <i>Morris, </i>the
      Supreme Court of Canada observed at para. 18 </span>that the language used
      in treaties often reflected vague vocabulary for treaty promises.  In light
      of this, the court then reaffirmed the principle that, “[t]he goal of treaty
      interpretation is to choose from among the various possible interpretations
      of common intention the one which best reconciles the interests of both
      parties at the time the treaty was signed”: see <i>R. v. Marshall</i>,
      [1999] 3 S.C.R. 456 (<i>Marshall No. 1</i>), at 4740.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    other words, the promises in the treaty must be placed in their historical,
    political, and cultural contexts to clarify the common intentions of the
    parties and the interests they intended to reconcile at the time. </p>

style='color:black'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  In
    this case – as in <i>Meshake</i> – the treaty itself provides no information
    about how family life, religious practice or trading patterns might be affected
    by the agreement the Ojibway made with the Crown.  Thus, it becomes necessary
    to consider the evidence and the reasonable interpretations to be made from
    it.   </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    found by the Justice of the Peace, there was extensive evidence at trial,
    principally from Mr. Morrison and Dr. Driben, about hospitality, the sharing
    of resources and reciprocity in Ojibway custom.  Indeed, there was evidence
    that there were spiritual consequences for those who did not adhere to the
    custom.  The evidence also suggested that it is an Ojibway custom to grant
    permission to other First Nation groups who wished to hunt for food purposes.  </p>

      Justice of the Peace found at para. 17 “permission, in all probability,
      did occur when an Ojibway from outside another’s territory was travelling
      through”.  She went on, however, to hold at para. 18 that:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>… the evidence heard with respect to permission
    previously given by members of the Michipicoten community, more particularly
    the Chief of the Michipicoten First Nation, was based on respect and good

    in my view, this is where the Justice of the Peace fell into error.  Contrary
    to her holding that the practice of granting permission “has no standing

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    evidence, first of all supports the Justice of the Peace’s conclusion that
    Ojibway custom at the time the Robinson-Superior Treaty was signed included
    the sharing of the resources with others “passing through” with permission.  And,
    as the Crown concedes, <span lang=EN-US>since the custom of the Michipicoten
    at the time of the Robinson Superior Treaty included the granting of permission
    to share their hunt, they can continue to do so “</span>as they have heretofore
    been in the habit of doing<span lang=EN-US>”.  Thus, in the correct circumstances,
    the practice of granting permission to outsiders to share in treaty harvesting
    rights to hunt does have standing in law.</span></p>

      would begin with this perhaps obvious principle; each case should be decided
      on its own unique facts and circumstances.  The language of treaties will
      vary, as will the traditions and values that comprise the related Aboriginal
      customs being considered.  The function of defining the Crown’s additional
      issues – whether in court or through negotiations - must be carried out
      through the application of the principles of treaty interpretation established
      by the Supreme Court of Canada.  This will include the principle that “</span>treaty
      rights . . . must not be interpreted in a static or rigid way.  They are
      not frozen at the date of signature; rather, the interpreting court must
      update treaty rights to provide for their modern exercise”: <i>Marshall

      the Robinson-Superior Treaty, the evidence established that the custom

      seeking food and who were passing through the territory.  Thus, a reasonable
      modern day interpretation would include circumstances where other Aboriginal

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mr. Townshend, counsel for the defendants, has
    asked the court to consider the hospitality reciprocity as being of great
    cultural significance because of the Anishinabe perspective and the social
    institution of the clan system. This was not accepted by Justice of the Peace
    Forth because of the lack of significant evidence as tendered.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In effect this was the year 2000 that the hunting

    if the appeal judge’s view is that modern times have overtaken the Ojibway
    custom of “hospitality and reciprocity”
    in 1850, and as it has evolved, he would be wrong.  As I wrote in <i>Meshake</i> at
    para. 41, this view ignores, and is contrary to, several important principles
    of treaty interpretation that the Supreme Court of Canada restated in <i>Marshall
    No. 1</i> at pp. 511-513 such as: in searching for the common intention of
    the parties, the integrity of the Crown is presumed; a technical or contractual
    interpretation of treaty wording should be avoided; and, treaty rights are
    not frozen at the date of signature.  That is, the interpretation of treaties
    requires an updating of the rights to provide for their modern exercise.  </p>

      the appeal judge makes some findings respecting the Robinson-Superior Treaty
      signatories and their understanding as to their rights to regulate the
      fish and game resource.  Again with respect, there was no foundation or
      requirement for him to do so and his reasons on this point should be ignored.  </span></p>

    rights” generally means the Aboriginal and treaty right of Aboriginal people
    to hunt, fish and trap for food, social or ceremonial purposes.  In <i>Sparrow
    v. The Queen</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1075  the Supreme Court of Canada held
    that, after conservation and other valid legislative objectives, Aboriginal
    rights to fish for food, social and ceremonial purposes have priority over
    all other uses of the fishery.</p>

    observation is based on the probability that several separate First Nation
    communities will exist within the overall treaty area.  Each First Nation
    will no doubt have its own specific territorial boundaries.  I assume, therefore,
    without deciding, that a specific First Nation that grants consent to others
    would not do so without regard to another First Nation’s boundaries.</p>
