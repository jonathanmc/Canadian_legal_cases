      respondent was convicted of sexual assault for performing oral sex on his
      two year old daughter.  The trial judge sentenced the respondent to a one
      year conditional sentence.  Although the Crown gave notice that it would
      also be seeking a DNA databank order under s. 487.051(1) of the <i>Criminal
      Code </i>and an order under s. 490.012(1) that the offender register with
      the sex offender registry, and the respondent’s counsel made no submissions
      in this regard on sentencing, the trial judge did not make the orders.  The
      Crown appeals and asks us to make these orders or, alternatively, to remit
      the matters to the trial judge for submissions with this court’s guidance. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    only reason given by the trial judge for refusing to make the orders was “because
    I have determined that [the respondent] does not present an ongoing risk
    to the community.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i> that provide for the DNA and sex offender
    registry orders make such orders presumptive unless the court is satisfied
    the person has established that the impact of the orders on the offender’s
    interests would be “grossly disproportionate” to the public interest in the
    protection of society.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Insofar
    as the DNA order is concerned, the respondent concedes, based on the broader
    purposes of the legislation outlined in <i>R. v. Briggs </i>(2001), 157 C.C.C.
    (3d) 38 and <i>R. v. Hendry </i>(2002)<i>, </i>161 C.C.C. (3d)<i> </i>275<i>, </i>that
    the trial judge erred by focusing on the respondent’s risk of re-offending.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Insofar
    as registration in the sex offender registry is concerned, the respondent
    submits that a trial judge must consider is how effective the individual’s
    registration would be in serving the public interest.  The <i>Criminal Code </i>points
    the trial judge to the goal of protection of society through the investigation
    of crimes using information in the registry.  If recidivism is unlikely,
    the respondent submits that registration serves little public purpose and
    the respondent should be granted an exemption.  Accordingly, he submits that,
    having regard to the fact the offender has no prior criminal record, has
    lived his entire life in the Guelph area, has a steady job and good character
    references, the trial judge’s decision is not unreasonable and must be afforded
    deference.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our opinion, the respondent’s submission misconstrues the wording of the
    section requiring registration in the sex offender registry.  Section 490.012(4)
    provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The court is not required to make an order under
    this section if it is satisfied that the person has established that, if
    the order were made, the impact on them, including their privacy or liberty,
    would be grossly disproportionate to the public interest in protecting society
    through the effective investigation of crimes of a sexual nature, to be achieved
    by the registration of information relating to sex offenders under the <i>Sex
    Offender Information Registration Act. </i></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    only circumstance in which the court would not make an order under this section
    is if the impact on the offender’s privacy and liberty interests is grossly
    disproportionate to the public interest.  No evidence was given by the offender
    to the effect that that his privacy and liberty interests would be affected
    more than the normal inconvenience he would incur in complying with the requirements
    of registration.  Accordingly, there was no evidence to displace the public
    interest in registration.  This is not the case, nor is it necessary for
    our purposes, to attempt to define all of the factors that make up the public
    interest. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Because
    the section requires that the effect on the offender must be “grossly disproportionate” to
    the public interest to allow the judge to decline to make the order, the
    public interest in registration is deemed to be significant.  The trial judge
    erred by minimizing the public interest in registration in all the circumstances
    of this case.  More importantly, the trial judge did not undertake the balancing
    exercise he was required to perform.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Insofar
    as the question of whether we ought to make the orders sought or remit the
    matters to the trial judge is concerned, we agree with the appellant that
    the orders should issue.  The Crown sought both orders.  The respondent’s
    counsel made no submissions about either order.  The trial judge erred in
    principle in not making the orders.  There is no reason to remit the matters
    back to the trial judge. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the result, the Crown appeal is allowed, the orders of the trial judge refusing
    to make a DNA databank order and a sex registry order are set aside and the
    orders sought under the <i>Code </i>are substituted.  </p>
