    parties to this appeal are not strangers. In a judgment rendered September
    2, 2005, this court concluded that, pursuant to s. 14(1) of the <i>Canada
    Post Corporation Act</i>, R.S. 1985, c. C-10<i> </i>(“the Act”), Canada Post
    Corporation (“CP”) enjoys an exclusive privilege over “collecting”, “transmitting” and “delivering” mail
    within Canada. See <i>Canada Post Corp. v. Key Mail Canada Inc.</i> (2005),
    259 D.L.R. (4th) 309 at para. 11. The appellant in the present appeal – G3
    Worldwide (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ) Inc. c.o.b. Spring and Spring Canada Spring (“Spring”) – participated in

      alleges that Spring </span>carries on the business of collecting, transmitting
      and delivering international mail, including letters, from senders in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    to overseas locations. CP says that these activities violate the exclusive
    privilege which Parliament has granted to it. <span lang=EN-US>Therefore,
    CP brought an application in which it sought:</span></p>

      such accounting [.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US> </span>It
    is not seriously disputed that the activities in which Spring is engaged,
    and which are the subject of CP’s application,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> violate s. 14(1) of the Act as it has been interpreted
    by this court. However, Spring asserts that CP cannot seek to enforce its
    privilege by way of civil proceedings and that CP has no cause of action.
    Spring therefore brought a motion to quash CP’s Notice of Application. In
    an order dated October 29, 2005, Farley J. dismissed Spring’s motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> CP’s
    application then proceeded for hearing before Morawetz J. where he addressed
    whether CP was entitled to an injunction against Spring. Spring argued that
    the application should be converted into an action and that it was entitled
    to raise the equitable defences of estoppel, laches and delay. These defences,
    if successful, would in effect nullify s. 14(1) and permit Spring to continue
    to carry on its business activities. In an order dated May 24, 2006, Morawetz
    J. dismissed both of Spring’s arguments and granted CP the permanent injunction
    that it sought.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

    a result of these proceedings, there are now two appeals before this court.
    Spring appeals both the decision of the motion judge (“the motion appeal”)
    and that of the application judge (“the application appeal”). Briefly, Spring
    asserts that the motion judge erred in failing to quash CP’s Notice of Application,
    that the application judge erred when he failed to convert CP’s application
    to an action, and that the application judge erred when he determined that
    Spring could not avail itself of equitable defences to CP’s injunction. For
    the reasons that follow, I would not give effect to any of Spring’s grounds
    of appeal.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US> </span>CP
    is a Crown corporation established to provide universal mail service in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    — a lightly populated, but geographically vast country. CP is required to
    provide mail service to all points in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , however remote, at reasonable cost, but in a financially viable way. CP
    charges a uniform rate for its various classes of service. This uniform rate
    has been a tradition of the Canadian postal administration since it began,
    and remains a core component of CP’s system. See <i>Key Mail</i>, <i>supra</i> at
    para. 19.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    many Canadian communities cannot be served economically. Hence, CP needs
    to engage in the lucrative letter mail business and Parliament has granted
    it an exclusive privilege respecting the collection, transmission and delivery
    of letters. As the respondent notes, the exclusive privilege granted to CP
    enables it to provide ordinary mail service throughout the country at the
    uniform rate despite its many geographical challenges. This is because the
    relatively low cost of providing services to the eighty per cent of the population
    that lives largely in dense urban centres within one hundred and fifty kilometres
    of the southern border with the United States offsets the relatively high
    cost of providing such services to the remaining twenty per cent of the population
    that lives throughout the more remote parts of Canada.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Spring
    is ultimately owned by the postal administrations of the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">United Kingdom</st1:country-region>
    , the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Netherlands</st1:country-region>
    , and
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Singapore</st1:country-region>
    . It carries on the business of collecting, transmitting and delivering international
    mail, including letters, from senders in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    to overseas locations. Spring’s operations focus on the largest corporate
    and institutional mailers in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , who reside in the more densely populated and easily serviceable areas of
    the country. Spring does not serve the more remote areas of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    where the costs are high in relation to the revenue generated. Unlike CP,
    Spring is not required to bear the high cost of providing services to the
    more remote regions of
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .</p>

    2003, CP advised Spring that its operations violated s. 14(1) of the Act
    and, if it would not voluntarily restrict its activities, CP would commence
    legal action. Spring refused to curtail its operations and the application
    was started in November, 2004.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the purpose of the application, CP accepted as correct Spring’s assertion
    that CP had been aware of the impugned operations from 1990 (when the operations
    were conducted by Spring’s predecessor, TNT) until TNT’s assets were sold
    to Spring in 2001. During this time, CP took no action against TNT. </p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;'>The Motion Appeal</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the motion to strike CP’s application, the appellant argued that CP has no
    cause of action and that s. 14 of the Act does not permit CP to enforce its
    exclusive privilege by way of civil proceedings.   In saying this, the appellant
    relied heavily on the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>The
    Queen v. Saskatchewan Wheat Pool</i> (1983), 143 D.L.R. (3d) 9 and <i>Board
    of Governors of Seneca College v. Bhadauria </i>(1981), 124 D.L.R. (3d) 193.
    The appellant now repeats these arguments on appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to <i>Saskatchewan Wheat Pool</i>, the appellant submits that the
    Supreme Court made a policy decision to not recognize a tort of statutory
    breach and held instead that proof of a breach of statute can only serve
    as evidence that the standard of care in a negligence action has been breached.
    The respondent takes the position that <i>Saskatchewan Wheat Pool</i> simply
    has no application in this case. <i>Saskatchewan Wheat Pool</i>, it says,
    is about breach of a statutory duty of care and negligence – neither of which
    are relevant here.<a
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a>  After carefully considering <i>Saskatchewan Wheat
    Pool</i>, the motion judge agreed that case was not a bar to CP’s application. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the motion judge’s and the respondent’s positions are correct. The
    issue before the court in <i>Saskatchewan Wheat Pool </i>was stated by Dixon
    J. at pp. 9-10 as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This case raises the difficult issue of the relation
    of a breach of statutory duty to a civil cause of action. Where “A”
    has breached a statutory duty causing injury to “B”, does “B” have a civil
    cause of action against “A”? If so, is “A’s” liability absolute, in the sense
    that it exists independently of fault, or is “A” free from liability if the
    failure to perform the duty is through no fault of his?  In these proceedings
    the Canadian Wheat Board (the Board) is seeking to recover damages from the
    Saskatchewan Wheat Pool (the Pool) for delivery of infested grain out of
    a terminal elevator contrary to s. 86(<i>c</i>) of the <i>Canada Grain Act, </i>1970-71-72
    (Can.), c. 7.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>By contrast, the case before
    this court has nothing to do with a breach of any statutory duty of care.
    It is not a negligence case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to <i>Bhadauria</i>,<i> </i>the appellant argues that the Act provides
    a complete code, which includes remedies for its breach and, in such circumstances,
    no civil action</p>
  <br clear=all>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'> lies to enforce the duties
    and rights created or protected by the Act. In <i>Bhadauria</i>, Chief Justice
    Laskin stated at pp. 194-195:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my opinion, the attempt of the respondent to
    hold the judgment in her favour on the ground that a right of action springs
    directly from a breach of the <i>Ontario Human Rights Code</i> cannot succeed.
    The reason lies in the comprehensiveness of the Code in its administrative
    and adjudicative features, the latter including a wide right of appeal to
    the Courts on both fact and law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that in many ways the Act is similar to the <i>Ontario
    Human Rights Code</i> (“the Code”) and is a complete code within the meaning
    of <i>Bhadauria</i>. It submits that CP cannot bring an action in respect
    of its exclusive privilege because the Act does not expressly contemplate
    such action.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[4]</span></span></span></a> The motion judge rejected this submission; he
    concluded at para. 21 that the <i>Ontario Human Rights Code</i> is “quite
    different in nature and intent than the Act”. As Laskin C.J.C. noted at p.
    198 of <i>Bhadauria</i>,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In addition to the complaint procedure and the
    possibility of a board of inquiry and judicial scrutiny thereafter, the Code …
    provides for summary conviction penalties for contravention of the Code and
    a conviction may be followed by an application to a Judge of the Ontario
    Supreme Court by the Minister for an injunction to restrain the continuance
    of the violation of the Code. However … prosecution depends upon the previous
    consent thereto in writing by the Minister.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The comprehensiveness of the Code is obvious from
    this recital of its substantive and enforcement provisions. There is a possibility

    on prosecution will be sought also depends on action by the Minister. I do

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>counsel for Postpar made an oral
      application for the dismissal for these proceedings, firstly on the ground
      of inordinate delay on the part of Canada Post in having launched them,

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>CP
      brought injunction proceedings against Postpar, seeking to enjoin it from
      violating its exclusive privilege under the Act. As in this appeal, counsel
      for Postpar sought to dismiss CP’s application. Using much the same arguments
      as are advanced by Spring before this court, Postpar argued that injunctive
      relief was not available to CP because the Act contemplates specific penal
      remedies for the infractions alleged and because CP had inordinately delayed

    the appellant also pointed this court to an English decision that considered
    similar issues to those under appeal. In <i>Consignia plc v. Hays plc and

style='font-size:14.0pt;'>(Ch)</span>, Consignia (a private successor in title
    to the Post Office) brought an action claiming damages from Hays for distributing
    mail contrary to Consignia’s exclusive privilege under s. 66 of the <i>British
    Telecommunications Act 1981</i> (1981, c. 38). Section 66(1) of this Act
    provided, “Subject to the following provisions of this Part, the Post Office
    shall have throughout the
    <st1:place

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">United Kingdom</st1:country-region>
    the exclusive privilege of conveying letters from one place to another and
    of performing all the incidental services of receiving, collecting and delivering
    letters”. Jacob J. of the Chancery Division held, however, that s. 66(1)
    did not confer on Consignia a civil cause of action.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, <i>Consignia</i> does not assist the appellant as it can readily
    be distinguished from the appeal before this court. The legislative history
    with respect to the <i>British Telecommunications Act 1981</i> indicates
    that the English Parliament had clearly turned its mind to the question of
    how the exclusive privilege conveyed by the British Act ought to be enforced.
    The same cannot be said of the Canadian Parliament in enacting the <i>Canada
    Post Act</i>.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    although the court in <i>Consignia</i> heard and rejected the argument that
    a civil remedy was necessary to ensure economically viable universal service,
    I do not think that argument was of the same force in <i>Consignia</i> as
    it is in the present case. Not only is the geography of the two countries
    quite different, but the Canadian legislation also specifically requires
    CP to “conduct its operations on a self-sustaining financial basis while
    providing a standard of service that will meet the needs of the people in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ”. The British Act has no equivalent provision. The closest it comes is s.
    59(2), which only provides that in exercising its powers, the Post Office
    shall have regard to “efficiency and economy” and “the social, industrial
    and commercial needs of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">United Kingdom</st1:country-region>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In the result, I would dismiss
      the motion of Spring as I have concluded that the <i>Act</i> does not preclude

      public policy character, complying with the legislation cannot be extinguished

      way, as articulated by the application judge at para. 24 of his judgment: </span></p>

      against the Crown when an exercise of non-statutory discretion is involved.
      When interpreting a statute or acting pursuant to a legislative provision,
      all the authorities agree that estoppel cannot lie against the Crown[.]  </span></p>

    note that CP also argues that, in addition to basing its application on the
    fact that Spring’s activities violate s. 14(1) of the Act, it can rely on
    the tort of interference with economic interests for the relief sought in
    its Notice of Application.  Without question, CP’s Notice of Application
    seeks only a declaration that Spring’s activities violate s. 14(1) of the
    Act, an injunction to restrain those activities, and an accounting.  While
    Spring’s conduct may support a common law tort claim for interference with
    economic interests, no such claim was pleaded.  To make this claim would
    require an amendment to the Notice of Application.  Therefore, the sole issue
    before this court is whether the infringement of s. 14(1) gives rise to a
    cause of action.</p>
