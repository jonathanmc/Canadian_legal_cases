'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Following
    a trial by judge and jury, the appellant was convicted of two counts of attempted
    murder and two counts of robbery. He was sentenced to seven years imprisonment,
    after being credited with the equivalent of three years for pre-trial custody. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      He
    appeals both his convictions and his sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      He
    raises four arguments on his conviction appeal. He says that the trial judge
    should not have admitted the statements he made to the police following his
    arrest that were recorded on video and audiotape because the trial judge
    erred in finding them to be voluntary. Second, he says that these statements
    were taken in violation of his rights under s. 10(b) of the <i>Canadian Charter
    of Rights and Freedoms</i>. Third, he argues that the trial judge erred in
    his charge on party liability. Lastly, he says that the charge was not even-handed,
    contained speculation and was misleading in several respects.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      He
    also appeals his sentence and argues that the trial judge misapprehended
    the jury’s conclusion about his role, and imposed an excessive sentence as
    a result.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      For
    the reasons that follow, I conclude that there must be a new trial because
    his statements were taken in violation of his s. 10(b) rights and should
    not have been admitted into evidence. It is therefore unnecessary to deal
    with the other issues raised on the conviction appeal, or with sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    events giving rise to these charges took place on November 23, 2002. The
    complainants, two young men who were best friends, were viciously attacked
    outside the Victoria Park subway station at approximately 1:30 a.m. by three
    young men they did not know. Both were stabbed and as a result suffered very
    serious injuries. Both were also robbed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Two
    of the three attackers were identified by photo line-up. The third remains
    at large. One of the two identified was a young offender who was arrested
    on November 30, 2002, and pleaded guilty to robbery.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    other was the appellant. He was arrested by Detective Love on December 27,
    2002 at 2:45 p.m. as he was leaving his apartment. He was advised of his
    right to counsel and immediately told Detective Love that he wanted to talk
    to his lawyer. Detective Love said that he could do so when they got to the
    police station. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant was then taken to the police station and was again advised of his
    right to speak to a lawyer. Although he did not reiterate his request to
    consult counsel, neither was he provided with the opportunity to do so in
    response to his earlier request. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    3:37 p.m., the appellant was placed in an interview room and searched. While
    the appellant and the police officers involved gave conflicting accounts
    of what transpired after that, the following was generally uncontested.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
    4:05 p.m. to approximately 4:25 p.m., Detective Love and Detective Cowan,
    the lead investigator, were with him in the interview room, and Detective
    Cowan questioned him. There was no recording of any kind made of this interview.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this interview, the appellant initially denied being present at the Victoria
    Park subway station, but then admitted to being involved in a fight there,
    although not one involving weapons. He also agreed to a photo line-up to
    identify the outstanding suspect, and to be recorded on video while doing
    so. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant then repeated his request to talk to a lawyer and at that point
    was given that opportunity. After speaking with duty counsel, the appellant
    participated in a videoed photo line-up in which he unsuccessfully attempted
    to identify the third attacker, and then made a statement to the police that
    was audiotaped. In this statement, the appellant again placed himself at
    the scene and admitted to punching one victim. Both statements were concluded
    by 7:21 p.m.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the Crown sought to introduce both the video and the audiotaped statements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    police evidence made clear that there was videotaping equipment readily available
    at the police station, that they conducted themselves throughout in the hope
    that the appellant would give a statement, and that their notes of what transpired
    without being recorded were not very good and of little assistance.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE SECTION 10(b) ISSUE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section
      10(b) of the <i>Charter</i> reads as follows:  </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Everyone has the right on arrest

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>…</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant argues that the two recorded statements were taken in violation
      of his s. 10(b) rights because they were part of the police interview process
      that started at 4:05 p.m. That process began after the appellant had asked
      to speak to a lawyer but before he was given a reasonable opportunity to
      do so. The appellant says that in the circumstances the statements were
      made in violation of his s. 10(b) rights, and were not properly admissible
      pursuant to s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant did not raise this argument at trial. In ruling the recorded
      statements to be admissible, the trial judge said this:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I am conscious that this is not
      a Charter application, but Crown counsel conceded that this wrongful refusal
      of Detective Cowan’s to hold off questioning in the face of the request
      for counsel is a factor I can consider in determining voluntariness.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      respondent now argues that the appellant should not be permitted to raise
      the <i>Charter</i> issue at this stage. It says that the Crown might have
      sought to elicit further evidence had it been raised at trial, and in any
      event, there is an insufficient evidentiary basis for this court to determine
      the issue.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There
      is no doubt that the clear general rule is that <i>Charter</i> issues ought
      not to be raised for the first time on appeal. There is good reason for
      this. There is possible prejudice to the adversely affected litigant who
      is unable to call the evidence it would have wished on the issue. As well,
      there may be an absence of a sufficient record for the appellate court
      to properly determine the matter. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However,
      the rule is not absolute. In <i>R. v. Mayo</i> (1999), 133 C.C.C. (3d)
      168, this court exercised its discretion to permit a <i>Charter</i> issue
      to be raised for the first time, citing <i>R. v. Brown</i> (1993), 83 C.C.C.
      (3d) 129 (S.C.C.). In <i>Brown</i>, the majority of the Supreme Court of
      Canada agreed with the dissent of Harradence J.A. in the Alberta Court
      of Appeal, reported at (1992), 73 C.C.C. (3d) 481. At p. 488, Harradence
      J.A. put it this way:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Where the court has a sufficient
      factual foundation to appraise the issue without prejudice to the parties
      and particularly where <i>refusing</i> to do so will result in unfairness,
      then in my view it is proper for the appeal court to hear and determine
      the question put before it. [Emphasis in original.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      this case, there is a very full evidentiary record of the entire interaction
      between the police and the appellant, from his arrest to the conclusion
      of the second recorded statement. This includes the uncontested fact that
      the appellant expressed his wish to speak to a lawyer immediately upon
      his arrest, but was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to do so until
      after being questioned by the police between 4:05 p.m. and 4:25 p.m. During
      that interview, he admitted that he had been at the scene of the crime
      and had been involved in a fight. In my view, there is a sufficient record
      for this court to properly determine the issue.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Crown also argues that if the issue had been raised at trial, it could
      have tailored its evidence accordingly in two respects.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It
      says that it might have called an additional police witness to testify
      about Detective Love’s initial dealing with the appellant. However, that
      episode was fully testified to by both Detective Love and the appellant,
      and there is no suggestion that the additional witness would add anything
      of substance. Moreover, the critical fact, namely that the appellant’s
      request to consult a lawyer went unfulfilled until after his first interrogation,
      is not in dispute.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Crown also says that if this issue had been raised at trial it might have
      been able to make a live issue out of whether the appellant was diligent
      in asserting his right to counsel. However, there is no suggestion of any
      evidence that might have been called in this connection. Moreover, there
      is a full record of the entire interaction between the appellant and the
      police post-arrest, and there is nothing preventing the Crown from arguing
      this point on that record.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Crown did not argue that the record suggested any tactical advantage to
      the defence in not raising the <i>Charter</i> issue at trial. Nor can I
      think of one.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally,
      this court heard full argument on the <i>Charter</i> issue.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To
      summarize, this court has a sufficient evidentiary record to decide the <i>Charter</i> issue
      at first instance. The Crown does not appear to have been prejudicially
      denied the right to call evidence on the issue. There was no tactical advantage
      to the appellant in not raising it at trial. The issue was fully argued
      before us. And, it would result in an unfairness if the appellant were
      denied any adjudication of what would appear to be a serious <i>Charter</i> issue.
      It is therefore appropriate that this court address it.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Turning
      then to the merits of the <i>Charter</i> issue, there can be no doubt that
      the inculpatory statements made by the appellant to the police between
      4:05 p.m. and 4:25 p.m. were taken in violation of his s. 10(b) rights.
      He had already expressed his wish to exercise his right to consult a lawyer
      but had not been given an opportunity to do so. Once he made this request
      the police were obliged to refrain from eliciting incriminating evidence
      from him until he was afforded that opportunity. See <i>R. v. Prosper</i> (1994),
      92 C.C.C. (3d) 353 at 375 (S.C.C.).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Crown relies on the fact that the two statements admitted into evidence,
      the video statement and the audio recording, were given after the appellant
      subsequently spoke to counsel.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      my view, this does not immunize them from the earlier <i>Charter</i> breach.
      In circumstances such as this, the analysis is that described by Doherty
      J.A. in <i>R. v. Plaha </i>(2004), 188 C.C.C. (3d) 289 at para. 45 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The evidence will be “obtained
      in a manner” that infringed a <i>Charter</i> right if on a review of the
      entire course of events, the breach and the obtaining of the evidence can
      be said to be part of the same transaction or course of conduct. The connection
      between the breach and the obtaining of the evidence may be temporal, contextual,
      causal or a combination of the three. The connection must be more than
      tenuous. [Citation omitted.]</span></p>

      s. 10(b) rights, and the taking of the two recorded statements that were
      concluded less than three hours later. Moreover, the three statements were
      all part of the same interrogation process. The appellant remained in the
      custody of the same police officers during that time and their objective
      throughout was to obtain statements from the appellant. The inculpatory
      audio recording is essentially a repeat of the first statement made by
      the appellant prior to obtaining legal advice. The police made no attempt
      to sever any connection between these two. As Doherty J.A. put it in <i>Plaha</i>,
      at para. 53,
    “[t]he  absence of any attempt by the police to make a ‘fresh start’ after
    the appellant had spoken with counsel further cements  the connection” between
    the statements.</span></p>

      would therefore conclude that the video statement and the audio recording
      were obtained in a manner that infringed the appellant’s right to counsel. </span></p>

      would also conclude that these statements should not be admitted pursuant
      to s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>. They were conscriptive evidence. The
      police questioning of the appellant from 4:05 p.m. to 4:25 p.m., while
      he was in their custody at the police station after having unsuccessfully
      sought the opportunity to talk to a lawyer, was a serious breach of his
      s. 10(b) rights. There is nothing to suggest that the appellant would have
      provided the same conscriptive evidence had he been accorded his constitutional
      rights. The appellant’s conduct during the two recorded statements does
      not admit of any such inference. As Doherty J.A. said in <i>Plaha</i>,
      at para. 61, in addressing the same question, the appellant had “committed
      himself to a certain position with the police” between 4:05&nbsp;p.m. and
      4:25 p.m. without having been given his right to counsel. No advice that
      counsel could have given him after that could change that reality.</span></p>

      summarize, the admitted statements were conscriptive. The breach of the
      appellant’s s. 10(b) rights was serious. The admission of the statements
      would undermine the fairness of the trial, and would bring the administration
      of justice into disrepute. They should not have been admitted. </span></p>

      trial.</span></p>
