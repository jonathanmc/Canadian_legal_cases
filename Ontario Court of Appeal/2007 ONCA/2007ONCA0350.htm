  <h4>Background</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    April 2, 1995, Debbie Rizzi injured her right leg when she attempted to move
    some metal sheets that were stored in the laundry/storage room of the apartment
    building in which she lived.  The apartment building is owned by the respondents.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms.
    Rizzi later developed fibromyalgia.  In an action brought against the respondents
    (the moving parties on this motion), Ms. Rizzi claimed damages for the injury
    to her leg and for fibromyalgia.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Causation
    in respect of the fibromyalgia was a central issue at trial.  The parties
    offered competing theories.  Ms. Rizzi’s theory was that the leg injury caused
    or materially contributed to the development of fibromyalgia and that she
    was entitled to full compensation for that condition.  The respondents argued
    that Ms. Rizzi’s pain complaints were caused by a pre&#8209;existing condition
    which started in her right wrist and, over a period of months just prior
    to the incident on April 2, 1995, increased in severity and extended up her
    arm and into her shoulder.  It was this pain, the respondents contended,
    that continued to spread and led to the diffuse pain that Ms. Rizzi suffered.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Expert
    evidence at the trial differed with respect to the cause of the fibromyalgia
    or diffuse pain.  Some experts testified that the leg injury caused or contributed
    to the development of the fibromyalgia or diffuse pain.  One defence expert
    testified that the appellant’s pain complaints were more likely caused by
    the pre&#8209;existing condition than the leg injury.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    at trial disagreed about the test for causation.  Counsel for the respondents
    urged that the instruction to the jury be based on the “but for” test.  In
    the charge, however, the trial judge proposed a number of possible scenarios
    and then instructed the jury on the basis of the
    “material contribution” test.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    jury found in favour of the appellant, including that her fibromyalgia or
    diffuse pain was caused or materially contributed to by the incident on April
    2, 1995.  They assessed general non-pecuniary damages of $41,000, special
    damages of $17,400, past income loss of $175,000, future income loss of $485,500
    and future care costs of $160,000.  The jury found Ms. Rizzi to be 75% contributorily
    negligent for the accident.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    a Notice of Appeal dated December 29, 2005, Ms. Rizzi appealed the quantum

    Supreme Court of Canada clarified the law of causation in <i>Resurfice Corp.
    v. Hanke</i>, [2007] S.C.J. No. 7, 2007 SCC 7, released February 8, 2007.  In <i>Resurfice</i>,
    the trial judge applied the “but for” test in determining causation but the
    Alberta Court of Appeal, relying on <i>Athey v. Leonati</i>, [1996] 3 S.C.R.
    458, thought the “but for” test was unworkable and applied, instead, the “material
    contribution” test.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Supreme Court of Canada reversed the appeal decision and restored that of
    the trial judge.  It reiterated that the basic test for determining causation
    is the “but for” test and that the test applies to multi&#8209;cause injuries.  The
    Court stated that the “material contribution” test applies only in special
    circumstances.  Special circumstances involve two requirements:  first, it
    must be impossible for the plaintiff to prove that the defendant’s negligence
    caused the plaintiff’s injury using the “but for” test and, second, it must
    be clear that the defendant breached a duty of care owed to the plaintiff
    thereby exposing the plaintiff to an unreasonable risk of injury and the
    plaintiff must have suffered that form of injury.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Barker
      v. Montfort Hospital</i>, [2007] O.J. No. 1417 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), released on April 18, 2007, this court relied on <i>Resurfice </i>and
    allowed an appeal from a trial decision in which the “material contribution”
    test had been applied.  This court noted that the first special circumstance
    requirement of impossibility had not been established and, therefore, causation
    ought to have been decided on the “but for” test.      </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    reviewing the above decisions, counsel for the respondents immediately sought
    and received instructions to cross&#8209;appeal on the issue of causation.  A
    Notice of Cross&#8209;Appeal was served on the appellant’s solicitors on
    April 23, 2007.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondents now seek leave for an extension of time to cross-appeal on the
    grounds that the trial judge erred in his instruction to the jury with respect
    to the law of causation.  The appellant opposes the motion on three bases:
    (1) the recent decisions have not changed the law; (2) the trial judge correctly
    instructed on the issue of causation so there is no merit to the appeal;
    and (3) Ms. Rizzi would be prejudiced in a number of ways, including that
    she would be unable to repay monies already paid to her; permitting the cross-appeal
    to proceed could lead to the need for an adjournment and, thus, a delay in
    the hearing of the appeal; and, success on the cross-appeal increases the
    likelihood that a new trial will be ordered.  </p>

    this motion involves a request for leave to file a cross-appeal, in my view,
    it is useful to consider the factors that apply when determining whether

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>While appellate courts have considered a number

  <h4>Analysis  </h4>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>Intention to Cross-Appeal
      and Delay</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondents concede that they did not form an intention to appeal within
    the prescribed time period.  They explain the approximately fifteen months
    of delay on the basis that, prior to <i>Resurfice</i>, conflicting appellate
    authority on causation made success on appeal very uncertain. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    accept the explanation for the delay.  Although <i>Resurfice </i>did not
    change the law of causation, it did clarify the law.  The history of <i>Resurfice </i>demonstrates
    that there was confusion in this area following <i>Athey v. Leonati</i> – the
    trial judge applied the “but for” test but the Alberta Court of Appeal applied
    the “material contribution” test.  If there were no confusion about the law
    of causation, it seems to me that the two levels of court would not have
    differed on which test applied.  This court’s decision in <i>Barker </i>reinforces
    my view.     </p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>Prejudice</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    will address the three types of prejudice it is argued will ensue if the
    motion is granted:  delay, exposure to a monetary loss and the possibility
    of a new trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    am not persuaded that the proposed cross-appeal will cause a significant
    delay in the hearing of the appeal.  The addition of the causation issue
    will not create the need for additional transcripts to be ordered.  The existing
    and available material adequately supports the arguments of both parties
    on causation.  Counsel for the appellant advises that he is very busy between
    now and the scheduled appeal date of July 16, 2007.  Nonetheless, in my view,
    there is adequate time for the parties to file their materials on the cross-appeal
    so that the appeal could proceed as scheduled.  If an adjournment is necessary,
    little delay should be occasioned as counsel for the respondent has advised
    that he would move expeditiously to perfect the cross-appeal.          </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    terms of monetary prejudice, it appears that this type of prejudice “cuts
    both ways”.  While the appellant faces the prospect of a reduced damage award
    and a possible obligation to repay sums already received if the cross-appeal
    is successful, the respondents also face exposure for increased amounts should
    the appeal be successful.     </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    for the possibility of a new trial, the appellant says it is her fervent
    wish that the appeal will resolve the matter.  However, it is clear that
    a new trial may be necessary as a result of the appeal alone.  Indeed, the
    Notice of Appeal requests that as an alternate form of relief.  Although
    the cross-appeal may increase the prospect of a new trial being ordered,
    that prospect already exists as a result of the appellant’s decision to appeal.   </p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>Merit of the Cross-Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the cross-appeal has considerable merit.  I do not accept the appellant’s
    contention that the trial judge correctly instructed on the issue of causation.  Instruction
    was given on the basis of
    “material contribution” and the jury findings were on that basis also.  But,
    the necessary determination that special circumstances warranted application
    of the “material contribution” test had not been made.  Until such a determination
    is made, it cannot be known which of the two causation tests ought to have
    been applied.      </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ultimately,
    however, it is fairness considerations that move me to grant the motion.  Had
    the motion been for an extension of time to file an appeal, the result might
    have been different.  In such a situation, the public interest in the finality
    of judgments may be paramount.  But, this motion is not for an extension
    of time to file a notice of appeal; it is a motion to permit the filing of
    a notice of cross-appeal.  Finality considerations do not come into play
    because this case has not been finally resolved; the appeal has yet to be
    heard. </p>

    the respondents face significant exposure should the appeal be successful.  In
    the circumstances, they are entitled to have their concerns about the correctness
    of the judgment below addressed at the same time as the appellant’s concerns
    about the correctness of the judgment are addressed.  And, the panel hearing
    the appeal ought to be in a position to properly decide the appeal and ensure
    that a just result is arrived at.  Addressing the concerns of only one side
    precludes such a result.  </p>

    light of the merit of the cross-appeal, the competing considerations in respect
    of prejudice and these fairness concerns, the justice of the case compels
    me to grant the extension.  </p>

    I would grant the motion and permit the respondents an extension of time
    to file a Notice of Cross&#8209;Appeal, such notice to be filed with seven
    days of the date of the release of these reasons.  Although successful on
    the motion, as the respondents sought an indulgence of the court which was
    reasonably opposed by the appellant, I order costs to the appellant fixed
    at $4,000, all inclusive.</p>
