    the decision of the Minister of Justice refusing to rescind an earlier order by
    the former Minister of Justice that he be surrendered to Germany to face trial

  <h4>Background</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant, a Canadian and German citizen, was arrested in Canada on August
    31, 1999 on a provisional warrant of arrest in respect of a request for extradition
    by Germany.  Bail was granted several days later.  Motions, evidence, and
    submissions were made to the extradition judge over the course of the next
    five years.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On May 27, 2004, the applicant was committed for extradition
    on all but one of the offences listed in the Authority to Proceed.  The formal order was signed on June 3,
    2004.  On that same day, a notice of
    appeal was filed in this court and the applicant applied for bail pending
    appeal which was granted.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Between July 15, 2004 and October 20, 2004, submissions were
    made to the Minister of Justice regarding his surrender decision.  The Minister rejected those submissions on
    October 31, 2004 and ordered the applicant’s surrender.  A notice of application for judicial review
    was filed with this court on November 29, 2004.  On March 1, 2006, this court dismissed the appeal and the
    judicial review.  A notice of
    application was made to the Supreme Court of Canada which was dismissed on
    February 1, 2007.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On May 17, 2006 and August 10, 2006, the applicant wrote to
    the Minister of Justice urging the Minister to reconsider and rescind the
    earlier surrender decision because of press reports of comments made by the
    Chief Prosecutor and the judicial spokesperson for the court in Augsburg,
    Germany about the case.  On December 14,
    2006, the Minister refused to rescind the earlier surrender decision.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On December 18, 2006, an application for judicial review of
    the Minister’s decision was filed with this court.  On February 8, 2007, the applicant was granted release pending
    the determination of this judicial review of the Minister’s decision.</p>
  <h4>Analysis</h4>
  <h3><span style='font-weight:normal'>a)         Fresh
    evidence application</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the outset of the hearing, the applicant brought a fresh
    evidence application consisting of two documents.  The first is a letter from Justus Demmer, the head of media and
    communications of the press agency that filed the press reports at issue in
    this application.  It confirms that the
    reporter who wrote the article observed the common journalistic standards.  The second is an affidavit of Eberhard
    Kempf, a respected member of the criminal bar of Frankfurt.  It describes the guidelines that apply to
    judicial spokespersons and opines on the inappropriate nature of the comments
    reported as having been made by the judicial spokesperson.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, it is in the interests of justice that the court
    receive and consider the fresh evidence on this application.  </p>
  <h3><span style='font-weight:normal;'>b)            Applicable standard</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both counsel agree that when s. 7 of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms </i>is the basis of a challenge
    to the Minister’s decision to surrender, the applicant must establish on a
    balance of probabilities that the decision in question violates his <i>Charter </i>rights in that his surrender
    would be “simply unacceptable” or “sufficiently shocks the conscience” of
    Canadians: <i>Pacificador v. Canada
    (Minister of Justice)</i> (2002), 166 C.C.C. (3d) 321 at para. 44 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As stated by McLachlin J. in <i>Kindler v. Canada (Minister of Justice)</i> (1991) 67 C.C.C. (3d) 1
    (S.C.C.) at paras. 67-69:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left'>The test for whether an extradition law or action offends s. 7 of the
    Charter on account of the penalty which may be imposed in the requesting state,
    is whether the imposition of the penalty by the foreign state “sufficiently
    shocks” the Canadian conscience: Schmidt, per La Forest J. at p. 214.  The fugitive must establish that he or she
    faces “a situation that is simply unacceptable”: Allard, supra, at p. 508.  Thus, the reviewing court must consider the
    offence for which the penalty may be prescribed, <u>as well as the nature of
    the justice system in the requesting jurisdiction and the safeguards and
    guarantees it affords the fugitive.  Other considerations such as comity and security within Canada may also
    be relevant to the decision to extradite and if so, on what conditions.  At the end of the day the question is
    whether the provision or action in question offends the Canadian sense of what
    is fair, right and just, bearing in mind the nature of the offence and the
    penalty, the foreign justice system and considerations of comity and security,
    and according due latitude to the Minister to balance the conflicting
    considerations.</u> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <h3><span style='font-weight:normal'>c)            Concerns raised by the comments of
    the senior prosecutor and the judge spokesperson for the Regional Court of
    Augsburg</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant points to comments in the German media
    attributed to a senior prosecutor and to the judge who is the spokesperson for
    the Regional Court of Augsburg, the region in which the applicant is to be
    tried.  He says these comments show that
    he will not get a fair trial in Germany because the case against him has been
    prejudged.  Consequently, he argues that
    surrendering him to undergo trial in Germany would violate his right to
    fundamental justice guaranteed by s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the applicant that if the press reports
    accurately quoted the judicial spokesperson and these quotes are not taken out
    of context they are of concern.  However, assuming that the quotes are accurate and not taken out of
    context, I do not accept the applicant’s submission that they show that the
    applicant will not receive a fair trial. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Canada has an extradition treaty with Germany which, as stated
    by La&nbsp;Forest J. in <i>Schmidt v. The
    Queen</i> (1987), 33 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at 215 (S.C.C.), means that, when
    determining whether the surrender of a fugitive offends the basic demands of
    justice: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left'>[T]he courts must begin with the notion that the executive must first
    have determined that the general system for the administration of justice in
    the foreign country sufficiently corresponds to our concepts of justice to
    warrant entering into the treaty in the first place, and must have recognized
    that it too has a duty to ensure that its actions comply with constitutional
    standards.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>In addition, while there
    should not be blind judicial deference, “the courts must be extremely
    circumspect so as to avoid interfering unduly in decisions that involve the
    good faith and honour of this country in its relations with other states.  In a word, judicial intervention must be
    limited to cases of real substance.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, as appears from the Minister’s decision, the comments
    led him to ask his officials to follow up with German authorities.  From these inquires, it is apparent that the
    prosecutor whose comments are at issue, will not be involved in prosecuting
    against the applicant.  The judicial
    spokesperson, whose comments are impugned, will not be on the panel of three
    judges who tries the applicant’s case in Germany.  In Germany, the applicant’s right to be presumed innocent until
    proven guilty and his right to a fair trial are guaranteed by the German
    constitution.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not, therefore, regard the reported comments as providing
    a basis for a reasonable belief that the applicant will not be accorded his
    rights to fairness and due process in the German trial.</p>
  <h3><span style='font-weight:normal;'>d)         The Minister’s decision</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant further submits that given the comments made and
    the obvious political undertones of this case fairness demands that the
    Minister not accept general assurances concerning the fairness of the German
    legal system and that he fully investigate the concern that this particular
    applicant receive a fair trial in Germany.  The applicant submits that the present case is similar in nature to <i>United States of America v. Cobb</i> (2001),
    152 C.C.C. (3d) 270 (S.C.C.).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant argues that the responses received by the
    Minister to his inquiries were not full and frank.  The applicant points to the fresh evidence which states that the
    reported comments of the judicial spokesperson represent a remarkable violation
    of the recognized standards applicable to such spokespersons.  The fresh evidence also postulates that the
    factual information about the case that the spokesperson may have used as a
    basis for his comments would logically have come from the chamber of the judges
    who are responsible for the trial of the applicant’s case in Germany.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant maintains that this fresh evidence demonstrates
    that the Minister’s understanding of the role of a judicial spokesperson under
    the German system and of the appropriateness of the reported comments was wrong
    and that this misunderstanding has tainted his decision.  The applicant submits that the Minister’s
    misunderstanding is apparent from the comment contained in his December 14,
    2006 letter that “in the German system, it must be that there is no necessary
    conflict between a judicial spokesperson commenting on a prosecution and the
    state’s ability to guarantee a fair trial.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is not clear to me that the statement should be interpreted
    as suggested by the applicant.  However,
    in light of the fresh evidence, I agree that, at the time of writing his
    letter, the Minister may not have appreciated that the reported comments of the
    judicial spokesperson could be seen by German criminal lawyers as being
    significantly at variance with appropriate conduct.  That said, however, the Minister correctly noted that the
    reported comments cannot be understood as an attempt to interfere with the exercise
    by the applicant of his rights within the Canadian extradition process as was
    found to be the case in <i>R. v. Cobb</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, I do not understand the Minister to have based his
    decision on whether the comments were or were not appropriate.  The Minister’s decision was based on his
    conclusion that the German courts could be trusted to deal with issues such as
    the apprehension of prejudgment and the potential prejudice that these comments
    may have caused.  This is apparent from
    the sentence in the Minister’s letter that followed the sentence that concerned
    the applicant and which is quoted above.  The Minister went on to state as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>In
    my view, even if it could be concluded that Judge Haeusler’s comments could
    potentially give rise to prejudice for Mr. Schreiber, this is a matter where
    the German court, should be trusted to deal with the issue and fashion a
    remedy, if necessary.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a sense, the fresh evidence supports the Minister’s
    conclusion.  Mr. Kempf refers to
    decisions made by German courts, including the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf,
    to the effect that any comments by prosecutors and spokespersons of a court
    should be objective and restricted to what is absolutely necessary to inform
    the public.  According to Mr. Kempf, the
    German courts he refers to have underlined the importance of fairness and
    respect for the presumption of the innocence of the accused.  In my view, this serves to confirm the
    Minister’s conclusion that there is no systemic problem in Germany that would
    operate to prevent the applicant from receiving due process and a fair
    trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances of this case, I consider that it is for
    the German’s courts to deal with the applicant’s apprehension of prejudgment
    and to fashion the appropriate remedy, if one is warranted. </p>
  <h4>Disposition</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am satisfied that the Minister did not err in his
    interpretation and application of s.&nbsp;7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  The extradition of
    the applicant will not offend the Canadian sense of what is fair, right, and
    just bearing in mind the factors set out in <i>Kindler</i>.  For these reasons I would dismiss the
    application.</p>
