  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant and others, including Ms. Baksh, were separately charged with large-scale
    mortgage fraud. The appellant has already had his preliminary hearing and
    has been bound over for trial in September, 2007. He has been subpoenaed
    to testify at the preliminary inquiry into similar fraud charges against
    Ms. Baksh, scheduled to begin on May 14, 2007. He moved before O’Connor J.
    to quash the subpoena on the grounds that there was no evidence to show that
    the appellant had any material evidence to give and, because the Baksh preliminary
    inquiry will take place before his trial, he would suffer prejudice by being
    forced to testify and give up his right to silence. Essentially, the appellant’s
    position was that the Crown was actually seeking evidence to be used against
    him in his own trial, not evidence relevant to Ms. Baksh.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      O’Connor
    J. refused to quash the subpoena. For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss
    the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Section
    698(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Where a person
    is likely to give material evidence in a proceeding to which this Act applies,
    a subpoena may be issued in accordance with this part requiring that person
    to attend to give evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant has not given any statement to the police. The Crown attorney who
    issued the subpoena acknowledged to appellant’s counsel that he did not know
    what the appellant would say as a witness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    basis for the Crown’s belief that the appellant has material information
    regarding Ms. Baksh’s activities is essentially that when he was arrested,
    he was found with documents that are alleged to be related to some of the
    fraudulent mortgages, and in particular, to addresses that are also linked
    to transactions by Ms. Baksh’s corporation. At his preliminary hearing, the
    appellant’s position was that although the briefcase containing those documents
    belonged to him, he had lent it to Mr. Beg, a man he knows, who pled guilty
    to similar fraud charges. Counsel submitted on the motion that the appellant’s
    position is that he has no information regarding Ms. Baksh and the Crown
    is on a fishing expedition for information about his own defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the motion before O’Connor J., the appellant argued 1) that the Crown had
    not demonstrated that he had material information about Ms. Baksh and, 2)
    that if he were forced to testify at her preliminary inquiry, he would be
    asked to divulge his defence and information that the Crown could use against
    him in his own trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge rejected both arguments. He found that the appellant’s fair
    trial rights were fully protected by s. 5(2) of the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. C-25 and s. 13 of the <i>Charter</i> <i>of Rights and Freedoms</i>,
    against the use of anything he says or any evidence derived from it, as well
    as from its use in cross-examination if he were to testify at his trial and
    contradict what he says at the Baksh preliminary inquiry. See <i>R. v. Henry</i>,
    [2005] 3 S.C.R. 609. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge acknowledged that there is a clear relationship between the
    evidence the Crown seeks and the case against the appellant, and that the
    appellant’s concern about disclosure of his defence has some merit. He concluded,
    however, that the appellant is protected from derivative use and the public
    interest in prosecuting serious criminal offences overrides the relatively
    minor possible prejudice the appellant could suffer. The motion judge made
    the specific finding that the only prejudice the appellant could face as
    a result of testifying would be the subsequent derivative use of his testimony
    at his trial. Because the appellant will be protected from such use, he is
    fully protected: see <i>British Columbia Securities Commission  v. Branch</i>,  [1995]
    2 S.C.R. 3 at para. 9.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the issue of materiality, the motion judge found that the evidence the appellant
    could give is potentially important to the prosecution because he was allegedly
    involved in the same offence as Ms. Baksh and is therefore in a position
    to shed light on her involvement. The fact that Mr. Beg is also available
    to the Crown does not mean that the appellant’s potential evidence is redundant
    or unimportant. At worst it will be confirmatory of Mr.&nbsp;Beg’s evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s main argument on the appeal concerns the issue of materiality.
    In the course of his reasons, the motion judge said the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I disagree as
    to the significance of the prejudice he faces. The Crown’s predominant purpose
    in calling him is to obtain evidence in the prosecution of Ms. Baksh, not
    to obtain evidence to incriminate him. Although the Crown is unable to specify
    exactly what evidence he hopes to extract from the applicant and to a certain
    extent can be said to be on a fishing expedition, this is to be expected
    when calling a person accused of the identical offence to that being prosecuted.
    The fishing expedition in any event is for evidence against Baksh, not the
    applicant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant says that the motion judge erred by not quashing the subpoena after
    he stated that the Crown was on a fishing expedition for evidence relevant
    to Ms. Baksh.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, although this reference taken out of context could be fatal to the
    subpoena, when it is viewed in the context of the reasons as a whole, as
    well as the colloquy with counsel, it is clear that the motion judge was
    satisfied based on the record before the court, that the Crown had a basis
    to expect that the appellant has material evidence on the involvement of
    Ms. Baksh in the fraudulent mortgage scheme. That basis is the appellant’s
    connection with Ontario Wide Finance and that company’s documents found in
    his car and briefcase relating to fraudulent mortgage transactions for which
    Ms.&nbsp;Baksh’s company did the legal work. Obviously, without a statement,
    the Crown does not know exactly what the appellant will say. However, in
    my view, the motion judge was entitled to conclude that Mr. Cunsolo has material
    information relating to the charges against Ms. Baksh.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    also see no error in the motion judge’s conclusion, based on the case law
    from the Supreme Court of Canada, that because the appellant is fully protected
    against any use of his testimony by the Crown at his own trial, the small
    prejudice of disclosing his defence is not sufficient to set aside the subpoena.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
