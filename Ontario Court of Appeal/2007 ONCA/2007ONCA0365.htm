  <h2>Background</h2>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><b>  </b>The
    appellant characterized her relationship with Bailey as emotionally and physically
    abusive.  She testified to numerous abusive interactions: punches to the
    face, a punch to her abdomen when she was pregnant, verbal threats, and derogatory
    comments.  The appellant also alleges that Bailey threatened to take their
    two daughters away from her. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    ten years of marriage, in April 1992, the appellant moved into a women’s
    shelter for four months.  She indicated she was very afraid of Bailey.  On
    May 19, 1992 the appellant was granted interim custody of the children.  Bailey
    was granted periodic access.  The appellant and Bailey executed a separation
    agreement in 1995, which provided that the appellant would give Bailey sixty
    days notice of any intention to remove the children any distance from their
    home.  The agreement provided any dispute about such a proposed move would
    be determined by the courts. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant remarried in 1998 and made plans with her new husband to move to
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Prince Edward Island in August 2001.  She testified she gave notice to Bailey
    of her plans to move the children by giving him a note delivered by their
    daughter.  Bailey obtained and served the appellant with an <i>ex parte</i> order
    prohibiting her from removing the children from
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  Despite the order, and her knowledge of its contents, and despite
    being told she would be in contempt of court, the appellant moved the girls
    to
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Prince Edward Island.  Bailey never followed up legally because his lawyer
    told him it would be fruitless to do so, given the ages of the girls.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Bailey
    saw the girls at Thanksgiving, Christmas and March break.  A disagreement
    arose over whether one of the daughters could attend a private school in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario, for which the deceased’s father had agreed to pay tuition for all
    his grandchildren.  The appellant saw this as a ploy of Bailey’s to “steal” the
    daughter away from her. She grounded the girl and wrote the school forbidding
    it from registering her daughter.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the summer of 2002, the girls came to stay with Bailey for the summer.  During
    the summer, Bailey’s lawyer wrote the appellant asking for her consent to
    give custody of the daughter to Bailey so that she could attend the school.  The
    appellant did not reply.  The girl remained steadfast in her decision.  The
    appellant emailed her expressing a contrary view.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fearing
    her daughter would attend the private school, the appellant drove to
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario on August 18 and, upon her arrival on August 19, went to stay at
    her father’s home.  She tried unsuccessfully to contact her daughter to speak
    to her about the school and why she thought it was a bad idea for her to
    attend this school.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the morning of August 20, 2002, a process server served the appellant with
    a motion regarding custody of the daughter returnable on August 22.  The
    appellant tried to avoid service, but the documents were left with her father
    and were found in the appellant’s truck after the offence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant called Bailey and asked to speak to her daughter.  Bailey told
    her he was not sure he would let her see her daughter and told her he would
    call her back in five minutes after checking with someone.  He did not call
    back.  The appellant called again, spoke to Bailey’s second wife, and was
    told that Bailey was not there.  The appellant could hear Bailey in the background.  The
    appellant reached Bailey on his cell phone and he told her she could not
    see the other daughter until he arranged for supervised access.  This was
    a reference to the court proceedings that were to take place the next day. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant then went to the private school to seek assurances that they would
    not register her daughter. She received their assurance that they would not
    do that over the objections of the custodial parent.  The appellant also
    obtained a letter indicating the school would seek legal advice on whether
    to release her daughter’s file to her.  The appellant left the school and
    drove to see the managing editor of the local newspaper whom she asked to
    publish a negative expose about the school.  He refused to do so. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant went to her sister’s house, then shopping and out to dinner with
    her sister and her niece.  She was crying on and off throughout the evening
    and laughing inappropriately.  Ultimately she returned to her father’s home.  She
    again called Bailey’s house and asked to speak to her daughter, but did not
    succeed in doing so. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was very distraught and upset and could not sleep.  She planned
    to go to Bailey’s home the next day and ask to see her daughter in person.  At
    3:00 or 4:00&nbsp;a.m., she drove to Bailey’s home to get an idea of its
    location.  Before doing so, she took a gun that she knew her father had hidden
    in a wood stove, assembled and loaded it, and   tucked the gun inside her
    purse. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>She
    found Bailey’s house, and looked in the basement windows to see if her daughter
    was sleeping down there.  It was dark and she could see nothing.  She also
    found that the back door was open.  She entered the house, but left upon
    seeing dog bowls because she was afraid the dog would bark and wake the occupants
    of the house.  On her way out the door, she took a cell phone and wallet
    belonging to Bailey’s second wife.  She did not sleep the rest of the night.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    next morning, August 21, around 11:30 a.m., the appellant went back to Bailey’s
    house with her twenty-month old baby.  As it was a weekday, she did not expect
    Bailey to be home and hoped that her daughter would come to the door.  However,
    Bailey’s car was in the driveway.  She parked her truck at the end of the
    driveway blocking any vehicles from exiting.  She rang the doorbell, knocked
    on the door loudly and rang the doorbell again yelling for her daughter.  Bailey
    came to the door and refused to let her see her daughter on the basis that
    supervised access had not yet been arranged.  This was a reference to the
    pending court proceedings, returnable the next day, in which Bailey was seeking
    custody of the daughter.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    the appellant persisted, Bailey tried to get the appellant to leave.  When
    she would not, he pushed her backwards and although she did not fall, he
    did cause her to go down three stairs while holding the baby. Bailey told
    her, “this is my house” and “don’t come near my house”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Bailey
    also told the appellant she had better be careful because she might have
    a heart attack.  The appellant’s mother had died of a heart attack.  Having
    regard to her view of Bailey’s abusive and unsympathetic treatment of her
    in the past when she developed ulcerative colitis, the appellant perceived
    this as an attack on her.  Bailey went back inside the house.  He came back
    out talking to his lawyer on his cell phone and the appellant also spoke
    to the lawyer.  At one point in the conversation she modulated her voice
    and tone and staged a fake dialogue with the lawyer.  The lawyer asked her
    to give Bailey the phone, but the line went dead.  Bailey called him back.  The
    lawyer told Bailey that the appellant was entitled to see her daughter.  He
    also told Bailey to call the police.  Bailey told his lawyer he had not pushed
    the appellant.  The appellant heard mention of calling the police.  Bailey
    went inside, re-emerged with a phone, and called 911.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant said that seeing Bailey come out made her think back to when they
    were married ten years before.  She started to think her baby was in fact
    her daughter whom she had come to see.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Bailey
    told the 911 operator the appellant was trying to break into the house, which
    she loudly denied.  The appellant testified that she believed he was misrepresenting
    the situation because all she wanted to do was to speak to her daughter.  She
    felt afraid, confused and upset and as though he was manipulating her again
    like he used to.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thinking
    Bailey was somehow coming after her, she walked fifty feet back to her truck,
    put the baby in her truck and took out the gun.  She said her perception
    was distorted.  She knew she was reaching for the gun but was seeing herself
    through a tunnel.  Her perception was that she watched herself walk back
    and shoot Bailey.  She shot him in the head, firing from about 41/2 feet
    away.  Although he took no steps towards her, his body moved three or four
    inches toward her and she interpreted this as an aggressive act and emptied
    the gun into him.  She fired eight shots in rapid succession. </p>

  <h2>Appeal Against Conviction</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge ruled that there was no air of reality to the defence of provocation
    and that the defence could therefore not be put to the jury. Under s. 232(1)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, provocation may reduce second degree murder
    to manslaughter where the accused committed it “in the heat of passion caused
    by sudden provocation”. Subsection (2) provides that the wrongful act or
    insult must be of such a nature to be “sufficient to deprive an ordinary
    person of the power of self-control” and the accused must act on it “on the
    sudden and before there was time for his passion to cool”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    stated in <i>R. v. Osolin </i>(1993), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.) at 531,
    the term ‘air of reality’
    simply means that the trial judge must determine if the evidence put forward
    is such that, “if believed a reasonable jury properly charged could have
    acquitted”. The appellant concedes that if there was no air of reality to
    the appellant’s provocation defence, any errors in the trial judge’s ruling
    are irrelevant.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Despite
    counsel’s able submissions, we are not persuaded that the trial judge made
    any error in his conclusion that, on the objective portion of the test, there
    was no air of reality to the defence of provocation. First, the confrontation
    between the appellant and the deceased was not sudden, but lasted twenty
    minutes to half an hour. Second, although the confrontation was upsetting
    to the appellant, particularly given the past history between the two, the
    comments and actions of the deceased were not sufficient to deprive an ordinary
    person of the self-control that keeps a person from killing another person.
    More importantly, there is no air of reality that the accused was deprived
    of self control or that she acted “on the sudden”. To the contrary, during
    her telephone discussion with the deceased’s lawyer, she modulated her voice
    pretending to be co-operative. She then strode back to her truck with the
    baby, deposited the baby safely in the truck, retrieved the gun and shot
    the deceased eight times. These actions cannot be characterized as acting “on
    the sudden” or in the heat of passion and “before there was time for her
    passion to cool”.</p>

  <h2>Appeal Against Thirteen-Year Parole Ineligibility Period</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant asked for the statutory minimum of ten years for parole ineligibility.
    The Crown sought a period of seventeen years. Of the eleven members of the
    jury remaining to verdict, five recommended ten years, two recommended fifteen
    years, three recommended eighteen years and one recommended twenty years.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge gave thorough and comprehensive reasons for sentence, reviewing
    the mitigating and aggravating factors. He recognized the accepted range
    of parole ineligibility in cases of brutal domestic homicide as twelve to
    fifteen years. In choosing thirteen years, he went to the lower end of the
    range. He cited the following reasons for departing from the ten-year minimum:
    the murder was brutal, it was perpetrated on an unsuspecting victim in the
    context of a domestic dispute, it occurred on the doorstep of the deceased’s
    family residence when his wife and children were present in the house, and
    there were elements of planning and deliberation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    agree with the appellant that it would be an error to sentence based on a
    misconstruction of the jury verdict. In this case, the jury refused to convict
    on first degree murder based on planning and deliberation. However, we are
    satisfied that the judge’s choice of words was merely a reference to certain
    facts, and did not amount to error. He was entitled to take into account
    on sentence the fact that the appellant deliberately loaded a gun and brought
    it with her when she went to the deceased’s home. This was clearly an aggravating
    factor.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant also objects to a statement by the trial judge that the appellant “lulled” the
    deceased into a false sense of security. Again we see no error. Although
    the two were engaged in a confrontation, there was no warning that the appellant
    was either armed or potentially dangerous. Also, there was evidence that
    the appellant changed her tone with the lawyer on the phone apparently to
    lead Bailey to believe she was calming down.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    the appellant objects to reliance by the judge on cases which she characterizes
    as much worse than hers: <i>R. v. Barjrangie</i> <i>Singh</i> (2003), 174
    C.C.C. (3d) 351 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) and <i>R. v. McKnight </i>(1999), 135 C.C.C. (3d) 41 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ). We do not agree that the judge made any error in using those cases for
    guidance in these circumstances.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    we see no error in the trial judge’s decision to impose a period of thirteen
    years parole ineligibility, leave to appeal sentence is granted but the appeal
    is dismissed.</p>
