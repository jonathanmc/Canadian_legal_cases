style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant appeals from the dismissal of his motion to vary the support payments
    he owed his former spouse pursuant to the terms of a separation agreement
    which were incorporated into a consent support order.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant submits that the motions judge was not entitled to dismiss his
    motion as the substance of the motion was not before the motions judge.  He
    submits that only the procedural issue of whether to order a trial by <i>viva
    voce</i> evidence or by way of affidavit was before the court.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    disagree.  In addition to requesting the trial of an issue by <i>viva voce</i> evidence,
    the appellant’s amended notice of motion sought the deletion of the entirety
    of paragraph&nbsp;1 of the consent support order which provided that the
    support payments were not to be varied unless either of two events happened.  There
    is no issue that neither of these events has happened.  The appellant did
    not submit that the separation agreement was invalid.  The basis on which
    the variation of support was sought was that the appellant was not receiving
    the amounts he had anticipated from the business he had transferred to his
    son.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant’s amended notice of motion further sought repayment of the spousal
    support payments that had been made going back to February 26, 2000 when
    the respondent married her present husband.  Ultimately, remarriage was not
    a basis for variation and had been specifically removed from the change of
    circumstances in the amended separation agreement. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Prior
    to the appellant’s motion being decided, the appellant brought a motion to
    compel the respondent to provide financial disclosure.  This motion was heard
    together with a preliminary objection by the respondent wife to the husband’s
    ability to move to vary the consent order.  Goodman&nbsp;J. treated the objection
    as a motion for summary judgment by the respondent.  She held that she ought
    not to decide the issues in the absence of a full record and ordered full
    financial disclosure by the respondent within twenty-one days.  The appellant
    submits that Goodman J.’s decision made the question of whether to have the
    trial of an issue res judicata and the only outstanding issue was the form
    of the trial <span
style='font-family:"Century Gothic"'>&#8722;</span> <i>viva voce</i> or affidavit
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent submits that the motions judge heard submissions on the merits
    and was entitled to make a final order on the basis of the expanded record.
    The respondent submits she complied with the order for financial disclosure
    of Goodman J.  Further, she was examined on the material she filed on February
    28, 2006.  She also filed an affidavit in response to the appellant’s affidavit
    to which she attached a number of documents that were pertinent to the litigation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    agree with the respondent.  The matter was not <i>res judicata</i>.  The
    relief sought in the amended notice of motion before the motions judge was
    considerably broader than that sought before Goodman J.  In proceeding as
    he did, the motions judge had the benefit of a more complete record than
    that before Goodman J.  In view of the relief requested and the material
    before the motions judge, he was entitled to exercise his discretion as he
    did and he did not err in principle.  He was not obliged to limit himself
    to deciding whether to order the trial of an issue on <i>viva voce</i> evidence
    or not.  The respondent was not obliged to bring a cross motion.  The motions
    judge simply dismissed the request for the relief sought.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly
    the appeal is dismissed.  The respondent is entitled to have her costs of
    the appeal paid by the appellant and we fix those costs in the amount of
    $6000 all inclusive.</p>
