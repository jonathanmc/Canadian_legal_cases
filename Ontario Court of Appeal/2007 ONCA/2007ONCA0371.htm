  <h2 style='page-break-after:auto'>I.          Introduction</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    is an appeal from the jury verdict in a civil negligence action arising from
    a ‘slip and fall’ accident in the produce department of a grocery store,
    during which a store customer, the appellant Clara Margaret Kerr, sustained
    injuries to her right ankle.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    an eight-day trial, the jury concluded that the owner of the grocery store,
    the respondent Loblaws Inc., had taken such care as was reasonable under
    the circumstances to see that Ms. Kerr was reasonably safe while on the store
    premises.  The jury assessed Ms. Kerr’s total damages at $58,300.  In accordance
    with the jury verdict, the trial judge dismissed the action.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms.
    Kerr and various family members appeal the jury’s verdict on liability.  They
    challenge the trial judge’s instructions to the jury on the standard of care
    applicable in the circumstances and on the issue of causation.  They also
    argue that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the following reasons, I conclude that the trial judge’s charge properly
    identified the issues, the applicable legal principles, and the evidence
    on the key questions of the standard of care owed by Loblaws and whether
    that standard was met in the circumstances of this case.  I see no merit
    to the claim that the trial judge misdirected the jury on the issue of causation.  Finally,
    because there was evidence to support the jury’s verdict, I cannot say that
    it was unreasonable.  Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h2>II.        Facts</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    April 9, 2002, while shopping with a friend, Ms. Kerr slipped and fell on
    a single grape near a grape display in the produce department of a Zehrs’ grocery
    store owned by Loblaws.  Ms. Kerr was eighty years of age.  When she fell,
    she broke her ankle in three places and strained her knee.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    a result, Ms. Kerr underwent surgery on her ankle and was hospitalized for
    about eight days.  Thereafter, she convalesced in a nursing home for six
    weeks and participated in physiotherapy for two-and-a-half months.  Although
    the outcome of her surgery was positive, Ms. Kerr maintained that the injuries
    sustained by her in the accident caused a dramatic decline in her mobility
    and a significant reduction in the quality of her lifestyle.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the time of the accident, Zehrs’ floor care policy manual provided for the
    use of floor mats in front of grape displays to minimize the potential for
    accidents.  Zehrs’ policies also required the use of a “sweep log” to document
    floor inspections and maintenance in the produce department.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Contrary
    to the directions contained in Zehrs’ manual, floor mats were not in use
    in front of the Zehrs’ grape display on the day in question.  In addition,
    a copy of the manual had not been reviewed by the Zehrs’ store manager and
    no schedule for the conduct of hourly floor inspections was in place at the
    time of the incident.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    a sweep log was in use in the Zehrs’
    produce department.  The log entries for the morning of the accident documented
    floor inspections in the produce department at 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. – prior
    to Ms. Kerr’s fall – and, again, at 12:10 p.m. – shortly after her fall.  The
    log indicated that loose grapes were picked up from the floor at 8:00 a.m.  Other
    produce, located in an area of the produce section some distance away from
    where Ms. Kerr fell, was picked up during the inspection at 12:10 p.m.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Notably,
    on inspection after the accident, no grapes or other produce were discovered
    on the floor in the area of the grape display. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Following
    the accident, Ms. Kerr and three of her daughters sued Loblaws in negligence
    claiming damages for Ms. Kerr’s injuries, for expenses associated with her
    post-accident care, and for the loss of Ms. Kerr’s guidance, care and companionship.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Loblaws
    did not dispute that Ms. Kerr slipped and fell in the produce department
    of the Zehrs’ store.  However, it denied liability on the basis that it had
    taken reasonable steps to see that its customers were reasonably safe on
    the store premises.  Loblaws also maintained that Ms. Kerr’s injuries were
    occasioned by a constellation of pre-existing and deteriorating medical conditions
    and events unrelated to her fall at the Zehrs’ store.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    action was tried before a judge and jury in April 2006.  As I have said,
    the jury concluded that Loblaws was not negligent.  Therefore, by judgment
    dated April 20, 2006, the trial judge dismissed the action, without costs.   </p>
  <h2>III.       Issues</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    are three issues in this appeal:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Did
    the trial judge err in his charge to the jury on the requi-site standard
    of care?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Did
    the trial judge err in his charge to the jury on caus-ation?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Is
    the jury’s verdict on liability unreasonable?</p>
  <h2>IV.       Analysis</h2>
  <h2>            (1)       Instructions on the Standard of Care</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants assert that in directing the jury on the standard of care applicable
    in this case, the trial judge erred by failing to outline the precautions
    required to guard against the type of accident that occurred here.  The appellants
    say that where existing case law identifies “<i>indicia</i> of reasonableness” or “proper
    conduct” in relation to the standard of care applicable to an occupier of
    grocery store produce premises, a trial judge’s jury instructions regarding
    that standard must outline those <i>indicia</i> in order to provide the jury
    with adequate guidance on the nature of the applicable standard.  Stated
    somewhat differently, the appellants contend that Ontario case law establishes
    a specific standard of care for grocery store produce departments and that
    the trial judge erred by failing to particularize that standard for the jury.  I
    would reject these submissions for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms.
    Kerr’s negligence claim against Loblaws is based on Loblaws’ status as an
    occupier of the Zehrs’ store.  Section 3(1) of the <i>Occupiers’ Liability
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.2 (the “Act”) establishes the standard of care
    owed by occupiers.  It reads:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>An occupier of premises owes a duty to take such
    care as in all the circumstances of the case is reasonable to see that persons
    entering on the premises and the property brought on the premises by those
    persons are reasonably safe while on the premises.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    3(2) of the Act provides: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The duty of care provided for in subsection (1)
    applies whether the danger is caused by the condition of the premises or
    by an activity carried on on the premises.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge quoted these sections of the Act at the outset of his instructions
    to the jury concerning liability, indicating that the duty established by
    s. 3(1) applied to Loblaws.  He then elaborated as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Let us break that down.  Under the section I have
    just read to you <i>the duty of the defendant here was to take such care
    as was reasonably necessary in all the circumstances to see that persons
    like the plaintiff would be safe from injury when they came on the premises.  To
    put it another way, the duty cast upon the defendant was to make the premises
    reasonably safe for the plaintiff</i>.  The defendant is not required to
    protect the plaintiff against risks or dangers of which it could not reasonably
    have been aware.  Nor is there any obligation on the defendant to guard against
    any unusual or unreasonable use of the premises by the plaintiff.  In essence,
    members of the jury, <i>what you have to consider is whether the defendant
    took reasonable care in the circumstances by notice, by lighting, by guarding,
    by maintenance or otherwise to make the premises reasonably safe for the
    plaintiff</i>.  It is a question of fact for you.  You must determine what
    a reasonably prudent occupier of the premises would have done or refrained
    from doing in the circumstances of this case to make the premises safe for
    the plaintiff. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    stressed by the trial judge, the standard of care imposed on Loblaws in this
    case is a standard of reasonableness.  It requires neither perfection nor
    unrealistic or impractical precautions against known risks.  In my view,
    the above-quoted instructions by the trial judge properly drew the jury’s
    attention, in clear and precise terms, to Loblaws’ obligation to take such
    care as was reasonable in all the circumstances to make the Zehrs’ premises
    reasonably safe for customers.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Importantly,
    the trial judge also told the jury that it should assess whether Loblaws
    took reasonable care in the circumstances by considering the measures employed
    by it to render the Zehrs’ premises reasonably safe for Ms. Kerr, as a store
    patron, including such matters as notice, lighting, guarding, and maintenance.  The
    effect of this direction was to inform the jury that Loblaws was required
    by the standard of care set out in s. 3(1) of the Act to take positive steps
    to render the Zehrs’ store premises reasonably safe.  It also alerted the
    jury to its task of determining whether the steps taken by Loblaws were sufficient
    to discharge the burden placed on it by the Act.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    the trial judge’s instructions on the standard of care implicitly recognized
    the important distinction between the well-established roles of the trial
    judge and the jury in a civil negligence action.  In <i>Galaske v. O’Donnell</i>,
    [1994] 1 S.C.R. 670 at 694, Major J. of the Supreme Court of Canada – in
    dissent on other grounds – noted with approval the following passage from
    Professor Fleming’s textbook on <i>The Law of Torts</i>, 8th ed. (Sydney:
    Law Book Company, 1992) at 106:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is for the court to determine the existence of
    a duty relationship and to lay down in general terms the standard of care
    by which to measure the defendant’s conduct; it is for the jury to translate
    the general into a particular standard suitable for the case in hand and
    to decide whether that standard has been attained.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Justice
    Major explained at p. 694:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The judge, as a matter of law, must determine, in
    general terms, the obligation imposed upon the defendant. …Having established
    the standard of care in general terms, it is then a finding of fact to determine,
    in the context of a particular case, the obligation imposed on the defendant,
    and to determine whether or not that obligation was met.  [Citations omitted.]</p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, s. 3(1) of the Act established the particular standard of care
    to which Loblaws was bound.  The trial judge specifically referenced and
    explained that standard in his charge.  It remained for the jury, as the
    trier of fact, to evaluate the precautionary measures taken by Loblaws and
    to decide whether Loblaws had attained that standard.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    accept the appellants’ contention that trial judges are obliged in occupier
    liability cases tried by judge and jury to articulate the governing standard
    of care according to prior judicial decisions about conduct found to have
    satisfied, or to have fallen short of, the applicable standard would be to
    ignore the reality that the application of the standard of care in such cases
    is a fact-specific exercise that varies from case to case.  This important
    principle was emphasized by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Waldick v.

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>After all, <i>the statutory duty on occupiers is
      framed quite generally, as indeed it must be</i>.  That duty is to take
      reasonable care in the circumstances to make the premises safe.  That duty
      does not change but <i>the factors which are relevant to an assessment
      of what constitutes reasonable care will necessarily be very specific to

    more importantly, the court in

    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <i>Marche</i> expressly recognized that, in a given case, existing case law
    concerning preventative measures and responsive safety actions by occupiers,
    while useful, is ultimately not controlling of whether a particular occupier
    met the standard of care.  The court commented at paras. 30 and 31:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Case law provides valuable assistance to a judge
    in deter-mining whether the standard of care has been met.  However, as is
    apparent from the jurisprudence, what is required to meet the reasonableness
    standard will vary from case to case.  What meets the reasonableness standard
    in one situation may fall short in another.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The appellants urge that the facts of this case
    are close to, if not virtually identical with, those in cases it relied upon
    where the standard of care was found to have been met.  There may be strong
    correlations with the facts in other cases, but not surprisingly, there are
    often noteworthy differences.</p>

    agree.  The applicable standard of care in this case is one of reasonableness
    in the circumstances.  As observed by Lax J. of the Superior Court of Justice
    in <i>Chan v. Erin Mills Town Centre Corp.</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 5027 at para.
    42, “as circumstances vary from case to case, so do the requirements of meeting
    the statutory standard [under s. 3(1) of the Act]”.  It follows that I do
    not regard it as an error for a trial judge not to specify in his or her
    jury charge those factors accepted or rejected in other cases as being sufficient
    to meet the reasonableness standard established by s. 3(1) of the Act.  </p>

    the contrary, in my view, once a trial judge in an occupier liability case
    of this kind has properly identified and explained the relevant standard
    of care to the jury, as this trial judge did, it is unnecessary to embellish
    that standard by providing specific examples of how the standard was applied
    in other cases.  The issue of how the standard is met or breached in a given

    ‘slip and fall’ cases, like this one.  Thereafter, the following exchange
    took place:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Court:        Well, we’re talking about two

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Mr. Romaine:  <i>How you’ve explained the law is

    review of the evidence or of the positions of the parties on this issue.  As
    this court has said repeatedly, a failure by counsel to object to a jury

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having
    identified and explained the standard of care applicable in this case, and
    after directing the jury on the law regarding contributory negligence, the
    trial judge reviewed the positions of the parties concerning liability, and
    the evidence relied upon by them in support of their positions, in considerable
    detail.  In so doing, he expressly reminded the jury of the appellants’ contention
    that, in all the circumstances, Loblaws had failed to implement adequate
    measures to prevent and guard against accidents in the produce department
    of the Zehrs’
    store.  </p>

    his review, the trial judge identified for the jury the evidence relied upon
    by the appellants as demonstrating the need for reasonable safety measures
    by Loblaws and Loblaws’ alleged lack of reasonable care regarding the safety
    of the Zehrs’ store premises.  This included evidence of the known hazard
    arising from fallen grapes in a produce department; Zehrs’ alleged failure
    to adhere to the produce department safety measures outlined in its own internal
    policies; the absence of floor mats in front of Zehrs’ grape display; the
    alleged failure of Zehrs’ store personnel to sweep or mop the produce department
    floor; the absence of any detailed floor maintenance schedule for Zehrs’ produce
    department; the failure of Zehrs’ store manager to read Zehrs’ floor care
    policy manual and his alleged failure to instruct store personnel to follow
    Zehrs’ safety policies; and the failure of produce department staff to inspect
    the floors and to record such inspections in the sweep log on an hourly basis.</p>

    the trial judge outlined in his charge many of the factors said by the appellants
    to constitute inadequate or unreasonable conduct by Loblaws.  The fact that
    this outline formed part of the trial judge’s summary of the appellants’ position
    on liability, instead of a separate direction on liability, does not change
    the fact that the identified factors were placed squarely before the jury
    for its consideration and related specifically to the appellants’ theory
    of the case.  I note that this mirrored the approach of the appellants’ trial
    counsel, who reviewed many of the same factors in his closing address to
    the jury when pressing the appellants’ position on liability. </p>

    the result, therefore, this jury cannot have been left in any doubt about

  <h2>            (2)       Instructions on Causation </h2>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    was conceded at trial that Ms. Kerr slipped on a single grape in the Zehrs’ produce
    department.  However, there was some dispute between the parties about Ms.
    Kerr’s exact position in relation to the grape display when she fell.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Essentially,
    Loblaws relied on Ms. Kerr’s evidence of her position in relation to the
    grape display at the time of the accident to argue that the presence of a
    floor mat by the display would not have prevented or minimized the potential
    for her accident.  Rather, given her position – two steps away from her shopping
    cart and the grape display – Loblaws maintained that the presence or absence
    of a floor mat in front of the grape display was irrelevant. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants submit that this is a causation defence.  They argue that causation
    was not in issue in this case (save with respect to damages), and that the
    evidence at trial was insufficient to require a causation instruction.  The
    appellants assert that, having elected nonetheless to instruct the jury on
    the issue of Ms. Kerr’s position at the time of the accident, the trial judge
    erred by failing to tell the jury that a determination of Ms. Kerr’s precise
    position at the time of her fall was unnecessary to a finding that Loblaws
    was liable.  See for example, <i>Kamin v. Kawartha Dairy Ltd.</i> (2006),
    79 O.R. (3d) 284 (
    <st1:place

style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s description of Loblaws’ theory concerning Ms. Kerr’s position
    at the time of the accident formed only a small part of the jury charge – five
    sentences in total – during a relatively detailed overview by the trial judge
    of the theory of the defence and the evidence relied upon by the defence
    in support of its denial of liability.  The charge itself was fifty-five
    pages in length.  In this context, the trial judge’s impugned remarks were
    insignificant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    trial counsel for Loblaws mentioned the same evidence and the same defence
    contention – that the presence of a floor mat in front of the grape display
    would have been irrelevant due to Ms. Kerr’s position when she fell – in
    his closing address to the jury.  No objection was taken by the appellants
    to this closing address, or to the inclusion by the trial judge of the impugned
    statements in his jury charge.  This suggests that counsel did not regard
    the trial judge’s comments on this issue as significant or prejudicial.  This
    too militates in favour of the conclusion that the comments in question were
    of little moment.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    both parties agree that the central liability issues in this case concerned
    the standard of care to which Loblaws was bound and whether that standard
    had been breached.  This was made clear to the jury in both the jury charge
    and the closing addresses of counsel.  It was also confirmed by the fact
    that no question regarding causation was posed for determination by the jury.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    these circumstances, I am not persuaded that the jury would have been misled
    or unfairly influenced by the references made to Ms. Kerr’s position at the
    time of the accident.  On this record, there is no basis to conclude that
    the jury’s liability finding was premised on the type of causation considerations
    now challenged by the appellants.  Accordingly, I would reject this ground
    of appeal.  </p>

    it is “so plainly unreasonable and unjust as to satisfy the Court that no
    jury reviewing the evidence as a whole and acting judicially could have reached
    it”: <i>McCannell v. McLean</i>, [1937] S.C.R. 341 at 343, quoted with approval

    completing their duties.  He testified that:</p>

    Young also said that, although Zehrs’ goal was to document floor inspections
    in the produce department sweep log on an hourly basis, the times of inspections
    recorded in the log did not represent the only times that the floors were
    inspected or cleaned in that section of the store.  According to Mr. Young,
    store employees were instructed:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>If there was anything found out of place or discarded
    on the floor, to certainly manage that, pick it up, and in the produce department
    specifically to the best of their ability make a record on their sweep log
    at least every hour.  We didn’t write down everything that we picked up through
    the course of the day, but my expectation was to the best of their ability
    every hour to make record. </p>

    connection with the use of floor mats in the Zehrs’ store, although no mats
    were in place in front of the grape display prior to the accident, Mr. Young
    said that mats were utilized in those areas of the produce department where
    produce ‘misting’ equipment was employed.  </p>

    addition to the evidence of Mr. Young, James Huygen, a Zehrs’ produce depart-ment

    particular, there was evidence upon which the jury could rely indicating
    that Loblaws took reasonable steps to ensure that the floor of the produce
    department at the Zehrs’ store was clean and clear of debris and fallen produce,
    and that Loblaws had a detailed floor maintenance program in place, consisting
    of recorded inspections and regular employee checks and cleaning of the produce
    department floors.  There was also evidence that Zehrs’ produce department
    employees actually checked the floors and removed any fallen items on a regular
    basis.  I note, as well, that there is no suggestion here that the problem
    of accidents from fallen grapes was a recurring issue at this Zehrs’ store,
    or that the employees of this store treated their maintenance and inspection
    duties as an <i>ad hoc</i> or casual requirement.</p>

    the fact that floor mats were not in use in front of the grape display on
    the day of the accident was one factor, among many, to be considered by the
    jury in determining whether Loblaws had met the standard of care required
    in the circumstances.  It was open to the jury to determine what weight should
