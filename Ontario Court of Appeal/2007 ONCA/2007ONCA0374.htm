    appellant appeals his convictions of sexual assault, touching for a sexual
    purpose, and two counts of incest, as well as his sentence of three and a
    half years in custody imposed for these convictions.  The convictions arose
    out of acts which the trial judge found were carried out by the appellant
    against his daughter.  The only evidence against him at trial was a video
    statement given to the police by his twelve-year-old daughter that was admitted
    for the truth of its contents.  At trial, the appellant’s daughter recanted
    and testified she had lied to the police about her father’s actions.</p>

    complainant gave an unsworn video statement to the police in which she alleged
    that her father sexually assaulted her over a three year period, beginning
    when she was in grade four.  The assaults began with inappropriate touching
    and quickly escalated to intercourse.  She said that her father would enter
    her room, which she shared with her brother, at night and would have sexual
    intercourse with her.  She described in detail the acts of intercourse and
    the movement of her father on top of her.  She also provided a detailed description
    of the use of condoms, including how after intercourse her father would remove
    the condom, roll it up, put it in a tissue, and dispose of it in the washroom.  She
    said her father would direct her to clean herself up after sex.  She said
    that initially and for some time she was assaulted nightly, but that the
    assaults decreased in frequency over time.  She said the final assault occurred
    in September 2004.  They ended after her mother learned of the sexual abuse.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the video statement, the complainant provided the names of fourteen friends
    and an adult family friend, K., to whom she said she had disclosed her allegations.  She
    said she initially confided in K. and made him promise not to tell anybody.  She
    said K. initially planned to have her put in a foster home or call the police
    but she asked him not to.  She said that three or four months later K. told
    her mother about the sexual assault.  Her mother asked her about it and,
    after initially denying anything had occurred, she told her mother that her
    father “sticks it into my vagina and stuff.”  She said that after she told
    her mother about the abuse, it stopped.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the complainant recanted these allegations.  She was thirteen years
    old and entering grade eight the next school year when she testified in July
    2005.  She testified that she had been with a group of female friends and
    a discussion about sex had taken place.  One of her friends believed that
    the complainant had alleged her father had raped her.  That friend told another
    friend, who told her mother, who contacted the school, who notified the Children’s
    Aid Society (the
    “CAS”).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    intake worker from the CAS attended the school and spoke to the complainant,
    who said she was surprised to be summonsed to the vice-principal’s office
    in the middle of the day.  This happened on March 1, 2005.  The intake worker,
    the complainant testified, told her she knew that the complainant had told
    her friends her father was raping her.  The complainant said she became upset,
    scared, and nervous.  She said she felt that the intake worker pressured
    her to confirm the allegations.  She testified she initially told the intake
    worker the allegations were not true, but later admitted she may simply have
    said it was not happening anymore.  Eventually the complainant told the intake
    worker her father put a condom on “his dick” and pushed it into her vagina.  The
    complainant accompanied the intake worker to the police station where she
    gave the video statement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the complainant testified what she said on the video statement was
    all lies and that she had never been sexually assaulted by her father.  She
    said that while she felt pressured by the CAS intake worker when she made
    the video statement, she also testified that she was able to tell the truth
    to the court because both her mother and the CAS social worker were present
    to support her.  When asked about the details she provided about the use
    of the condom, she explained that she had learned how condoms were used and
    disposed of from a sexually active friend.  She said she added the detail
    about the condom because she wanted to avoid a physical examination.  The
    complainant testified that she had not told anyone prior to March 1, 2005
    about the allegations.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown did not call any of the fourteen friends identified by the complainant
    in her video statement to say that she had complained to them of the sexual
    abuse.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    family friend, K., who acted as the appellant’s surety before trial, testified
    on behalf of the defence and denied that the complainant had disclosed any
    sexual abuse to him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant’s family doctor also testified.  She had examined the complainant
    on March 23, 2005 at the request of the mother.  The doctor testified that
    the complainant’s hymen was intact.  On the basis of her physical examination
    of the complainant, the doctor testified she came to the conclusion that
    the complainant had not had sexual intercourse.  Under cross-examination
    by the Crown, the doctor readily acknowledged that sometimes the hymen, particularly
    in persons thirteen and younger, is quite elastic.  In such cases, the hymen
    could remain intact even though there had been penetration.  When asked by
    the judge to quantify what she meant by “possible”, the doctor responded, “In
    her case the hymen was small, so you have to put the small gadget to check
    inside or take the swabs … which I can’t do with the small, small hole in
    the hymen.”  In re-examination, the doctor said that if a hymen is elastic
    it could remain intact even after fifty instances of intercourse. </p>

    admissibility of hearsay evidence is reviewed on a standard of correctness.  However,
    absent manifest error, the findings of fact made by the trial judge deserve
    deference: <i>R. v. Merz</i> (1999), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 259 at para. 49 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge correctly indicated that the video’s admissibility depended on
    its necessity and threshold reliability.  He noted that the defence conceded
    that the statement was necessary.  In terms of reliability, despite some
    confusion on the part of the complainant, it is apparent that the entire
    interview with her was video recorded.  The trial judge found that the complainant
    appreciated the need to be truthful even though there was no oath administered
    and she was not told that the video statement might be used in court.  He
    commented that the complainant knew she was at a police station and that
    the two persons interviewing her were police officers.  He observed that
    less than two hours elapsed from the time the complainant met the intake
    worker at the school to when she found herself at the police station being
    video recorded.  It is worth noting that the complainant did not testify
    under oath at trial.  At trial she promised to tell the truth.  The trial
    judge concluded that the circumstances surrounding the taking of the video
    statement were an adequate substitute for an oath and decided the statement
    was admissible under the principle of <i>R. v.</i> <i>B. (K.G.)</i> (1993),
    79 C.C.C. (3d) 257 (S.C.C.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, the appellant submits that the statement ought not to have been admitted
    according to the Supreme Court of Canada’s recent decision in <i>R. v. Khelawon </i>(2006),
    215 C.C.C. (3d) 161 (S.C.C.), which was released after the decision in this
    case.  The appellant submits that according to <i>Khelawon</i> the trial
    judge should have considered evidence that conflicted with the video statement
    in determining its admissibility.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Khelawon</i>,
    Charron J. explained that the factors a court must consider in deciding whether
    to admit hearsay under the principled approach cannot be categorized in terms
    of threshold and ultimate reliability.  She notes, at para. 54, confusion
    has resulted from the “attempt to categorically label some factors as going
    only to ultimate reliability.”  Considering “corroborating or conflicting
    evidence” as only relevant to ultimate reliability is an example.  Charron
    J., in <i>Khelawon</i>, put forward a new functional approach in which the
    factors to be considered at the threshold reliability stage could include
    the presence of supporting or contradictory evidence in appropriate cases.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant relies on <i>Khelawon</i> to submit that the complainant’s recantation
    establishes indisputably that she is capable of fabrication, thus undermining
    the reliability of the prior statement.  He goes on to argue that the fact
    that the testimony of both the family doctor and K. contradicted the daughter’s
    video statement, coupled with the complete lack of corroborating evidence
    for the statement, constitute additional reasons why it should have been
    regarded as lacking sufficient reliability to justify its admission for the
    truth of its contents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the appellant misreads <i>Khelawon</i>.  <i>Khelawon </i>did not
    disturb the essential distinction between threshold reliability and ultimate
    reliability.  Charron J. explained that the trial judge still acts as a gate-keeper
    to preliminarily assess the threshold reliability of the hearsay statement
    leaving the ultimate determination of its worth to the fact-finder at trial.  The
    new insight of <i>Khelawon</i> is that the factors relevant on an admissibility
    inquiry cannot be said categorically to relate to either threshold or ultimate
    reliability.  Rather, the court must employ a functional approach by first
    identifying the particular dangers posed by the proffered hearsay and then
    considering whether those dangers may be adequately overcome so that the
    hearsay may be considered sufficiently reliable to be admitted for consideration
    by the trier of fact.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Charron
    J. observes at paras. 61-63 of <i>Khelawon</i> that the reliability requirement
    will generally be met in one of two ways:</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber3>(1) that there is no real concern about whether the
    statement is true or not because of the circumstances in which it came about;
    or</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber3>(2) that no real concern arises from the fact that
    the statement is presented in a hearsay form because, in the circumstances,

    than contemporaneous cross-examination.</p>

    not be read, as the appellant suggests, as requiring the consideration of
    supporting or contradictory evidence in every case.  If that were so, then
    the <i>voir dire</i> would overtake the trial.  The question is where to
    draw the line.  In discussing that question, Charron J. referred to the court’s
    decision in <i>R .v. Hawkins</i> (1996), 111 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (S.C.C.).  In
    that case a witness testified against a police officer at his preliminary
    inquiry, then brought an application to testify again and recanted her initial
    testimony.  By the time of trial the witness had become the accused’s wife
    and could not testify because of spousal incompetency.  At trial, the Crown
    sought to rely on her testimony at the preliminary inquiry.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the case reached the Supreme Court, the court held that generally a witness’s
    testimony before a preliminary inquiry will satisfy the test for threshold
    reliability because it was given under oath and was subject to contemporaneous
    cross-examination in a hearing involving the same parties and mainly the
    same issues.  These features provided sufficient guarantees of its trustworthiness.  Moreover
    the accuracy of the transcript of the statement was certified.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
    is important to the discussion here, is that the majority found that the
    simple fact the witness’s testimony at the preliminary inquiry contained
    internal contradictions due to her recantation did not provide a basis for
    excluding it.  These contradictions related to the ultimate assessment of
    the actual probative value of the testimony and were a matter for the trier
    of fact to assess.  In <i>Khelawon</i>, Charron J., while disapproving of
    the discussion in <i>Hawkins</i> that categorized factors as relevant to
    either threshold or ultimate reliability, stated that the case “exemplifies
    where the line should be drawn on an inquiry into threshold reliability”:
    at para. 92.  She continued:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>When the reliability
    requirement is met on the basis that the trier of fact has a sufficient basis
    to assess the statement’s truth and accuracy, there is no need to inquire
    further into the likely truth of the statement.  That question becomes one
    that is entirely left to the ultimate trier of fact and the trial judge is
    exceeding his or her role by inquiring into the likely truth of the statement.  When
    reliability is dependent on the inherent trustworthiness of the statement,
    the trial judge must inquire into those factors tending to show that the
    statement is true or not – recall <i>U. (F.J.)</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying
    the functional approach of <i>Khelawon</i> to this case, the particular danger
    raised is that the appellant had no opportunity to conduct a contemporaneous
    cross-examination of the complainant when she made her video statement.  In
    my view, this danger is sufficiently overcome by the availability of the
    complainant to be cross-examined at trial together with those attributes
    of the statement that led the trial judge to admit it under <i>B. (K.G.)</i>.  As
    Charron J. said at para. 66 of <i>Khelawon</i> “the availability of the declarant
    for cross-examination goes a long way to satisfying the requirement for adequate
    substitutes.”  The remainder of the way is provided by the complete and accurate
    video record of her statement in which her demeanour could be observed and
    by the trial judge’s conclusion that there was an adequate substitute for
    an oath.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would conclude that the danger posed by the hearsay is sufficiently overcome
    in this case.  The complainant’s recantation at trial, K.’s denial that the
    complainant had made a report to him, and the doctor’s testimony were all
    matters to be considered in determining the statement’s ultimate reliability
    at the trial.  Since there was a sufficient basis for assessing the video
    statement’s truth and accuracy, it was unnecessary for the trial judge to “inquire
    further into the likely truth of the statement” by considering this additional
    evidence at the threshold stage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would conclude that the trial judge did not err in not considering contradictory
    evidence in determining the hearsay statement’s admissibility.  The appellant
    has not shown any basis for interfering with the trial judge’s decision to
    admit the statement.  </p>

    trial judge was faced with two contradictory stories by the complainant.  In
    her video statement to the police, described above, the complainant stated
    that she was sexually abused by her father.  At trial, she said she had lied
    to the police because she was nervous, scared, and did not trust the CAS
    intake worker.  She testified that she made up details, such as her father
    wearing a condom, in order to avoid undergoing physical tests.  The trial
    judge commented that the complainant offered both versions with the same
    apparently credible demeanour.  Both on the video and in court she testified
    calmly and answered questions naturally and without hesitation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    choosing to believe what the complainant said on the video, the trial judge
    committed several analytical errors.  The most significant of these is that
    he did not properly apply <i>R. v. W. (D)</i> <i>(</i>1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d)
    397 (S.C.C.)<i>.</i>  These errors require that the appeal be allowed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the trial judge noted that on the video the complainant claimed she told
    fourteen classmates and a family friend, K. about the abuse.  She offered
    specific names, and this the trial judge reasoned, indicated she was telling
    the truth.  He said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>[I]t would be ridiculous not to expect, and it’s inconceivable that she
    could not expect that somebody in those names is going to be contacted.  That
    does not advance a lie.  That bespeaks of speaking the truth.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    reasoning is faulty.  The same rationale could be applied to indicate her
    testimony in court was the truth.  When the complainant denied in court that
    she had ever disclosed allegations of sexual abuse to any of the persons
    she had named in the video statement, she would expect a lie to be easily
    exposed.  It is inconceivable she would not expect the police to contact
    the named persons to prove her denial in court was a lie.  Thus this reasoning
    can be applied to both the video statement and the testimony in court.  If
    anything, the reasoning would favour preferring the trial testimony.  The
    Crown did not call any person named by the complainant on the video statement
    to testify.  The defence called K. whose testimony was consistent with the
    complainant’s evidence at trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would conclude the trial judge erred by employing this reasoning to believe
    the video statement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    while he described it as a minor factor at one point, the trial judge focused
    on the fact the complainant had no motive to fabricate the allegations of
    sexual abuse.  He said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>Not that there necessarily needs to be a reason for anyone to tell a lie,
    whether she’s a 13-year-old saying ‘I lied about what my father did to me’,
    neither her nor her father nor is there any piece of evidence that would
    logically lead to any reasonable or even unreasonable view from a 13-year-old
    as to why there would be any motivation to make up what are obviously very
    serious matters …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge observed that the complainant had no reason to fabricate allegations
    of sexual abuse.  He said “there was no reason that I could glean from any
    of the evidence, inferentially or otherwise, as to why this lie would be
    made up.”  Although lack of a motive to lie is a factor that can be considered
    in assessing the credibility of a witness, the trial judge appears to have
    used it as the reason for concluding that she was telling the truth without
    testing her credibility and reliability in light of all of the evidence presented
    at trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the trial judge referred to <i>R. v.</i> <i>W. (D.)</i>, in my view it is
    apparent he did not apply it.  Upon explaining that he accepted what the
    complainant said in her video statement he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>I accept that as being reliable evidence and if it’s necessary, to reject
    [K.’s] evidence and of course the accused’s evidence is implicitly and I’m

    the reasons I gave.</p>

line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    passage suggests that the trial judge engaged in the forbidden reasoning
    discussed in <i><span
lang=EN-US>R. v. Maharaj</span></i><span

    to S.C.C. refused, </span>[2004] S.C.C.A. No. 340, by believing that his
    acceptance of the video statement as reliable inevitably led to a rejection
    of the appellant’s evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.  As noted in <i>Maharaj</i>,
    at para. 30, “This reasoning is forbidden because it appears to shift the
    burden of proof on to the appellant to explain away the complainant’s evidence.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    was not a strong Crown case.  The Crown relied almost exclusively on the
    video statement of the complainant.  Though the trial judge accepted the
    statement as reliable he ought to have considered whether the appellant’s
    testimony at trial, the testimony of K. and the family doctor and the evidence
    that many of the alleged assaults occurred with the complainant’s brother
    in the room raised a reasonable doubt.  In his reasons the trial judge never
    did conclude that the Crown had proved the charges against the appellant
    beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
