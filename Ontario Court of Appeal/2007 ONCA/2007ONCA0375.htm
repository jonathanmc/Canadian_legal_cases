    March 14, 2007, we released our decision reversing an order of the
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    Divisional Court dismissing Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds’ claim against Dr. Smith on
    the ground that it failed to disclose a reasonable cause of action, as required
    by subrule&nbsp;21.01(1)(b) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>.  We reversed
    for the reason that the majority of the
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    <st1:Street
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court had erred in the application of the “plain and obvious” test
    that is central to subrule&nbsp;21.01(1)(b).  As a result of our decision,
    Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds may now proceed to trial on her claim that Dr.&nbsp;Smith
    negligently performed an autopsy on her child.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    agreed that Ms. Reynolds is to receive her costs of the appeal in the amount
    of $10,000.  Counsel requested the opportunity to determine whether they
    could agree to the amount of costs of related proceedings, and when these
    costs were to be paid to Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds by Dr.&nbsp;Smith.  Counsel have
    agreed that the total costs of all proceedings, including the appeal, are
    $44,000.  However they cannot agree when Dr.&nbsp;Smith should pay Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds
    her costs.<a

style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds’ position that the court should fix costs in the amount
    agreed to by counsel and order that they be paid within thirty days.  Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds
    is impecunious.  Her counsel has, in effect, been representing her <i>pro
    bono</i>.  If she succeeds at trial, it is reasonable to expect that costs
    will follow the event and her counsel will then be compensated in part for
    his fees and will be able to recover his disbursements.  Moreover, the outcome
    of the trial can have no effect upon Dr.&nbsp;Smith’s obligation to pay the
    costs of the appeal and the related proceedings.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.&nbsp;Smith
    opposes Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds’
    contention, and submits that the proper order is that costs should be payable
    in the cause.  He submits that following a trial he might be found to be
    immune from suit.  He argues that where the issue on an appeal will be re&#8209;litigated
    at the trial it is appropriate that costs be in the cause.  In the alternative,
    Dr.&nbsp;Smith submits that he pay the costs into court to stand as security
    for his own costs, should he be successful at trial.  He claims that it would
    be unfair to order that he pay Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds her costs in circumstances
    where he might be unable to recover his costs of a successful trial from
    her.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    agree with the position taken by counsel for Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds.  The claims
    advanced by her are novel, and in focusing on the integrity of the system
    in place in the province for conducting autopsies on infants and young children,
    involve matters of public importance.  However, it is important to separate
    the purpose of Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds’ appeal and the proceedings that preceded
    it, and the forthcoming trial.  Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds has struggled for five
    years to win the right to proceed to trial.  Dr.&nbsp;Smith has vigorously
    opposed her right to trial at every step of the way.  She was forced to come
    to this court simply to have her right to trial confirmed.  The issues to
    be determined at trial will be Dr.&nbsp;Smith’s immunity from suit and his
    liability for negligently conducting an autopsy.  As neither issue was determined
    on Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds’ appeal to this court, this is not a case in which the
    issues before the Court of Appeal will be litigated at trial, a situation
    in which an order that costs be in the cause is sometimes appropriate.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    in our view, the costs of the appeal and the related proceedings are stand
    alone costs incurred by an impecunious litigant who wants her day in court.  These
    costs are unrelated to the costs of the eventual trial.  We see no reason
    in principle why Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds should not be paid her hard won costs
    now.  Nor do we see any reason in principle why the costs should be paid
    into court.  In our view, the agreed costs of $44,000 must be paid forthwith.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Taking
    on an important cause as that of Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds on what, in effect, is
    a <i>pro&nbsp;bono</i> basis is in the best tradition of the legal profession.  To
    do so often results in a financial sacrifice on the part of a lawyer as he
    or she is not paid for legal services or disbursements as the litigation
    moves through the system.  As other courts have observed, through the ordering
    of costs payable forthwith during the cause of what is often protracted litigation,
    the financial burden assumed by lawyers accepting retainers <i>pro&nbsp;bono</i> is
    reduced.  Orders of this nature will assist in more people, like Ms.&nbsp;Reynolds,
    having access to justice as they will permit more lawyers to accept this
    type of retainer.  See <i>1465778 Ontario Inc. v. 1122077 Ontario Ltd.</i> (2006),
