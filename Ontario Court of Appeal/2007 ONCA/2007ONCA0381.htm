    appellant appeals the dismissal of her claim brought January 29, 2003 for
    retroactive child support payments for the period from May 1, 1997 to January
    1, 2003.  Her claim was dismissed on June 29, 2004, before the Supreme Court
    of Canada dealt with the subject of retroactive child support in <i>D.B.S.
    v. S.R.G.; L.J.W. v. T.A.R.; Henry v. Henry; Hienstra v. Hienstra</i>, [2006]
    2 S.C.R. 231.  This appeal was stayed pending the release of the Supreme

    parties were married in 1983 and have three children.  When they separated
    in 1993 the children were 10, 8, and 6 years old.  They entered into a comprehensive
    separation agreement (the “Separation Agreement”) in 1994 and divorced.  At
    the time of the trial of this claim the children were aged 20, 19, and 17.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

    the separation, the respondent’s ability to work was impaired for some time
    and his income dropped from $159,000 in 1993 to $60,000 in 1994.  The Separation
    Agreement provided that he would pay child support of $2,010 a month indexed
    to the Consumer Price Index for

    1996, the respondent began working for a new employer and his income increased
    dramatically to over $1 million a year in 2000.  His income at the time of
    trial was $777,000.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

    1998, when the <i>Federal</i> <i>Child Support Guidelines</i> (the “<i>Guidelines</i>”)
    came into effect, the respondent increased his child support payments to
    $3,000 a month.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    December of 2002 the appellant gave the respondent notice of her claim for
    retroactive child support along with a request for additional child support.  The
    trial judge dismissed the claim for retroactive child support after making
    the following findings:</p>
  <p class=MsoListContinue2CxSpFirst>1.         The Separation Agreement did
    not impose an obligation on the respondent to disclose material increases
    in his income.</p>
  <p class=MsoListContinue2CxSpMiddle>2.         The needs of the children were
    met during the period covered by the claim for retroactive child support
    and the appellant did not incur debt or encroach on her capital to meet those
    needs.</p>
  <p class=MsoListContinue2CxSpMiddle>3.         In the circumstances of this
    case, the respondent’s failure to disclose that his income had materially
    increased was not blameworthy conduct.</p>
  <p class=MsoListContinue2CxSpMiddle>4.         By 1997 the appellant knew that
    the respondent’s financial circumstances had improved considerably since
    the separation, though she did not know the extent of that improvement.  She
    also never asked the respondent to disclose the extent of that improvement.  The
    trial judge carefully considered the evidence of the appellant but did not
    find that the appellant’s fear of conflict excused her delay in bringing
    an application for increased child support.</p>
  <p class=MsoListContinue2CxSpLast>5.         An order for retroactive child
    support in the amount of $300,000 or more would cause an unfair burden to
    the respondent and could impair his ability to meet his ongoing support obligations.  Such
    an award would achieve no purpose other than to re-distribute capital from
    the respondent to the appellant.</p>

    dismissed the claim for retroactive child support, the trial judge ordered
    ongoing child support for the two remaining children of the marriage according
    to the <i>Guidelines</i> based on the respondent’s income of $777,000.  In
    addition, she ordered the respondent to pay 95% of the children’s educational
    expenses.</p>
  <h3>Issues</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in two respects:</p>
  <p class=MsoListContinue2CxSpFirst>1.         The trial judge erred in interpreting
    the Separation Agreement and failing to find that the agreement required
    the respondent to disclose material changes to his income.</p>
  <p class=MsoListContinue2CxSpLast>2.         The trial judge erred by applying
    the restrictive
    <st1:State w:st="on">

    Court in <i>D.B.S.</i>, <i>supra</i>. </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    do not agree with either contention.</p>
  <h5>Issue One: The Separation Agreement</h5>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    the Supreme Court recognized in <i>D.B.S.</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 58,
    the system crafted by Parliament did “not burden the payor parent with an
    automatic disclosure obligation every time his/her income increases”.  The
    question here is whether the Separation Agreement expressly or implicitly
    required the respondent to disclose the increase to his income. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Separation Agreement in this case did not expressly require the respondent
    to disclose his income.  The question is whether the obligation to do so
    was implicit in the Separation Agreement.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant relies on clause 3.2(a) of the Separation Agreement, located in
    the section regarding custody and access of the children, that provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='
text-align:left'>The parties agree to keep each other fully informed of all major
    matters affecting the interest and well being of the children and they will
    confer as often as necessary on matters affecting the children …</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    the clause’s location in the agreement the clause may not be an overriding
    consideration, I agree with the trial judge’s reasons for distinguishing
    the case before her from <i>Marinangeli</i> <i>v.</i> <i>Marinangeli</i> (2003),
    66 O.R. (3d) 40 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  In <i>Marinangeli</i>, the appellant’s pre-settlement representations,
    and the almost immediate significant improvement in his financial position
    after the minutes were signed, provided the factual basis for the implied
    duty of disclosure.  Implication of the duty to disclose was necessary to
    make the transaction effective.  Equivalent circumstances are not present
    in this case.  Rather, as the trial judge found, the respondent had not misled
    the appellant as to his financial circumstances and had not provided her
    with incomplete financial disclosure at the time they entered into the Separation
    Agreement.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would not interfere with the trial judge’s conclusion that it was not an
    implicit requirement of the Separation Agreement that the respondent discloses
    the increase in his income.</p>
  <h5>Issue Two: Application of D.B.S.</h5>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant submits that the legal regime that applied in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario at the time of the trial decision has been displaced by the Supreme
    Court’s subsequent decision in <i>D.B.S.</i>, <i>supra</i>. There are, she
    submits, two reasons why the trial judge’s decision should be overturned.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    while this court stated in <i>Marinangeli</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 72,
    that the
    “decision to award retroactive child support is one to be exercised sparingly”,
    the Supreme Court in <i>D.B.S.</i>, <i>supra</i>, emphasized that retroactive
    child support awards should not be regarded as exceptional orders to be made
    only in exceptional circumstances.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, <i>D.B.S.</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    restates the factors to be considered when a court is considering whether
    to award retroactive child support.  The appellant submits that the trial
    judge did not apply the <i>D.B.S.</i> analytical framework and that she erred
    by finding the respondent had not engaged in blameworthy conduct.  The appellant
    also submits that, when making her decision the trial judge took into account
    irrelevant factors, such as whether the award would constitute a transfer
    of wealth.<span lang=EN-US style='"Times New Roman";'> </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    agree with the appellant’s submission that <i>D.B.S.</i>, <i>supra</i>, has
    made some changes to the legal regime that was in effect in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario at the time of the trial decision.  In light of <i>D.S.B.</i> it
    is now clear that the trial judge erred in concluding the respondent had
    not engaged in blameworthy conduct.  In <i>D.B.S.</i>, Bastarache J. indicated
    that any conduct that privileges the payor parent’s own interests over his
    or her children’s right to an appropriate amount of support should be characterized
    as blameworthy conduct.  While there is a presumption that the payor parent
    is acting reasonably by complying with the terms of a previous court order
    or agreement, this presumption may be rebutted where the change in circumstances
    is sufficiently pronounced.  In determining the reasonability of the payor
    parent’s belief that his or her obligations were being met, the court should
    compare the amount the parent actually paid with how much he or she should
    have paid.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Applying
    this approach to this case, the respondent’s failure to report the increase
    in his income must be seen as blameworthy conduct given the magnitude of
    that increase. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent’s blameworthy conduct in failing to report the increase in his
    income militates in favour of a retroactive award, but it is not determinative.  It
    is only one of four factors Bastarache identified, at paras. 100-116, to
    be considered:<u> </u></p>
  <p>1.         Reasonable excuse for why support was not sought earlier</p>
  <p>2.         Conduct of the payor parent </p>
  <p>3.         Circumstances of the child </p>
  <p>4.         Hardship occasioned by a retroactive award</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Importantly,
    Bastarache stressed at para. 99 of <i>D.B.S.</i>, <i>supra</i>, “At all times,
    a court should strive for a holistic view of the matter and decide each case
    on the basis of its particular factual matrix.”</p>

    my view, the trial judge used an approach consonant with <i>D.B.S.</i>, <i>supra</i>.  She
    carefully considered the entire factual matrix of the application.  Her conclusion
    was based on a holistic consideration of all the factors and she bore all
    of them in mind in concluding that a retroactive award was not appropriate.  While
    her finding that the respondent had not engaged in blameworthy conduct was
    an error, and while some of the language may not be reflective of the principles
    in <i>D.B.S.</i>, her findings of fact and her weighing of the various factors
    is deserving of deference.</p>

    regard to her finding that there was no blameworthy conduct, it is worth
    observing that the trial judge indicated some disapproval of the respondent’s
    conduct in recognizing the logic that a support recipient should not have
    to ask a payor parent if there has been a material change in his or her circumstances.  It
    should be noted that the trial judge found there was no allegation that the
    respondent misled the appellant as to his financial circumstances and that
    by 1997 the appellant knew his financial circumstances had improved significantly.  She
    also noted that the respondent had never refused the appellant’s requests
    for extra financial assistance except for one request to pay for a trip to
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Cuba</st1:country-region>
    .  In her testimony at trial the appellant acknowledged that the amount of
    the extra financial assistance provided by the respondent was at least $191,852
    in addition to his child support payments. </p>

    the trial judge did state the only purpose achieved by an award would be
    to redistribute capital from the respondent to the appellant, this observation
    followed her findings that all the reasonable material needs of the children
    were met and they did not suffer from a lack of financial support, that the
    appellant did not incur debt or encroach on her capital to meet the children’s
    needs, and that an award in the amount sought would cause an unfair burden
    for the respondent and impair his ability to meet his ongoing support obligations.</p>

    considerations together with the five and a half year delay in bringing the
    application, which the trial judge did not find was excused, formed the basis
    of her decision to deny the appellant’s application.  I see no reason to
    interfere.</p>
