style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant, Jarious Jackson, and the respondent, Monika Graczyk, are the parents
    of a little boy named Jailen, now two and a half years old.  His parents
    have never lived together.  Since his birth Ms. Graczyk has been Jailen’s
    sole custodial parent.</p>

    Miami,

    Florida.  Although Ms. Graczyk had lived in the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
    for several years, she had been ordered to be deported.  In January 2005,
    when Jailen was two and a half months old, she moved with him from
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida to
    <st1:place w:st="on">

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Jackson then started proceedings in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Texas, where he lived, for joint custody of Jailen.  He also brought an application
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario under the <i>Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child
    Abduction</i>, 25 October 1980, Can. T.S. 1983, No. 35 (“Hague Convention” or “Convention”).  He
    asked that Jailen be returned either to
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida or to
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Texas.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Hague Convention aims to prevent international child abduction and ordinarily
    to require that custody rights to children be resolved by the courts of the
    child’s habitual residence.  Mr. Jackson contended that
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Florida was Jailen’s habitual residence and that his mother had wrongfully
    removed him from that jurisdiction.  </p>

    J., who is a very experienced family law judge, dismissed Mr. Jackson’s application.  Mr.
    Jackson appeals that dismissal to this court.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Czutrin
    J. made three critical findings of fact:</p>
  <p class=MsoList4><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Immediately
    before the respondent mother, Ms. Graczyk, moved with Jailen to
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    Ontario, Jailen was not habitually resident in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida.</p>
  <p class=MsoList4><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>ii)<span

    time Ms. Graczyk moved to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, the appellant father, Mr. Jackson, was not actually exercising custody
    rights; instead, he was merely exercising visitation rights to Jailen.</p>
  <p class=MsoList4><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Jackson later acquiesced
    to Jailen’s removal to

    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    succeed on this appeal, Mr. Jackson must show that each of these findings
    was infected by palpable and overriding error.  He cannot do so.  Indeed,
    in my view, each of these findings is supported by the record before the
    application judge.  I would therefore defer to them and dismiss the appeal.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge found against Mr. Jackson on all three matters: habitual
    residence, actual exercise of custody rights, and later acquiescence.  Before
    examining his findings, I will briefly set out the provisions of the Hague
    Convention that specify these three matters.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    first matter – habitual residence – is a cornerstone of the Hague Convention.  Article
    4 provides that the Convention applies “to any child who was habitually resident
    in a
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Contracting
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    State” immediately before any breach of custody rights.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Hague Convention’s underlying rationale is that disputes over custody of
    a child should be resolved by the courts in the jurisdiction where the child
    is habitually resident; child abduction is to be deterred.  The Convention
    presumes that the interests of children who have been wrongfully removed
    are ordinarily better served by immediately returning them to the place of
    their habitual residence where the question of their custody should have
    been determined before their removal.  See <i>V.W. v. D.S.</i>, [1996] 2
    S.C.R. 108 at para. 36.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    rationale for the Convention is enshrined in Article 3(a):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The removal or the retention of a child is to be
    considered wrongful where:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(a)       it is in breach of rights of custody
    attributed to a person, an institution or any other body, either jointly
    or alone, under the law of the State in which the child was habitually resident
    immediately before the removal or retention; and </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second matter – actual exercise of custody rights – is found in Article 3(b):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(b)       at the time of removal or retention
    those rights were actually exercised, either jointly or alone, or would have
    been so exercised but for the removal or retention.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    third matter – subsequent acquiescence – is found in Article 13(a):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Despite the provisions of the preceding Article,
    the judicial or administrative authority of the requested State is not bound
    to order the return of the child if the person, institution or other body
    which opposes its return establishes that:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(a)       the person, institution or other body
    having the care of the person of the child was not actually exercising the
    custody rights at the time of removal or retention, or had consented to or
    subsequently acquiesced in the removal or retention;<span

  <h2>D.        ANALYSIS</h2>
  <h2>1.         Did the application judge err in finding that

style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Under
    the Convention, “habitual residence” is the sole connecting factor triggering
    a child’s return.  The Convention does not define this term.  Instead, the
    definition is found in the case law.  In <i>Korutowska-Wooff v. Wooff</i> (2004),
    242 D.L.R. (4th) 385 at para. 8 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), Feldman J.A. set out the principles for determining “habitual residence”:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet5 style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The

style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A “settled
    intention” is an intention to stay in a place, temporarily or permanently,
    for a particular purpose, such as employment or family; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet5 style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A

style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    finding that “
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Florida is not the child’s habitual residence” the application judge held,
    at para. 56, “that by default …
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario has to be the child’s habitual residence.”  Mr. Jackson submits that
    the application judge erred in law by determining habitual residence by default.  He
    argues that
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Florida must have been the child’s habitual residence because Jailen had
    never lived anywhere else.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    seems to me, however, that the focus should not be on the application judge’s
    assignment of habitual residence by default, nor should it be on where Jailen
    was living immediately before he and his mother moved to
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario.  Instead, the focus should be on the application judge’s finding
    that
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Florida was not the child’s habitual residence.  Unless that latter finding
    is palpably and overridingly wrong or unreasonable, we should not order that
    Jailen be returned to
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    Florida.  See <i>H.L. v.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    paras. 55, 75 and 81 of his reasons, the application judge applied the proper
    principles for determining habitual residence.  He concluded that “there
    is doubt that the child was habitually resident in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Florida”.  In so concluding, he expressly and correctly found that Jailen’s
    habitual residence was tied to that of his mother.  He expressly considered
    the two key principles for determining habitual residence: appreciable period
    of time and settled intention.  He found that:</p>

    and overriding error.  Far from it.  This finding is fully supported by the
    record and is entitled to deference from this court.  See <i>Katsigiannis
    v. Kottick-Katsigiannis</i> (2001), 55 O.R. (3d) 456 at paras. 30-31 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    ).  This finding means that ordering Jailen to return to
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Florida is inconsistent with the underlying aim of the Hague Convention.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge’s conclusion that
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario was Jailen’s habitual residence makes practical sense and is consistent
    with Ms. Graczyk’s settled intention.  What may be said against it is the
    point made by Mr. Jackson: Jailen had only ever lived in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    Florida and had never set foot in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    what underlies the application judge’s conclusion is his assumption that
    Jailen must have had a habitual residence.  As it was not
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    Florida, it must be
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario.  In substance, Mr. Jackson makes the same assumption and argues
    for the opposite conclusion.  As Jailen had never lived anywhere else, his
    habitual residence must be
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Florida.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>But
    there is another way to look at the question of Jailen’s habitual residence:
    immediately before he moved with his mother from
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario, he had no habitual residence.  This approach is consistent with
    the application judge’s finding that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida was not Jailen’s habitual residence, and is supported both by principle
    and authority.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    purpose of the habitual residence requirement under the Convention is to
    ensure that children have some connection – “some strong and readily perceptible
    link” – to the jurisdiction to which they are being returned.  See Paul R.
    Beaumont and Peter E. McEleavy, <i>The Hague Convention on International
    Child Abduction</i> (Toronto: Oxford University Press, 1999) at 101.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Convention, however, does not say that a child must always have a habitual
    residence.  Indeed, the child may have no connection, no readily perceptible
    link, to any jurisdiction.  If that is the case, the Convention will not
    apply.  In the light of the purpose of the habitual residence requirement
    this is not an
    “undesirable lacuna”, but a sensible and unavoidable result.  In their text,
    Beaumont and McEleavy explain why this is so, at p. 90:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>While for choice of law purposes, and perhaps as
    a general ground of jurisdiction, it is important that an individual should
    always have a habitual residence, it is submitted that this is not necessarily
    the case for a child in the context of the Hague Child Abduction Convention.  Where
    a child has no habitual residence the Convention will not apply, but this
    should not immediately be regarded as an undesirable lacuna.  If a child
    does not have a factual connection to a State and knows nothing of it socially,
    culturally, and linguistically, there will be little benefit in sending him
    there. [Footnote omitted.]</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>See also <i>Re J. (A Minor) (Abduction:
      Custody Rights)</i>, [1990] 2 A.C. 562 at 578-9 (H.L.).</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Admittedly,
    cases where a child has no habitual residence will be rare.  Courts should
    not strain to find a lack of habitual residence because that finding would
    deprive a child of the protection of the Convention.  In my view, however,
    Jailen’s situation is that rare case.  Ordering him to return to
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Florida produces a result that is both unjust and at odds with the aim of
    the Convention.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would therefore uphold the application judge’s finding that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida was not Jailen’s habitual residence.  Even accepting Mr. Jackson’s
    submission that the application judge erred in deciding Jailen’s habitual
    residence by default, I would simply hold that the Convention does not apply
    because Jailen was not habitually resident in a “
    <st1:place

    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Contracting
    <st1:PlaceType

  <h2>2.         Did the application judge err in finding that at the time Jailen
    moved to Ontario, Mr. Jackson was not actually exercising custody rights?</h2>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Hague Convention draws a distinction between rights of custody and rights
    of access.  Article 5 sets out this distinction:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>For the purpose of this Convention:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(a)       ‘rights of custody’ shall include
    rights relating to the care of the person of the child and, in particular,
    the right to determine the child’s place of residence;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(b)       ‘rights of access’ shall include the
    right to take a child for a limited period of time to a place other than
    the child’s habitual residence.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Under
    Article 3(b) a child’s removal from his or her habitual residence to another
    jurisdiction is wrongful only if the parent seeking the child’s return has
    actually exercised rights of custody.  Exercise in the context of Article
    3(b) “must be construed widely as meaning that the custodial parent must
    be maintaining the stance and attitude of such a parent”.  See <i>Re H</i>., <i>Re
    S.</i> <i>(Minors) (Abduction: Custody Rights)</i>, [1991] 2 A.C. 476 at

style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge expressly found that at the time Jailen went to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, Mr. Jackson was exercising “visitation” or access rights, not custody
    rights:  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[78] The father was exercising visitation [<i>sic</i>]
    in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida (not custodial rights), but was residing in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Texas and working in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[82] In the circumstances, I find that I am satisfied
    that the child’s habitual residence is tied to the mother’s habitual residence
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  If I am wrong, however, I am also satisfied that the father was not exercising
    his custodial rights nor was he seeking to exercise any rights apart from
    being able to see the child either in Canada or in the United States as evidenced
    by his application filed in Texas.  The father in fact seeks the child’s
    residence to be both in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Texas and
    <st1:place

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    arguing to set aside that finding, Mr. Jackson points to the decision of
    the United States Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in <i>Friedrich v. Friedrich</i>,
    78 F.3d 1060 (1996), which establishes a low threshold for the actual exercise
    of custody rights, to his spending time with Jailen in Florida, and to his
    retaining a lawyer to negotiate a joint custody arrangement for the child.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, these considerations do not establish that the application judge
    made a palpable and overriding error in finding that Mr. Jackson was not
    actually exercising custody rights.  The application judge was aware of the
    decision in <i>Friedrich</i>.  He discussed it in his reasons, at para. 68,
    and acknowledged its “broad and liberal” definition of the word “exercise”
    under the Convention.  He also referred to Mr. Jackson having spent time
    with Jailen in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Florida and to his having retained a lawyer to negotiate a custody arrangement.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Merely
    because some evidence points against an application judge’s finding does
    not by itself make that finding unreasonable or palpably and overridingly
    wrong.  In virtually every case there will be evidence before the trier of
    fact both for and against each party’s position.  Here, the application judge
    considered the competing evidence and made a finding contrary to Mr. Jackson’s
    contention.  An appellate court is required to accept that finding absent
    a palpable and overriding error.  See <i>Waxman v. Waxman</i> (2004), 44
    B.L.R. (3d) 165 at paras. 310ff (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  In my view, the application judge made no such error.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Indeed,
    there is a considerable amount of evidence supporting the application judge’s
    finding that at the time of Jailen’s removal, Mr. Jackson was not actually
    exercising custody rights:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet5 style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.

    Florida for just over a month between late October and the end of November,
    and for a further week in December 2004.  While there, he was never alone
    with Jailen and rarely assisted in his care.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet5 style='text-align:justify;'><span

  <p class=MsoListBullet5 style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    Ms. Graczyk frequently told Mr. Jackson that she needed financial assistance,
    he refused to support her and the child (except for the payment of the December
    rent).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    this evidence it was entirely reasonable for the application judge to find
    that Mr. Jackson was not actually exercising custody rights.  Although he
    visited Jailen in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida and was present for his birth, he was not actually involved in Jailen’s
    life in a way that demonstrated the “stance and attitude” of a parent.  Instead
    of caring for his newborn son, he chose to go out socializing with friends
    and to take two trips out of town.  Although the threshold for demonstrating
    actual exercise of custody rights is low, the application judge did not err
    in finding that Mr. Jackson was not exercising these rights.  On this basis,
    too, Mr. Jackson’s appeal must fail.</p>
  <h2>3.         Did the application judge err in finding that Mr. Jackson later

    if Mr. Jackson were successful in establishing that Florida was Jailen’s
    habitual residence and that he had actually exercised custody rights, under
    Article 13(a) of the Convention the court need not order the child’s return
    if Ms. Graczyk demonstrates that Mr. Jackson “subsequently acquiesced” to
    Jailen’s removal to Ontario.  </p>

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[81] I am satisfied in the circumstances that:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(iii) The father has, in his Texas application,
    sought residence of the child in Texas and Canada and has, at least, acquiesced
    that the mother, in my view, have primary residence of the child.  There
    is nothing to suggest that he would be denied any ability to exercise any
    or all custodial rights in Canada or that his custodial rights in any way
    would be diminished by having the determination of best interests in Canada.</p>

    standard for finding acquiescence is high.  “Clear and cogent” evidence of
    “unequivocal acquiescence” is required.  See <i>Katsigiannis</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at para. 49.   Ordinarily the test for acquiescence is subjective, but as
    Lord Brown-Wilkinson said in <i>Re H</i>. <i>and Others (Minors) (Abduction:
    Acquiescence)</i>, [1998] A.C. 72 at 90 (H.L.):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Where the words or actions of the wronged parent
    clearly and unequivocally show and have led the other parent to believe that
    the wronged parent is not asserting or going to assert his right to the summary
    return of the child and are inconsistent with such return, justice requires
    that the wronged parent be held to have acquiesced.</p>

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
