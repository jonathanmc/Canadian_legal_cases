    aside the order of Justice Charles T. Hackland dismissing their application
    to quash a City by-law restricting the operations of their establishments.  At
    the root of their complaints are provisions prohibiting touching between
    dancers and customers and, more particularly, requiring that all live entertainment
    or services be performed in open designated entertainment areas.  This has
    significant consequences for the pursuit known as “lapdancing” which is said
    to be very important for the profitability of their entertainment parlours.</p>

    <st1:City

    the course of preparing a new draft licensing by-law respecting such establishments,
    City staff consulted with interested stakeholders – including the appellants – and
    studied best practices in other municipalities such as
    <st1:City w:st="on">

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Mississauga and
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Windsor.  On August 25, 2004, City of Ottawa By-law 2004-353 respecting the
    regulating, licensing and governing of adult entertainment parlours (the “AEP
    By-law”) was enacted.  It became effective on November 1, 2004.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    stated purpose of the AEP By-law is captured in the preamble, which states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>AND WHEREAS
    City Council at its meeting of June 23rd, 2004 determined that it is appropriate
    to license adult entertainment owners and adult entertainment operators for
    the purposes of health and safety and consumer protection in order to provide
    a safe environment for patrons and employees[.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:
normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under
    the AEP By-law, all adult entertainment parlours are required to establish
    designated entertainment areas where all live entertainment or services are
    to be performed so as to improve the security for performers and patrons
    by ensuring that all entertainment takes place out in the open.  Touching
    is prohibited.  Adult entertainment owners and operators are not to permit
    performers “providing live entertainment or services designed to appeal to
    exotic or sexual appetites or inclinations to touch or be touched by or have
    physical contact with any person in any manner whatsoever involving any part
    of that person’s body”. </p>

line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    designated entertainment area is a new provision to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Ottawa.  Although the old City by-law prohibited touching between dancers
    and customers, the prohibition was rarely enforced because lap dancing was
    carried out in private rooms or curtained areas –
    referred to as “VIP” or “champagne” rooms.  This allowed owners and managers
    of the adult entertainment parlours to take the position that they did not
    knowingly permit lap dancing or whatever touching may have occurred.  The
    institution of the designated entertainment area – or, to put it another
    way, the elimination of the VIP and champagne rooms – is the central practical
    effect of the AEP By-law from the perspective of the appellants.  Its negative
    impact on their businesses is said to be considerable.</p>

    January 2005, the appellants moved to quash the AEP By-law and for other

    2004, and notice of that meeting was sent out, they say that the notice made
    no reference to health and safety or consumer protection concerns and that
    the overall consultation with industry stakeholders was insufficient.  In
    addition, they complain that the City improperly consulted with the Dancers’ Equal
    Rights Association (“D.E.R.A.”), a group they state was small and not representative
    of dancers in their establishments.  In short, the appellants complain that
    there were no meaningful good-faith discussions with industry stakeholders.</p>

    7.  At the public consultation meeting held on June 10, two of the appellant
    club owners were in attendance and offered comments; dancers were also present.  Indeed,
    as a result of objections from the owners and from D.E.R.A. and the dancers,
    the proposed by-law was amended to remove a requirement that dancers be licensed
    (the owners said they kept a record of the names and addresses of all employees
    and would be willing to disclose the record to police, thus avoiding the
    need for such licensing).  D.E.R.A. had held an open house for dancers in
    early May and circulated relevant information.  Finally, representatives
    of the appellants and their legal counsel were present at the council meeting
    on August 25, 2004, when the AEP By-law was passed.  In spite of the foregoing,

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the appellants submit that the AEP By-law fails to adequately explain the
    reasons why the municipality is licensing and imposing conditions upon the
    adult entertainment industry and how those reasons relate to the subsection
    150(2) purposes.  This submission is without merit.  As the preamble makes
    clear, the City’s reason for licensing adult entertainment owners and operators
    is to promote health and safety and consumer protection in order to provide
    a safe environment for patrons and employees.  The link with subsection 150(2)
    is obvious: a municipality may license business for purposes of health and
    safety and consumer protection.  A reading of the AEP By-law as a whole confirms
    that its provisions respond to these purposes.  Moreover, the application
    judge specifically rejected the argument that the City acted in bad faith
    or for an ulterior purpose, finding there was “simply no evidence to sustain
    the argument that there was an ulterior motive in passing the AEP By-law”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly,
    the appellants argue that the AEP By-law was enacted for a purpose other
    than that for which it purported to be enacted, and therefore that it is <i>ultra
    vires</i> the powers of the municipality.  This submission is also met by
    the application judge’s finding that the City did not act in bad faith or
    for an ulterior purpose, a finding that cannot be interfered with on this
    record.  In addition, this Court has already determined that a by-law with
    essentially the same provisions was a valid exercise of municipal regulatory
    authority: see <i>Ontario Adult Entertainment Bar Assn. v. Metropolitan
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto (Municipality)</i> (1995), 26 O.R. (3d) 257 (

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  I shall refer to this decision as “the Toronto AEP By-law case” in these
    reasons, and return to this latter point later when dealing with the colourability
    issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Aligned
    with the foregoing argument is a third submission, namely, that the AEP By-law
    seeks to prohibit the appellants’
    businesses rather than to regulate them.  I would not give effect to this
    contention either.  A similar contention, in relation to a similar by-law,
    has already been rejected in the Toronto AEP By-law case.  As the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court pointed out in that decision (at 268), “[r]egulation usually
    involves some form of prohibition”, but “[w]hat the municipality may not
    do – either directly or indirectly – is to prohibit adult entertainment parlours
    as such.”  The AEP By-law does not do that.  It prohibits all touching in
    relation to the provision of “services”, <i>i.e.</i>, during exotic dancing,
    and requires that all live entertainment and services be provided in unobstructed
    designated entertainment areas.  However, physical contact between performers
    and clients in a private setting is not essential to the operation of an
    adult entertainment parlour.  The appellants are free to carry on their core
    activities of providing entertainment through stage shows, table dancing,
    and the sale of food and alcoholic beverages.  Indeed, the nine adult entertainment
    parlours that were parties to this proceeding were all preserved under the
    AEP By-law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the Divisional Court observed in the Toronto AEP By-law case, at 268:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    entertainment parlour.  Other than prohibiting touching and physical contact,[<a

    on what an attendant may do while performing services. … In our opinion the
    impugned by-law does nothing more than regulate the manner in which activities
    and other services may be provided in an adult entertainment parlour.  The
    by-law cannot be struck down on the ground that it prohibits rather than
    regulates.</p>

    the appellants contend that the AEP By-law was enacted without a proper factual
    foundation to support the health and safety and consumer protection rationales
    set out in subsection 150(2).  They say there was “a lack of reliable evidence” regarding
    any consultation between the City by-law officials and the City Department
    of Health, that the Department of Health had done no specific study on the
    adult entertainment industry in Ottawa, and that there was expert evidence
    to the effect that lap dancing did not result in the transmission of infectious
    diseases.  The City had received no complaints from dancers that they feared
    for their health or safety and there are few reported incidents of assaults
    on dancers, although the police believe that such a risk exists.</p>

line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again,
    however, the application judge made findings against the appellants on this
    issue.  He considered the foregoing evidence, but noted that there were other
    factors to be considered as well.  For instance, the City Department of Health
    had been concerned for some years about health risks to dancers, and had
    promoted a vaccination program and distributed a “risky business” flyer in
    2000.  It had collected reports and studies suggesting that lap dancing posed
    a risk to those involved.  The City’s public health nurse had been involved
    in the consultation process respecting the drafting of the AEP By-law, and
    the City had reports from police, dancers and by-law officers expressing
    concerns relating to public health and safety in connection with lap dancing.  City
    Council had an extensive Committee Report before it – addressing all of these
    health and safety and consumer protection concerns – when it enacted the
    AEP By-law and it
    “considered the reasonableness of these concerns and voted unanimously in
    favour of the ‘designated area’ requirement and the new AEP By-law as a whole.”</p>

    was not conclusively established and is somewhat “impressionistic”, the concerns

    key to unravelling the appellants’ submission in this regard is found in
    the definitions of “designated entertainment area” and
    “unobstructed” in s. 1 of the AEP By-law:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>“designated entertainment area” means the area, approved by

    the requirement for approval of a detailed floor plan is considered in the
    context of those provisions it is clear that the Chief License Inspector
    and the Chief of Police do not have an unbridled discretion to approve or
    not to approve the issuance of a license to an adult entertainment parlour
    owner at their whim on a case-by-case basis and without regard to any standards.  The
    approval or non-approval of the floor plan will be measured against the benchmark
    criteria of where a designated entertainment area is to be situated – namely,
    in a location that offers “a clear and unobstructed view to entrances, disc
    jockey area, bar and other public areas”.  These criteria mesh with the floor
    plan details called for in s. 4(1) of Schedule 11.  In substance, what the
    By-law gives to the Chief License Inspector and the Chief of Police is simply
    the ability to ensure site line compliance with the objectives of the designated
    entertainment area concept.  As the report that was before council when the
    AEP By-law was enacted proposed:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It is also recommended

    first argument – that there is discrimination as between license holders
    who are members of the same class – is premised on the submission, rejected
    above, that the AEP By-law impermissibly delegates a discretion to the Chief
    License Inspector and the Chief of Police respecting the approval of floor
    plans and the “designated entertainment area”.  For the reasons articulated
    earlier, the By-law does not do so, and this argument therefore cannot succeed.</p>

line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit further, however, that the by-law permits discrimination
    as between adult entertainment parlour operators (who have to be licensed)
    and performers (who do not).  As noted earlier, the licensing of performers
    is a proposal that was dropped during the consultation phase at the request
    of the dancers and at least partially on the representation of various owners
    that licensing performers was unnecessary because they kept records of the
    names and addresses of all performers and would make them available to enforcement
    officials on request, thus precluding the need to license performers.  This
    is some indication that the different treatment of operators and performers
    was not considered significant by the appellants at the time.</p>

line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, this argument must fail as well, in my opinion, because operators
    and performers do not fall within the same class.  They do not “share membership
    in [a] sub-group [of employees within a particular trade or occupation] based
    on working conditions or an employment-related characteristic”: <i>Silvers
    Lounge</i>, <i>supra</i> at para. 33.  Operators perform managerial functions.  Indeed,
    the AEP By-law requires that either a licensed owner or licensed operator
    be on the premises at all time when they are open.  Performers are employees
    only – or, perhaps, independent contractors –
    and their role in the operation of the adult entertainment parlour is quite
    different from that of a licensed operator.</p>

    (a) because there is a potential for arbitrariness and discrimination with
    respect to enforcement decisions and in the approval process for the designated
    entertainment areas, (b) because the “no touching” provision is overly broad
    and open to abuse, and (c) because the by-law provisions are prohibitory
    rather than regulatory and are designed to put the appellants out of business.  For
    the reasons outlined earlier in these reasons, there is no merit in these

    law is too vague where it “does not provide an adequate basis for legal debate” and “does
    not sufficiently delineate any area of risk, and thus can provide neither
    fair notice to the citizen nor a limitation of enforcement discretion”: <i>R.
    v. Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 606 at 639.  Language
    is not an exact tool, however, and a law cannot be expected to predict the
    legal consequences of all possible courses of conduct.  As Gonthier J. noted
    in that case, “[w]hat becomes more problematic is not so much general terms
    conferring broad discretion, but terms failing to give direction as to how
    to exercise this discretion, so that this exercise may be controlled” (at
    612).  A law is unconstitutionally vague if it cannot, even with judicial
    interpretation, give meaningful standards of conduct.  See also, <i>Reference

    addition, the vagueness argument based on the rule of law does not assist
    the appellants in this case.  As the Supreme Court observed in <i>British
    Columbia v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd.</i>, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 473 at paras.
    59 and 60:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[I]t is difficult

    terms of legislation. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>This does not
    mean that the rule of law as described by this Court has no normative force.  As
    McLachlin C.J. stated in <i>Babcock</i>, at para. 54, “unwritten constitutional

    actions”. … But the government action constrained by the rule of law
    … is, by definition, usually that of the executive and judicial branches.  Actions
    of the legislative branch are constrained too, but only in the sense that

    this Court in the Toronto AEP By-law case, where the no touching provision
    was virtually identical to the provision here.  In that case Finlayson J.A.
    was prepared to assume, without deciding – given the tendency of courts to
    take an expansive view in approaching the characterization of conduct as
    expression –
    that lap dancing constitutes a form of expression protected by s. 2(b), “even
    if only marginally so” (at 176).  However, he concluded, as had the

    am I persuaded that the restrictions in s. 18 of the AEP By-law with respect
    to the placing and contents of signs and advertising devices are unenforceable
    on <i>Charter </i>grounds.  Nothing more needs to be said than to cite the
    careful and succinct reasons of the application judge in this regard, which
    I adopt:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left;
'>28.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Municipalities
    have general powers under section 99 and specific powers under section 151
    of the <i>Municipal Act</i>, <i>2001</i>, S.O. 2001, c. 25, to prohibit and
    regulate the message, content and nature of signs, advertising and advertising
    devices.  The AEP By-law does not prohibit adult entertainment owners or
    operators from erecting signs or using other advertising devices on premises
    occupied by an adult entertainment parlour.  The By-law permits owners and
    operators to inform potential customers of the activities of the establishment
    by the use of the words “adult entertainment parlour”.  Prohibited is the
    use of words such as nude, naked, topless, bottomless, sexy or any other
    pictures or symbols having similar meaning.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    in the recent decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <i>Ontario</i><i> (Minister of Transportation) v. Miracle</i> (2005), 74
    O.R. (3d) 161, the prohibition does not catch expression of opinion, but
    simply deals with a business advertisement.  Even if it can be argued that
    section 151 of the <i>Municipal Act</i> may constitute or authorize a limit
    on freedom of expression, and thus infringe section 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i>,
    the provision can be saved pursuant to section 1 of the <i>Charter</i> in
    that recognizing community standards of tolerance as this By-law attempts
    to do, is a sufficiently important objective to justify limiting a <i>Charter </i>right.  The
    signage restriction is rationally connected to that objective and impairs
    the right no more than is necessary to accomplish its objective and does
    not have a disproportionately severe effect on the adult entertainment parlour
    owners.  Indeed, the report which was provided to City council prior to passage
    of the By-law, specifically attributes to one of the applicant club owners
    the representation that the restriction on signage is not objected to by
    the club owners.  These provisions were a part of the previous

    to the submission of the appellants, there was ample evidence before the
    application judge to support his conclusion on the s. 1 analysis.  There
    was evidence from the Director of By-law Services for the City of Ottawa,
    Susan Jones, that limiting the content of adult entertainment parlour signs
    was in the public interest as the signs are in public places where children
    as well as adults will see them; that community tolerance in Ottawa is such
    that words like nude, naked, topless, bottomless, sexy and other words or
    pictures or symbols of like meaning are not considered an acceptable standard;
    and that the AEP By-law represents a rational attempt to strike an appropriate
    balance between the right of businesses to identify themselves and convey
    messages and respect for community standards of tolerance.  This evidence
    buttresses both the pressing and substantial objective and rational connection
    criteria called for in <i>R v. Oakes</i>, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, as part of
    the s. 1 analysis.  The fact that there is no blanket prohibition against
    the display of signs and advertising devices – owners and operators can still
    put up signs stating their business as adult entertainment parlours – supports
    the minimal impairment and proportionality criteria, as does the fact that
    the signage requirements received no negative comments from the appellants
    during the consultation process.</p>

    appellants also impugn on s. 2(b) grounds the requirement of s. 24 of Schedule
    11 of the by-law that notices be posted in various places in the adult entertainment
    establishments advising (a) that physical contact is prohibited, and (b)
    that sexually transmitted infections can be transmitted through unprotected
    physical contact.  They say that forced expression is as much an infringement
    on their freedom of expression as is the regulation or prohibition of expression: <i>Lavigne

    24 of the AEP By-law does not run afoul of s. 2(b) in my view, however.  To
    adopt the words of Wilson J. in <i>Lavigne</i> (at 267), the City’s purpose
    in enacting the notice provision was not “to put a particular message into
    the mouth of the [appellants]<span lang=EN-US>”</span>; rather, it was to
    promote the more general purposes of the by-law, namely, the health and safety
    of the public and consumer protection.  Nor is the effect of the by-law to
    infringe the appellants’ right to freedom of expression.  To quote <i>Lavigne</i> at
    279-80:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='

    from posting their own message in conjunction with the s. 24 message disavowing

    if there were, however – as Mr. Rankin submits on behalf of the City – the
    provision can be saved under s. 1.  The objectives of the notice (protecting
    the health and safety of the public and consumer protection) are pressing
    and substantial, and the posting of the notice is rationally connected to
    that objective (the public is informed of what is prohibited and how sexually
    transmitted infections can be spread).  For the reasons stated above, the
    notices minimally impair the rights of the appellant and any harmful effects
    of requiring the appellants to post them are outweighed by the benefits associated
    with public notification (increased public awareness and improved public
    health and safety and consumer protection).  The provisions of the By-law
    therefore meet the proportionality test.</p>

    a reasonable expectation of privacy and questions of search and seizure.  Here,
    the appellants established no evidentiary record to provide that context.  Claimants
    must provide a factual basis for their claims, not a basis founded on hypothesis: <i>Danson
    v. Ontario (A.G.)</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1086 at 1101.  As the application
    judge noted, the appellants will be free to raise these issues in the appropriate

    of the common law methodology”: <i>Danson</i>, <i>ibid</i>.</p>

    Toronto to enact criminal law legislation in the area of morality, something
    a municipality has no constitutional authority to do.  Here, the appellants
    take a different approach: they submit the AEP By-law is a colourable attempt
    on the part of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ottawa to govern matters already covered in other provincial regulatory statutes,
    namely, the <i>Liquor Licence Act</i> and the <i>Health Protection and Promotion

    to drive adult entertainment establishments out of business.</p>

    colourability doctrine applies to prevent Parliament or a provincial legislature
    from doing indirectly what it is precluded from doing directly by reason
    of the constitutional division of powers.  Here, there is no conflict between
    federal or provincial legislation.  A municipality may not legislate in an
    area already occupied by the province, however, and a by-law will be ineffective
    in such circumstances if it cannot pass the “impossibility of dual compliance” test
    laid down in <i>Multiple Access Ltd. v. McCutcheon</i>, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 161.  That
    is, the by-law will not be invalid unless there is actual conflict between
    the by-law and the provincial legislation such that compliance with one will
    constitute defiance of the other.  The appellants’ argument on this point
    falls more into this latter category.</p>

    the mere existence of provincial legislation in a given field does not oust
    the powers of a municipality to regulate a subject matter.  Where there is
    no barrier to dual compliance, the by-law will stand.  See <i>Spraytech,
    supra,</i> at para. 39.  The appellants were not able to point to any specific
    ways in which they allege the AEP By-law actually conflicts with the licensing
    or regulatory schemes enacted by the province pursuant to either the <i>Liquor
