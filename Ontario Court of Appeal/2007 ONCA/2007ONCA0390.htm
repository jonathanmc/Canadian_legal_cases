    appellants’ pleading is more than 120 pages in length and incorporates 322

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">

    support of her decision to strike the appellants’ pleading, the motion judge,
    in detailed and precise reasons, held that the statement of claim: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(i)    contains pages of irrelevant allegations
    and evidence; </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(ii)   discloses some information that is privileged
    and there-fore inadmissible; </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(iii) discloses some information that violates a
    lawyer’s duty of confidence; and </p>

    with respect to one cause of action as against one respondent, the motion
    judge found, under rule 21.01(1)(b) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>,
    that the statement of claim discloses no reasonable cause of action.  She
    also held that even if the alleged causes of action or some of them exist,
    the statement of claim discloses no reasonable cause of action after the
    offending paragraphs are removed.  In effect, therefore, the motion judge
    found that the numerous causes of action alleged by the appellants, in the
    manner pleaded, failed to disclose any reasonable cause of action.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    agree.  In our opinion, contrary to the rules of pleading established by
    the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, this prolix statement of claim is replete
    with bald and conclusory allegations and evidence.  Yet, notwithstanding
    its length, in many instances it is devoid of those material facts necessary
    to support the causes of action alleged.  In other instances, for the reasons
    set out by the motion judge, the claims advanced are simply not available
    as a matter of law on the facts asserted in the pleading.  On these grounds
    alone, we agree with the motion judge that the challenged statement of claim
    cannot stand.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge also stated in her reasons, at paras. 44 and 45:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>   The plaintiffs submit that the allegations that
    Epp and McLean orchestrated the termination of the retainer to obtain personal
    benefits was contrary to their public duties and akin to or as serious as
    fraud.  If these allegations are true, Manning was required to follow the
    procedure in Rule 2.02 of the <i>Rules of Professional Conduct</i> and inform
    the chief legal officer or council of their alleged dishonest, fraudulent
    or illegal conduct.  If, despite this advice, the alleged mis-conduct continued,
    Manning was obliged to withdraw from acting in the matter.  Instead, he commenced
    an action that is a deliberate and improper collateral attack on his former
    client.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>   Although distinguishable on its facts, I adopt
    the comments of Nordheimer J. in <i>Aviaco International Leasing Inc. v.
    Boeing Canada Inc.</i>, [2000] O.J. No. 2420.  In that case, documents were
    inadvertently faxed to an opposing party and then used by that party on a
    motion resulting in the documents being placed into the public record.  In
    this case, a solicitor, aggrieved by the termination of his retainer and
    in the face of ongoing litigation by his former client, has placed on the
    public record to its detriment, a pleading that discloses no reasonable causes
    of action, pleads privileged communi-cations, discloses confidential information,
    is devoid of material facts, yet alleges serious improprieties.  This is
    unprofessional and an abuse of the process of this court.  I therefore exercise
    my discretion to expunge the claim in its entirety.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Of
    the various grounds of appeal advanced in their factum, the appellants’ oral
    argument before this court was confined essentially to one ground.  In respect
    of the above-quoted comments by the motion judge, they argue that it is incumbent
    on a party asserting privilege to establish an evidentiary basis for the
    privilege claim and that, in this case, there was no factual underpinning
    before the motion judge on which to base a finding of privilege.  The appellants
    say that the quoted observations by the motion judge are the “fulcrum” of
    her decision and that they are flawed because they are based on an assumption – in
    the absence of any evidence from the respondents – that information contained
    in the statement of claim was privileged or confidential.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    reject these submissions for several reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the impugned comments by the motion judge reflect her reasoning for directing
    the expungement of the appellants’ pleading from the public record, in contrast
    to her reasoning for striking the pleading.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    and more importantly, we agree with the motion judge that, on its face, the
    appellants’ pleading contains information that is at least arguably either
    privileged or confidential or both.  The appellants dispute this, asserting
    that: (i) by its subject matter, the applicable information is not privileged
    or confidential; (ii) an established exception to the claim of privilege
    applies in this case; or (iii) the appellants’ former client waived privilege.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    disagree.  The information at issue includes allegations of fact regarding
    the basis for the termination of the appellants’ retainer, the motivation
    for that termination, the nature of advice sought from the appellants by
    representatives of the client (the City of Waterloo), and the content of
    some communications held between those representatives and the appellants.  Relying
    on <i>Desc</i><i><span style='"Times New Roman"'>ô</span>teaux v. Mierzwinski</i>,
    [1982] 1 S.C.R. 860, the appellants argue that only advice given by, as opposed
    to advice sought from, a solicitor is privileged.  <i>Desc</i><i><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>ô</span>teaux</i> does not stand for this proposition,
    which we categorically reject.  To the contrary, in <i>Desc</i><i><span style='"Times New Roman"'>ô</span>teaux</i>,
    the Supreme Court of Canada stressed at pp. 892 – 93: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[A] lawyer’s client is entitled to have all communications
    made with a view to obtaining legal advice kept confidential.  Whether communications
    are made to the lawyer himself or to employees and whether they deal with
    matters of an administrative nature such as financial means or with the actual
    nature of the legal problem, all information which a person must provide
    in order to obtain legal advice which is given in confidence for that purpose
    enjoys the privileges attached to confidentiality.  This privilege applies
    to all communications within the framework of the solicitor-client relationship.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants acknowledge before this court that it was open to the motion judge
    to strike those paragraphs of their pleading that she regarded as containing
    privileged or confidential information unless privilege had been lost by
    client waiver or privilege did not arise due to an applicable legal exception.  Even
    assuming – without deciding – that waiver or an exception to privilege would
    authorize a solicitor to unilaterally place in the public domain information
    that is arguably privileged or confidential, as occurred in this case, the
    appellants’ pleading does not expressly or impliedly allege either waiver
    or an established legal exception to the privilege claim.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    any event, given the nature of the wrongful conduct alleged by the appellants
    to have been committed by the respondents, which is in the nature of fraud
    or intentional tortious impropriety akin to fraud, the appellants were obliged
    to plead such conduct with particularity in accordance with rule 25.06(8)
    of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>.  They failed to do so.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    well, there is nothing on this record to support the appellants’ claim that
    privilege was waived by the City or its authorized representatives.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the end, we see no error in the motion judge’s decision to exercise her discretion
    to both strike the statement of claim in its entirety without leave to amend
    and to direct that it be expunged from the record.  Indeed, we regard her
    decision and her reasoning in support of it as unassailable. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    for the reasons given, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before
    concluding these reasons, there is one further matter upon which we wish
    to comment.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants brought a fresh evidence application in connection with this appeal.  The
    core of the proposed fresh evidence consists of several pieces of correspondence,
    which indicate that Mr. Manning caused his “concerns” – at least about Herb
    Epp’s request that he change his legal opinion – to be conveyed to the chief
    legal officer of the City in compliance with his obligations under Rule 2.02
    of the <i>Rules of Professional Conduct</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    practice in this Court with respect to fresh evidence is well-known: the
    members of the panel read the fresh evidence in advance and frequently, although
    not always, counsel are permitted to argue the appeal on the basis of the
    fresh evidence; the Court then rules on the admissibility of the fresh evidence
    at the time that it disposes of the appeal on the merits.  In accordance
    with this well-established practice in this Court, the panel read the proposed
    fresh evidence tendered by the appellants in advance of the argument of this
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, the appellants did not address their fresh evidence motion at
    the outset of the appeal, nor was any reference made to it, or to the proposed
    fresh evidence, by Mr. Manning during his argument.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the conclusion of Mr. Manning’s argument, we indicated our view that it was
    unnecessary to hear submissions from the respondents or the City.  At that
    point, again, Mr. Manning made no reference to the fresh evidence motion
    or to the proposed evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    panel then dismissed the appeal, for reasons delivered orally as set out
    above.  Only thereafter, when the appeal proceeding had reached the costs
    submissions stage, did Mr. Manning rise to seek to be heard on the appellants’ fresh
    evidence motion, informing the panel for the first time that he understood
    that the motion was to have been dealt with “after the appeal was disposed
    of”.  Despite the unusual nature of this position –
    the fresh evidence was sought to be introduced to buttress the appellants’
    submissions on the appeal – and notwithstanding the unusual nature of Mr.
    Manning’s request – that he be heard on the fresh evidence motion after his
    original submissions were complete and a decision had been rendered by the
    panel – we heard submissions from all counsel with respect to the fresh evidence
    motion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having
    considered those additional submissions, for the following reasons we are
    satisfied that the fresh evidence issue is not dispositive of the outcome
    of this appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    as we have said, the panel was aware of the nature of the fresh evidence
    and had read the appellants’ fresh evidence motion materials, including the
    proposed evidence, in advance of the oral argument of the appeal.  Accordingly,
    the proposed evidence and the fresh evidence motion were taken into account
    by the panel in determining to dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span

    this regard, it is debatable whether the proposed evidence constitutes fresh
    evidence at all.  While two of the letters had not yet been exchanged at
    the time of the motion, Mr. Manning nonetheless made the argument before
    the motion judge that he had reported the respondent Epp’s alleged misconduct
    to the City’s solicitor.  At most, then, the motion judge may have overlooked
    that submission when she made her reference to the <i>Rules of Professional
    Conduct</i> in para. 44 of her reasons.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    and in any event – even if the evidence is fresh evidence and assuming it
    meets the test for admissibility set out in <i>R. v. Palmer</i>, [1980] 1
    S.C.R. 759 – it does not affect our analysis of the merits of the appeal
    or our view of its proper disposition.  Mr. Manning concedes that the fresh
    evidence does not go to the issue of whether the causes of action alleged
    should or should not be struck.  He seeks to rely on it in conjunction with
    his attack on paras. 44 and 45 of the motion judge’s reasons, cited above,
    which he says constitute the heart of her reasons but which, in reality,
    concern him because of their personal references.  It is partly for this
    reason that we agreed to hear the fresh evidence motion in the unusual circumstances
    that we have described, in order that the record will clarify that such evidence
    exists.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    we do not understand the motion judge’s remarks in para. 44 of her reasons
    to be anything other than a response to the respondents’ argument before
    her that there was a procedure available to the appellants if they were concerned
    about the respondents’ conduct, namely resort to the steps set out in Rule
    2.02 of the <i>Rules of Professional Conduct</i>.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    the context of the motion judge’s comments in paras. 44 and 45 make clear
    that her impugned statements played no part in her assessment of whether
    the appellants’ pleading should be struck.  As we have said, they were concerned
    solely with the issue whether the statement of claim, having been struck,
    should be expunged from the public record.  We are satisfied that the central
    reasoning of the motion judge with respect to expunging the statement of
    claim is found in her remarks in para. 45, and that any misapprehension by
    the motion judge about whether Mr. Manning had made his concerns known to
    the City was not material to that decision.</p>
