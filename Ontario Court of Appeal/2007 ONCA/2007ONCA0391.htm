  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiff, Stientje Huisman (known as Esther Huisman), suffered from hip
    dysplasia.  She consulted the defendant, Dr. Steven J. MacDonald, an orthopaedic
    surgeon, concerning this condition.  Dr. MacDonald recommended that she undergo
    a left periacetabular Ganz pelvic osteotomy (“Ganz pelvic osteotomy”) to
    alleviate her symptoms and to delay the need for a hip replacement.  Dr.
    MacDonald believed that the Ganz pelvic osteotomy afforded Ms. Huisman her
    best chance to return to her active participation in sports and in particular
    to competitive tennis.  The Ganz pelvic osteotomy is complex surgery which
    in non-technical terms involves restructuring the socket of the hip joint
    (the acetabulum) located in the pelvis in order to provide a better fit for
    the head of the femur (thigh bone).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    MacDonald performed the recommended surgery on Ms. Huisman in June 1999.  Unfortunately,
    during the course of the surgery, she suffered injury to her sciatic nerve
    which resulted in the paralysis of her left foot – commonly referred to as
    foot drop.  Ms. Huisman, her mother and other members of her family sued
    Dr. MacDonald and others for medical malpractice.  The trial judge, Justice
    Lynne Leitch of the Superior Court of Justice, found that the surgery was
    performed competently.  However, she found that the doctor did not properly
    inform Ms. Huisman of the risk of damage to her sciatic nerve and her consequent
    risk of foot drop.  The trial judge concluded that a reasonable person in
    the position of Ms. Huisman would have refused the recommended surgery had
    the risks of permanent nerve damage and its consequences been disclosed to
    her.  The trial judge therefore found Dr. MacDonald liable in damages to
    Ms. Huisman and her mother.  The other family members and the defendants
    other than Dr. MacDonald were dropped from the action before the trial.  </p>

    Huisman suffered from hip dysplasia in both her hips which was diagnosed
    in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Holland at the age of 12.  At that time, she did not suffer significant pain

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    , her problem became symptomatic.  She began to suffer from pain in her hips.  As
    a result, she saw Dr. John Turnbull, an orthopaedic surgeon in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Chatham in December 1997.  Dr. Turnbull recommended against surgery at that

    Ms. Huisman returned to see Dr. Turnbull in December 1998, the condition
    of her left hip had worsened.  Dr. Turnbull referred Ms. Huisman to Dr. MacDonald
    at the

    <st1:PlaceType

    Hospital in

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    MacDonald’s consultation note to Dr. Turnbull reported Ms. Huisman’s history
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Over the last several years she has had a gradual
    progression in her symptoms.  You actually saw her in December of 1997 at
    which point she was doing reasonably well, but over the last year she has
    noticed quite a significant progression in her symptoms.  She is very active
    in various sports such as tennis, badminton, volleyball and basketball.  She
    does sports at least for one and one-half hours per day.  She notices quite
    significant pain afterwards with the hip being stiff and sore particularly
    with the groin.  If she is not as active in sports the pain is better and
    if she does no sports then the pain is significantly improved.  She states,
    however, even with walking after an hour or two in the mall she has increasing
    pain and discomfort in her hip.  She does not have any nocturnal pain, but
    does have difficulty going to sleep.  On top of her chronic pain, she does
    have acute exacerbations with intermittent sharp groin pain.  She is on no
    current medications.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…She does remain quite active in sports, however
    does so at a price.  She has pain after really almost any type of prolonged
    activity including even walking.  She has had quite significant progression
    in her symptoms over this last year and this certainly coincides with her
    radiographic changes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a result of his physical examination and a review of the x-rays of her left
    hip, Dr. MacDonald concluded that Ms. Huisman had significant acetabular
    dysplasia and that there were signs of early arthritis in the hip joint.  In
    a comparison of her 1999 x-rays with 1995 x-rays, he concluded that the cartilage
    space in the joint had been reduced by less than one-half, which he described
    as a very significant change and was an indication of the onset of arthritis.  In
    short, she had a significant problem.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    MacDonald told Ms. Huisman and her mother, who attended the appointment with
    her, that there had been quite a change since the previous year’s check-up
    and that her left hip was showing some serious deterioration.  Dr. MacDonald
    discussed three options to address the problem: do nothing, a femoral osteotomy
    and a pelvic osteotomy.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(i)        Do nothing and wait
      and see</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    Ms. Huisman and her mother recalled that the do nothing option involved waiting
    to see how her hip progressed and that she would have to limit her activities
    when she felt pain in her hip.  Eventually she would require a hip replacement.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(ii)      The femoral osteotomy</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    procedure involved cutting through the femur in order to change the angle
    in which the femur would sit in the socket.  Dr. MacDonald said that he did
    not recommend this procedure because, while it was a good treatment for patients
    who have the majority of changes on the femoral side, Ms. Huisman had the
    majority of her dysplasia on the pelvic side.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(iii)     The Ganz Pelvic Osteotomy</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Huisman recalled that Dr. MacDonald referred to the procedure as a pelvic
    osteotomy without reference to “Ganz”.  She recalls Dr. MacDonald telling
    her that it was a complex procedure which the doctor had learned in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Switzerland</st1:country-region>
    where the procedure was developed.  He told her that the procedure had only
    been available in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    for about 15 years and only two doctors (including Dr. MacDonald) did the
    procedure in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  If everything went well, she should have no pain or reduced pain and if,
    after recovery, she had no pain, she would be able to play competitive tennis
    again.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Huisman recalled that Dr. MacDonald explained that in the area of the surgery,
    there were many arteries, veins and nerves and that this type of surgery
    was riskier than the femoral osteotomy because of the proximity of the nerves
    and arteries.  At that point, Ms. Huisman asked Dr. MacDonald whether he
    ever had any patients who had suffered nerve damage after this surgery.  Dr.
    MacDonald responded that he had not had any patients who had suffered nerve
    damage from this procedure.  Ms. Huisman testified that she “wanted to make
    sure, you know, that the risk was not too high … so from that I was confident
    that there wasn’t, you know, not … not a very high risk for that to happen.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Huisman said that Dr. MacDonald did not tell her that she could suffer nerve
    damage which could result in a foot drop.  Dr. MacDonald did not tell her
    that one of the three cuts that he would make into the pelvis was a blind
    cut.  She asked Dr. MacDonald if he had experience in this kind of surgery
    and he said that he did.  Dr. MacDonald testified that at that point he had
    done 8 to 10 such surgeries.  Ms. Huisman testified that if she had known
    that he had only done 8 to 10 of these procedures, she would have reconsidered
    her decision.  She also testified that if she had been told of the risk of
    irreversible paralysis to her leg she would not have had the surgery.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Huisman’s mother provided generally corroborative evidence of the discussion
    with Dr. MacDonald.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    MacDonald testified that he did not have an independent recollection of his
    discussion with Ms. Huisman and her mother in April 1999 in respect of each
    of the risks involved in the Ganz pelvic osteotomy, although he had a general
    recollection of discussing risks.  He was satisfied that he would have provided
    Ms. Huisman and her mother with a full explanation of the risks, based upon
    his usual practice, which included advising of the risk of damage to the
    sciatic nerve and the consequent serious complication of foot drop.  Dr.
    MacDonald relied upon his consultation note made immediately after the discussion
    with Ms. Huisman and her mother, which stated in part:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The risks of surgery were discussed at great length
    with her including the risks of anaesthesia, infection, DVT, pulmonary embolism,
    failure of the hardware, delayed union, mal-union and non-union, neurovascular
    injury, progression of arthrosis and failure to resolve her symptoms.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    MacDonald testified that in his usual discussion, he would not have used
    the term “neurovascular injury”.  He would discuss the risks of injury to
    the sciatic nerve and the possibility of foot drop.  He would explain that
    most of the time injury to the nerves is not permanent but sometimes it may
    be.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    MacDonald left the room for about five minutes so that Ms. Huisman and her
    mother could have a private discussion.  When the doctor returned, Ms. Huisman
    advised that she wished to proceed with the proposed surgery.  Ms. Huisman
    had previously decided that she would forego the tennis scholarship in order
    to deal with her hip dysplasia.  Ms. Huisman testified that doing nothing
    was not an option.  Ms. Huisman’s mother testified about the decision to
    proceed with the surgery as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Actually, it was not a very, it was not even that
    hard to make a decision, ‘cause Esther wanted to go back to tennis, and he
    made it very clear to us that the only option, that would do that for her,
    would be the pelvic osteotomy.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I think she had a lot of pain almost every day.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    surgery was performed by Dr. MacDonald on June 23, 1999.  After the surgery,
    Ms. Huisman was unable to wiggle the toes of her left foot.  She developed
    a severe left sciatic nerve palsy post-operatively.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    June 26, 1999, Dr. MacDonald performed a second surgery during which he removed
    a bone splinter which had pierced the sciatic nerve.  Unfortunately, the
    problem with Ms. Huisman’s sciatic nerve did not improve significantly.  In
    the years following the surgery, she had difficulty walking.  She was unable
    to resume her tennis career or participate in other sports.  She began to
    suffer stress fractures in her left foot.  Eventually, her left leg was amputated
    below the knee on October 7, 2003, which provided her with considerable relief
    and enabled her to walk much better with a prothesis.</p>

    Western Ontario in the fall of 1999 and eventually graduated four years later
    with a degree in kinesiology.  She has recovered remarkably well from her
    numerous set-backs and, fortunately for her, she has an extremely positive
    outlook on life.  Nevertheless, she continues to experience a significant
    disability and, of course, was unable to return to competitive tennis and

    Wedge was familiar with the Ganz pelvic osteotomy but did not perform it.  However,
    he had no objection to this procedure being employed in Ms. Huisman’s case.  He
    regarded the Ganz procedure as more prone to sciatic nerve injury.  Dr. Wedge
    would have performed a different kind of pelvic osteotomy which he thought
    was suitable for Ms. Huisman’s condition and was less risky.  The particular
    procedure he would have employed was one developed by him at the Hospital
    for Sick Children but had not been published.</p>

    nerve at risk in one way or another.  He testified that in pelvic surgery,
    the sciatic nerve is at risk of temporary palsy at a rate of 1.3% to 9.5%.  The
    risk of permanent nerve damage is at the rate of 0% to 1.4%.</p>

    of hip replacement surgery.  He agreed in cross-examination that peripheral
    nerve lesions in primary total hip replacements are evident at a rate of
    .6% to 1.3%.  Dr. Wedge testified that in a revision of a total hip replacement,
    the rate of nerve injury is up to 7.5%.  In further cross-examination, Dr.
    Wedge estimated that a risk of permanent sciatic nerve injury with total
    hip replacement is around 1% to 2%.  Risk of neuro-vascular injury increases
    with each subsequent revision.  </p>

    hip had for any reasonable, not even competitive, long-term good function
    is with the realignment such as she had.  He further testified that with
    the surgery, her hip would have lasted more than 10 to 20 years and she would
    have been able to participate in some degree of sports activity.  When asked

      THE TRIAL JUDGE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    a careful and detailed review of the evidence, the trial judge concluded
    that it was reasonable for Dr. MacDonald to recommend the Ganz pelvic osteotomy.  She
    also concluded that Dr. MacDonald was not negligent in his conduct of the
    surgery.  She was satisfied that Dr. MacDonald was not negligent in the post-operative
    care or the conduct of the second surgery.  No appeal is taken in respect
    of the aforementioned issues.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect of the issue of informed consent, the trial judge found that Ms.
    Huisman was not properly informed of the consequences of a nerve injury suffered
    during a Ganz pelvic osteotomy.  The trial judge also concluded “as a matter
    of law that a reasonable person in Ms. Huisman’s position would not have
    consented to the surgery if the material information had been disclosed.”  It
    is from the trial judge’s conclusions on informed consent that this appeal
    is taken.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge dealt first with the issues of whether Dr. MacDonald should have
    told Ms. Huisman that he had only performed eight to ten Ganz pelvic osteotomies
    and whether one of the cuts he was to make was not under direct vision.  She
    concluded at paragraphs 197 and 198 of her reasons for judgment as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[197]   Although the evidence is clear that Dr.
    MacDonald did not inform Ms. Huisman that he had only performed 8 to 10 osteotomies
    prior to her surgery and he did not advise her that one of the cuts was not
    made under direct vision, I am satisfied that these omissions are not a breach
    of the duty of disclosure.  It is significant that Ms. Huisman did not ask
    him about the extent of his experience and only asked if he had experience.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[198]   The medical evidence does not establish
    that either of these circumstances are material risks and I agree with counsel
    for the defence that in <i>Hopp v. Lepp</i>, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 192, at least
    inferentially the Supreme Court of Canada concluded that a physician failing
    to inform a patient of the extent of his or her experience is not in and
    of itself a breach of a duty of disclosure.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then turned her mind to whether the risk of nerve damage and
    its consequences and, in particular, whether the risk of permanent paralysis
    to the sciatic nerve and resulting foot drop were material risks.  She concluded
    at paragraphs 208 and 209 of her reasons for judgment as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[208]   Clearly, the risk of sciatic nerve injury
    is a material risk of the surgery Dr. MacDonald recommended to Ms. Huisman.  Dr.
    Garbuz and Dr. MacDonald both agreed that the sciatic nerve was at risk in
    this operation and that one of the consequences of injury to the sciatic
    nerve could be permanent paralysis.  Dr. MacDonald acknowledged that foot
    drop is a major complication of the surgery.  He agreed with the suggestion
    that if he did not tell Ms. Huisman about permanent foot drop then it was
    a failure of omission and he should have told her about that because it is
    a material risk and something that she had to know in order to make an informed
    consent to the operation.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[209]   I am satisfied that the risk of permanent
    sciatic nerve damage is a material, special or unusual risk that a reasonable
    person in Ms. Huisman’s position would want to be informed of in relation
    to this surgery.  The expert medical evidence was clear that sciatic nerve
    damage was a material, special or unusual risk.  The authoritative literature
    referred to by the medical experts relating to the Ganz osteotomy supports
    that conclusion.  Further, the fact that the occurrence of sciatic nerve
    damage may result in serious consequences renders it a material risk.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    concluded that the occurrence of permanent sciatic nerve damage may result
    in serious consequences which renders it a material risk, the trial judge
    addressed the question of whether this information was provided to Ms. Huisman.  In
    particular, she addressed the conflict in the evidence between Dr. MacDonald
    on the one hand and Ms. Huisman and her mother on the other hand.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found Dr. MacDonald’s evidence to be forthright and honest.  At
    paragraph 221 of her reasons, she made the following comments concerning
    his testimony:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[221]   Dr. MacDonald’s testimony was forthright
    and in my view he was an honest witness.  He made no effort to disparage
    the recollection of Ms. Huisman and her mother nor did he make any effort
    to elevate the extent of his recollection of his discussions with Ms. Huisman.  He
    readily acknow-ledged that he did not have an independent recollection of
    their discussions and relied on his usual practice and what he recorded in
    his consultation note.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also found Ms. Huisman to be a forthright witness whose evidence
    was consistent.  The trial judge observed that Ms. Huisman
    “made no effort to minimize the extent to which she was informed about the
    surgery.”  She also found that the evidence of Ms. Huisman’s mother was consistent
    with that of her daughter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge made the point that although Dr. MacDonald’s consultation note
    referred to a discussion with Ms. Huisman of the risk of neurovascular injury,
    such note is not inconsistent with the evidence of Ms. Huisman and her mother.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge preferred the evidence of Ms. Huisman and her mother in respect
    of whether Dr. MacDonald had told them about the risk and consequences of
    nerve injury, at para. 225 of the reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[225]   I find both Ms. Huisman and her mother
    to be credible witnesses with a reliable memory of these events and I accept
    their evidence that Dr. MacDonald did not inform Ms. Huisman of the risk
    of a drop foot.  Ms. Huisman and her mother readily acknowledged that Ms.
    Huisman was infor-med that there was a risk of nerve damage, however, I am
    satisfied that they were not sufficiently informed by Dr. MacDonald to understand
    what the risk was.  By her own evidence, she clearly acknowledged there were
    risks to the nerves involved and she assumed the risks to be low by virtue
    of Dr. MacDonald’s responses to her questions.  Ms. Huisman was not given
    an explanation of the consequences of a nerve injury.  She did not understand
    that a nerve injury could result in permanent injury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, the trial judge found that Dr. MacDonald breached his duty of
    disclosure to Ms. Huisman “because he did not inform Ms. Huisman of a material,
    special or unusual risk that a reasonable person in her position would want
    to know.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then turned to the issue of causation.  In accordance with the
    Supreme Court of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    decisions in <i>Reibl v. Hughes</i>, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 880 and <i>Arndt v.
    Smith</i>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 539, she considered the so-called modified objective
    test –
    whether a reasonable person in Ms. Huisman’s position would have declined
    the recommended surgery if the material information had been disclosed.  If
    the answer is yes, then causation (and therefore liability) is established.  If
    the answer is no, then liability is not established.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    considering the evidence of Ms. Huisman to the effect that she would have
    declined the surgery, the trial judge reviewed the evidence both for and
    against proceeding with the surgery, which included an analysis of the risks
    and benefits of doing nothing as compared to the risks and benefits of the
    Ganz pelvic osteotomy.  Her conclusion on the issue of informed consent is
    contained in the following three paragraphs of her reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[275]   To again use the words of Cory J. in <i>Arndt
      v. Smith</i> in determining whether a reasonable person in Ms. Huisman’s
      position would consent to this surgery, I must take into consideration
      any “particular concerns” of Ms. Huisman that are reasonably based and
      any “special considerations” affecting Ms. Huisman.  I must consider what
      the reasonable patient in the circumstances of Ms. Huisman would have done
      if faced with the same situation.  As Cory J. queried in <i>Arndt v. Smith</i> with
      reference to Laskin C.J.’s reasons in <i>Reibl v. Hughes</i>:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Which aspects of the patient’s personal circumstances
    should be attributed to the reasonable person?  There is no doubt that objectively
    ascertainable circumstances, such as a plaintiff’s age, income, marital status,
    and other factors, should be taken into consider-ation.  However, Laskin
    C.J. did not stop there.  He went on and stated that “special considerations” affecting
    the particular patient should be considered, as should any “specific questions” asked
    of the physician by the patient.  In my view this means that the “reasonable
    person” who sets the standard for the objective test must be taken to possess
    the patient’s reasonable beliefs, fears, desires and expecta-tions.  Further,
    the patient’s expectations and concerns will usually be revealed by the questions
    posed.  Certainly, they will indicate the specific concerns of the particular
    patient at the time consent was given to a proposed course of treatment.  The
    questions, by revealing the patient’s concerns, will provide an indication
    of the patient’s state of mind, which can be relevant in considering and
    applying the mod-ified objective test.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[276] Ms. Huisman was young and had always been
    very active in sports.  Her athletics were very important to her.  Her hip
    was deteriorating and her symptoms were increasing and impacting on her ability
    to pursue athletics and other daily activities.  She was experiencing pain.  She
    was anxious to obtain a resolution of her difficulties.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[277]   In this case, Ms. Huisman’s questions about
    nerve injury are clearly relevant and indicate that she had a special concern
    about nerve damage, which is not unreasonable.  These concerns are related
    to a risk of the surgery, which is low, but which has serious consequences
    that are significant to a reasonable person in Ms. Huisman’s circumstances – that
    is a young, active individual who would obviously be concerned with the risk
    of injury that would impact on her basic mobility.  Without this surgery,
    she did face the certainty of a hip replacement in the future at an age when
    numerous hip revisions would be necessary with increasing and significant
    risk of sciatic nerve injury.  With this surgery she would postpone the need
    for a hip replacement.  This was elective surgery.  There is no question
    that her symptoms from her deteriorating hip were affecting her, but she
    was not yet disabled.  I am satisfied that a reasonable person in Ms. Huisman’s
    circumstances would have refused treatment had the risks of permanent nerve
    damage and its consequences been disclosed to her.</p>

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(i)        Did the trial judge

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for Dr. MacDonald submits that the trial judge erred in the application of
    the modified objective test articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Reibl
    v. Hughes</i> and <i>Arndt v. Smith</i>.  In particular, counsel argues that
    the trial judge erred in seizing on one question that Ms. Huisman asked of
    Dr. MacDonald concerning nerve damage, i.e. whether he ever had any patients
    who had suffered nerve damage after a Ganz pelvic osteotomy.  Counsel for
    Dr. MacDonald submits that this one question is the fulcrum upon which the
    trial judge’s analysis turns.  Counsel’s complaint is that she uses it to “trump” all
    of the other evidence at trial which suggests that a reasonable person, in
    the position of Ms. Huisman, would have proceeded with the surgery.  This
    conclusion, counsel says, flies directly in the face of Ms. Huisman’s unequivocal
    statement that to do nothing was not an option.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    further submits that if one reads the trial judge’s three concluding paragraphs
    on informed consent, that until one gets to the last sentence of the third
    paragraph (para. 277), one is left with the clear impression that the trial
    judge is about to conclude that a reasonable person in Ms. Huisman’s position
    would have proceeded with the surgery.  Counsel observes that there is simply
    no explanation or analysis of why she reaches her conclusion in the face
    of such strong evidence pointing in the other direction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    would appear that the trial judge reached her conclusion on the basis of
    the passage she cites at para. 275 of her reasons, from Cory J. in <i>Arndt
    v. Smith</i> at para. 9.  In that passage, Cory J. observes that in the application
    of the modified objective test, a particular patient’s concerns are often
    revealed by the questions a patient asks of his or her physician.  The trial
    judge concluded that Ms. Huisman’s question about nerve injury indicates
    a special concern about nerve damage.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for Dr. MacDonald argues that the trial judge’s conclusion, without more,
    is unreasonable.  He points out that in <i>Arndt v. Smith</i>, the plaintiff
    asked her physician a very general question concerning the risks associated
    with maternal chicken pox during pregnancy.  In that case, Cory J. observed
    at para. 18 that “[i]n the absence of a specific and clearly expressed concern,
    there was nothing to indicate to the doctor that she had a particular concern
    in this regard.”  Cory J. further observed that
    “[i]t follows that there was nothing disclosed by Mrs. Arndt’s question which
    could be used by the trier of fact as an indication of a particular fear
    regarding the possibility of giving birth to a disabled child which should
    be attributed to the hypothetical reasonable person in the patient’s situation.”  Counsel
    for Dr. MacDonald submits that the trial judge in this case should have ascribed
    to Ms. Huisman’s question concerning the risk of nerve injury “precisely
    the same significance as in <i>Arndt v. Smith</i>.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, counsel for Dr. MacDonald makes a serious case on behalf of his
    client.  On the basis of this record, I may well have been persuaded to find
    in his client’s favour if I had been the trial judge.  However, it is trite
    to say that this is not sufficient.  This raises the question of the appropriate
    standard of appellate review.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    note that in the conclusion of her reasons for judgment, the trial judge
    stated: “I have also found as a <i>matter of law</i> that a reasonable person
    in Ms. Huisman’s position would not have consented to the surgery if the
    material information had been disclosed.” [Emphasis added.]  With respect,
    I disagree with the trial judge’s characterization of the issue as a matter
    of law.  The question decided by the trial judge which is in issue on this
    appeal involves the application of the modified objective test to the facts
    as found by the trial judge, which is a question of mixed fact and law: see <i>Housen
    v. Nikolaisen</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235 at para. 27.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the trial judge correctly articulated the legal test to be applied.  If
    there was error, it was in her factual analysis which resulted in her conclusion
    that a reasonable person in Ms. Huisman’s circumstances would have refused
    treatment had the risks of permanent nerve damage been disclosed to her.  In
    order to reverse the trial judge on that conclusion, the appellant must,
    in my view, establish palpable and overriding error.  I find support for
    this conclusion in the reasons for judgment of Iacobucci and Major JJ. in <i>Housen</i> at
    para. 28:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>However, where the error does not amount to an
    error of law, a higher standard is mandated.  Where the trier of fact has
    considered all the evidence that the law requires him or her to consider
    and still comes to the wrong conclusion, then this amounts to an error of
    mixed law and fact and is subject to a more stringent standard of review:
    [<i>Canada (Director of Investigation and Research) v. Southam Inc.,</i> [1997]
    1 S.C.R. 748] at paras. 41 and 45.  While easy to state, this distinction
    can be difficult in practice because matters of mixed law and fact fall along
    a spectrum of particularity.  </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>In <i>Housen</i>, the court was
    considering the standard of review in respect of a finding of negligence.  Iacobucci

    Taylor</i>, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 2, at p. 4, Dickson J. (as he then was) set aside
    the holding of the British Columbia Court of Appeal that the trial judge
    had erred in his findings of negligence on the basis that “it is wrong for
    an appellate court to set aside a trial judgment where there is not palpable
    and overriding error, and the only point at issue is the interpretation of
    the evidence as a whole” (see also <i>Schreiber Brothers Ltd. v. Currie Products
    Ltd.,</i> [1980] 2 S.C.R. 78, at p. 84).</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>In this case, we are concerned with
    the trial judge’s interpretation of the evidence as a whole as it relates
    to the modified objective test.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    one reads the three paragraphs of the trial judge’s conclusion on informed
    consent in isolation, it is not difficult to support the position advanced
    by counsel for Dr. MacDonald.  In those paragraphs, there is no reference
    to Ms. Huisman’s stated position that to do nothing was not an option.  There
    is no explanation as to why she concludes that the single question asked
    by Ms. Huisman concerning nerve damage “trumps” all of the other evidence
    – particularly the evidence concerning the certainty of a future hip replacement
    and subsequent hip revisions with their attendant and increasing risk of
    nerve damage.  There is no explanation why a young 19 year old woman in the
    position of Ms. Huisman, with her heart set on a competitive tennis career,
    would decline to proceed with corrective surgery which had a relatively low
    risk of nerve damage and a reasonably good chance of returning her to the
    tennis court and an active sporting life.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    to focus only on the three concluding paragraphs of lengthy and detailed
    reasons for judgment is, in my view, too narrow a focus.  In fairness, one
    must consider the entirety of the reasons.  Those reasons exhibit a comprehensive
    appreciation of the relevant evidence and appropriate references are made
    to the relevant legal authorities.  She correctly articulated the modified
    objective test.  Four pages before her concluding paragraphs, the trial judge
    does refer to the evidence that for Ms. Huisman to do nothing was not an
    option.  Throughout her reasons, she refers to the evidence which supports
    the position of Dr. MacDonald to the effect that a reasonable person properly
    informed, in the position of Ms. Huisman, would have proceeded with the surgery.  However,
    except for her limited analysis in the concluding three paragraphs on informed
    consent such evidence is not expressly analyzed in reference to the modified
    objective test.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    would have been preferable if the trial judge had articulated more clearly
    the line of reasoning that led to her conclusion.  However, is the trial
    judge’s conclusion so deficient that one can be satisfied that the reasons
    exhibit palpable and overriding error?  I think not.  The palpable and overriding
    error standard of review is an extremely high standard for any appellant
    to establish.  Iacobucci and Major JJ. in <i>Housen</i>, at para. 5, observed
    that the New Oxford Dictionary of English (1998) described the meaning of
    palpable as
    “clear to the mind or plain to see”: see also <i>H.L. v.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Attorney General)</i>, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401 at para. 69.  A palpable error
    to be overriding must discredit the result: see <i>H.L.</i> at para. 69.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    one reads the reasons for judgment in this case as a whole, I am not satisfied
    that the error articulated by counsel for Dr. MacDonald discredits the result.  Counsel
    for Ms. Huisman points out, for example, that although to do nothing was
    not an option, his client came to that conclusion without the knowledge of
    the risk of permanent nerve damage and the consequence of foot drop.  The
    trial judge was most certainly aware of that fact and I accept that it must
    have entered into the reasoning that led to her conclusion.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(ii)      Are the reasons for

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for Dr. MacDonald supplements his first ground of appeal by relying upon
    the judgment of Binnie J. in <i>R. v. Sheppard</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869.  He
    submits that the trial judge failed to
    “articulate the thinking process which led to her conclusion” and thereby
    prevented meaningful appellate review which constitutes error of law: see <i>Sheppard</i> at
    paras. 28, 51 and 63.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[23]     On a more specific level, within the confines
    of a particular case, it is widely recognized that having to give reasons
    itself concentrates the judicial mind on the difficulties that are presented
    (<i>R. v. G. (M.)</i> (1994), 93 C.C.C. (3d) 347 (Ont.

    ), at pp. 67-68).  The absence of reasons, however, does not necessarily
    indicate an absence of such concentration.  We are speaking here of the <i>articulation</i> of
    the reasons rather than of the reasoning process itself.  The challenge for
    appellate courts is to ensure that the latter has occurred despite the absence,
    or inadequacy, of the former.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[26]     The appellate court is not given the power
    to intervene simply because it thinks the trial court did a poor job of expressing

    the reasons already expressed above, I am not able to say that the trial

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(iii)     Did the trial judge
      err in refusing to permit cross-examination of Ms. Huisman on certain hypothetical
      situations arising from her examination-in-chief?</span></h4>

page-break-after:avoid'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    examination-in-chief, Ms. Huisman testified to what she would or would not
    have done had she been fully informed of the risks associated with the Ganz
    pelvic osteotomy.  She testified that she would have opted for different
    surgery producing the same result at less risk, which had been suggested
    by Dr. Wedge.  Counsel for Dr. MacDonald sought to establish through cross-examination
    that she would have proceeded with the Ganz pelvic osteotomy if Dr. MacDonald
    had explained to her that there were no other generally accepted procedures
    that would produce the same result with less risk.  The trial judge refused
    to permit this line of cross-examination:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE COURT:  …I realize where your question might
    be focused to, Mr. Downing, because ultimately it is, the question for me
    will be what would a reasonable person do, and I am actually very concerned
    about putting a hypothetical proposition to a witness, who is not an expert
    witness.  You know, she is here to tell us what she observed, what she did,
    what she understood, and in my view, this type of a hypothetical question
    is not a proper question to her, and indeed is not a hypothetical that you
    may be able to have the evidence bear out at the end of the day as well.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>So that is my second difficulty with the question.  So
    my ruling is that is not a proper question to put to the plaintiff.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
page-break-after:avoid'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for Dr. MacDonald also sought to cross-examine Ms. Huisman on her evidence
    that if she had known one of the three cuts made in her pelvis was a blind
    cut, it would have affected her decision to proceed with the surgery.  Counsel
    put to Ms. Huisman the assumption that Dr. MacDonald used an x-ray machine
    to check the location of the cut.  The trial judge refused to permit this
    assumption to be put to the witness:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am uncomfortable with this line of questioning
    because this type of suggestion to her imports a lot of understanding to
    the type of surgical procedure and options that you are putting to her, and
    that is why we are quite comfortable [<i>sic</i>] with a lay witness, because
    we do not know the basis of that person’s understanding, and that is what
    makes the question unfair.  And that is my concern with it. …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I think a hypothetical where you are putting some
    almost technical assumptions to her and some difficulties, [<i>sic</i>] because
    I think it is an unfair question to ask her what she would have done four
    years ago when she was 19, 18.  Okay?  That is my real concern.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
page-break-after:avoid'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the trial judge erred in limiting the cross-examination as she did.  In <i>Arndt
    v. Smith</i> at p. 549, Cory J. said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[N]egligence actions against members of the medical
    profession based on a failure to warn will inevitably be hypothetical, because
    they are based on constructing what would have happened if the patient had
    been fully informed of the risks of the procedure.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>Ms. Huisman, having testified in
    examination-in-chief in respect to hypothetical situations, with the benefit
    of hindsight, was certainly open to full cross-examination on these issues.  The
    fact that the hypothetical questions may have involved technical assumptions
    or medical information does not make the questions unfair in these circumstances.  Counsel
    for Dr. MacDonald was simply attempting to elicit from the witness what she
    would have done had she been provided with certain additional information
    concerning the available alternatives and the procedure involved in the blind
    cut.  This line of questioning goes to what a reasonable patient in the circumstances
    of Ms. Huisman would have done.  It was a legitimate line of inquiry.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    I regard the rulings limiting cross-examination to be in error, I would not
    reverse the trial judge on this ground.  Counsel for Dr. MacDonald submits
    that the line of questioning could have led to an admission by Ms. Huisman
    that she would have proceeded with the Ganz pelvic osteotomy in the face
    of the risk of permanent nerve damage.  Such an admission, he submits, would
    result in the dismissal of the action: see <i>Arndt v. Smith</i> at para.
    13.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    can only speculate what the cross-examination may have produced.  Having
    read and re-read the evidence of Ms. Huisman, I think it is highly unlikely
    that a skilled cross-examiner would have obtained such an admission.  In
    any event, I do not believe that the answers to these questions, although
    relevant, were likely to have added appreciably to the evidence available
    for the trial judge to engage in the analysis required for the modified objective
    test.  Indeed it is clear that the trial judge did not regard either the
    availability of other procedures, as testified to by Dr. Wedge, or the fact
    that one of these cuts was a blind cut as germane to her analysis.  In the
    result, I am not satisfied that the limitation on cross-examination resulted
    in any substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice and thus there is no basis
    to order a new trial: see  the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. C. 43, s. 134(6).</p>

    forgotten significant components of the risk discussion.  Counsel further
    submits that in the face of the trial judge’s finding that Dr. MacDonald
    was a forthright and honest witness, the trial judge’s conclusion concerning
    Dr. MacDonald’s failure to disclose the risk of permanent nerve injury and
    the consequence of foot drop constitutes palpable and overriding error.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree with this submission.  I agree with the trial judge that Dr. MacDonald’s
    note is not inconsistent with the evidence of Ms. Huisman and her mother.  There
    is no inconsistency in the finding that Dr. MacDonald was a forthright and
    honest witness and the trial judge’s preference for the evidence of Ms. Huisman
    and her mother on the risk discussion.  Dr. MacDonald admitted that he did
    not have an independent recollection of the details of the risk discussion
    and relied on his usual practice.  Ms. Huisman and her mother had every reason
    to remember the risk discussion in detail given what was at stake for Ms.
    Huisman.  I see no basis for interfering with the trial judge’s finding of
    fact on this issue.  I see no error and certainly no palpable and overriding
    error.</p>
