    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    have recognized that members of the public are entitled to access to government
    information.  However, this recognition is an entitlement that is vested
    solely through legislation and not as a specific constitutional right.  Indeed,
    the <i>Canadian</i> <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>, as originally
    drafted, intentionally rejected the right of access to government information.  </p>

    this case, the Assistant Commissioner, acting under the <i>Freedom of Information
    and Protection of Privacy Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.31 (the “Act”), dismissed
    the CLA’s appeal from a decision of the respondent Ministry of Public Safety
    and Security (the “Ministry”).<a href="#_ftn1"

    appellant and the intervener assert that now is the time to recognize a right
    of access to information in s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i>.  Further, they
    say that the right to access government information is explicitly recognized
    in s. 10 of the Act.  Moreover, they assert that, if there was no Act, the <i>Charter</i> would
    require it.  Without going so far as the appellant and the intervener assert,
    for reasons that follow I would allow the appeal on the grounds that the
    Act, as currently structured, unjustifiably limits the appellant’s right
    to free expression as guaranteed by s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i>.   </p>

    Racco’s body was found in 1983.  It was believed to be a “mob hit”.  In 1985,
    four men were charged with Mr. Racco’s murder.  They ultimately pled guilty
    to lesser charges of being an accessory to murder and conspiracy to commit
    murder.  In 1990, two other men were charged with Racco’s murder. They were
    initially convicted of first degree murder in 1991.  The appeal of their
    convictions was allowed and a new trial was ordered.  </p>

      1996, during pretrial motions on the retrial, differences between the Crown
      and defence were revealed.  A lengthy motion for a stay of proceedings
      was heard before Glithero J.  Substantial evidence, including testimony
      from the trial Crowns and police officers, was called regarding allegations
      of police and Crown misconduct.  </span></p>

      J. found material non-disclosure and made very extensive factual findings
      and ultimately stayed the proceedings, releasing a lengthy and detailed
      decision (reported at (1997), 36 O.R. (3d) 263).  </span>He held that the
      accused persons’ rights under ss. 7 and 11(d) of the <i>Charter</i> had
      been violated as a result of “abusive conduct by state officials, involving
      deliberate non-disclosure, deliberate editing of useful information, [and]
      negligent breach of the duty to maintain original evidence”. He was particularly
      critical of the Crown in its prosecutorial role and of the police in their
      investigative role. </p>

      prepared for the 1985 prosecution; (2) failure to disclose certain information
      on the appeal; (3) negligent loss of evidence by the police; and (4) unreasonable
      delay of the trial.  </span>There was significant media coverage of the

    Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police and Halton Regional Police asked the OPP
    to investigate the conduct of the police and prosecution.  On April 3, 1998,
    the OPP issued a terse press release, which concluded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The investigation into the missing audio tape found
    no evidence that the officers attempted to obstruct justice by destroying
    or withholding a vital piece of evidence.  The investigation also found no
    evidence that information withheld from defence was done deliberately and
    with the intent to obstruct justice. </p>

    and in advocating for changes in that regard.&nbsp; It was justifiably concerned
    about the apparent discrepancy between the OPP’s brief statement and the
    detailed acts of abusive conduct contained in the judgment of Glithero J.&nbsp; Given
    this discrepancy, the CLA submitted a request under the Act to the Ministry
    seeking records concerning the OPP review. </p>

    response to the CLA’s request, the Ministry refused to disclose a 318-page
    police report, a March 12, 1998, memorandum and a March 24, 1998, letter.  The
    Ministry claimed exemptions under the Act, namely, under s. 14 (law enforcement),
    s. 19 (solicitor-client privilege), and s. 21 (personal privacy).  </p>

    appeal by the CLA, the Assistant Commissioner upheld the assertion of the
    Ministry’s exemptions.  He then considered whether he should apply the public
    interest override in s. 23 and found that it applied in the case of the s.
    21 exemption.  In his view, there was a “compelling public interest” in the
    disclosure of the information that clearly outweighed the confidentiality
    interests served by the s. 21 exemption. </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    the Assistant Commissioner decided that he could not apply the s. 23 public
    interest override to the ss. 14 and 19 exemptions claimed by the Ministry
    because they are specifically excluded by the Act.  He also decided that
    this exclusion did not violate the <i>Charter</i>.  </p>

    Divisional Court held that the public’s right of access to government information
    is a benefit or privilege bestowed by statute, which the government can grant,
    qualify, modify or revoke.  The court rejected the CLA’s submission that
    the public had a right of access to government information in s. 2(b) of
    the <i>Charter</i> or pursuant to the underlying constitutional principle
    of democracy.  </p>
  <h3>Legislative provisions</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    will be helpful to understanding the issues involved and my analysis if I
    set out some of the more relevant provisions of the Act.  Section 1 of the
    Act states:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>1. The purposes of the Act are,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(a)   to provide a right of access to information
    under the control of institutions in accordance with the principles that,</p>
  <p>                        (i)        information should be available to the
    public,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(ii)
          necessary exemptions from the right of access should be limited and
    specific, and </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>decisions
    on disclosure of government information should be reviewed independently
    of government; and </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(b)   to protect the privacy of individuals
    with respect to personal information about themselves held by institutions
    and to provide individuals with a right of access to that information.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    the Act has a twofold purpose: (i) to provide a statutory right of access
    to government information – subject to specific exemptions – and (ii) to
    protect personal privacy.  The Ontario government, when introducing the bill
    for the Act, stated that the three guiding principles behind the legislation
    were that government information should be more readily available to the
    public, that necessary exemptions should be limited and specific, and that
    decisions by ministers and government officials on what information should
    be disclosed should be reviewed by an independent commissioner accountable
    only to the Assembly. <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court decision goes on to set out other relevant provisions of
    the Act.  I believe this is a helpful approach and therefore I will repeat
    what that court provided. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    10 provides a general right of access to a government record unless the record
    falls within one of the exemptions set out in ss. 12 to 22 of the Act, or
    unless the head<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></a> of the institution is of the opinion on reasonable grounds

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN-US>(i)        Does the CLA’s attempt
      to comment on the discrepancy between Glithero J.’s reasons and the OPP’s

    Divisional Court held (and I agree) that there is expressive content at issue
    here: the CLA requested the information in order to comment publicly on the
    discrepancies between Glithero J.’s reasons and the brief response from the
    OPP.  This interpretation accords with the generous and liberal application
    of the s. 2(b) right as expressed in <i>Irwin Toy</i>.  As the Supreme Court
    of Canada noted at 968 of that case, expression “has both a content and a
    form, and the two can be inextricably connected.  Activity is expressive
    if it attempts to convey meaning.  That meaning is its content.”   </span></p>

      this case, the CLA was attempting to comment on the discrepancies between
      the OPP report and Glithero J.’s scathing rebuke of the police and the
      Crown.  The request for information is therefore not the form of the content,
      contrary to the Ministry’s arguments.  Rather, the wording of the request
      is merely the means by which the CLA seeks to gain the information that
      will enable it to express itself.  This expression is not possible if the
      information is not provided.  In other words, if the CLA does not receive
      the requested information, it is incapable of commenting on the discrepancy.  </span></p>

      is true, as the Ministry argued, that the CLA will be able to comment on
      its inability to comment; however, this is not the same as commenting on
      the discrepancy itself since the CLA will have nothing substantial to say
      about that issue.  Therefore, the expressive content at issue, in my opinion,
      is the potential comments the CLA would make should it receive the requested
      information and not the actual request for information.  The expressive
      content, therefore, is dependent on access to the excluded material.</span></p>

      at expression through positive acts.  The fact that the CLA requested information
      that falls within a statutory exemption does not, in my view, automatically

        or by restricting a form of expression tied to content”.  In this case,
        it appears that the purpose of the lack of a public interest override
        to ss. 14 and 19 of the Act — at least in part — is to directly restrict
        the public’s ability to comment on those records.  Indeed, as I have

      are summarized as: </span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN-US>(1) seeking and attaining truth
      is an inherently good activity; (2) participation in social and political

      officers involved in the case committed any wrongful acts.  It promotes
      democracy because the CLA is seeking to inform itself (and the public)

      the Ministry’s submissions regarding legislative intent.  First, t</span><span lang=EN-US>he
      Ministry argues that the fact that members of the House of Commons and
      the Senate considered and rejected an amendment to the <i>Charter</i> that
      expressly adopted a right to information is an important consideration
      in this case.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      agree that the rejection of a right to information clause must be taken
      into account in determining the scope of s. 2(b): see <i>R. v. Prosper</i>,
      [1994] 3 S.C.R. 236.  I would not agree, however, that this rejection leads
      squarely to the conclusion that s. 2(b) cannot be applied to interpret
      a freedom of information statute that was passed subsequent to the adoption
      of the <i>Charter</i>. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      this case, subsequent to the coming into force of the <i>Charter</i>, the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario legislature provided a platform for information disclosure when it
    passed the Act in 1987.  To suggest that the Act cannot be subjected to <i>Charter </i>scrutiny
    simply because the framers rejected a constitutionally entrenched right to
    information would give too much weight to the rejection. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Supreme Court of Canada has often subjected government action to <i>Charter</i> scrutiny
      where the act is not expressly grounded in a <i>Charter </i>right.  For
      example, in</span><span lang=EN-US> </span><i>R. v. Bartle</i>, <span lang=EN
style='color:black;letter-spacing:-.15pt;'>[1994] 3 S.C.R. 173, the court </span><span lang=EN-US>held
      that law enforcement officials are required to disclose to a detained individual
      that a twenty-four-hour duty counsel service exists where the government
      provides one.  Thus, even though there was no constitutional right to such
      a service, where the province provides it, everyone has the right to be
      informed of its existence. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

      Supreme Court of Canada’s reasoning is, in my view, equally applicable
      in this case.  Thus, where the government has passed a freedom of information
      statute, the statute must comply with <i>Charter </i>jurisprudence.  In
      this case, the lack of a public interest override to certain exemptions
      in the Act does not comply with this jurisprudence where the omission has
      the effect of infringing on an applicant’s freedom of expression. </span></p>

    the Ministry pointed out that the Ontario legislative debates show that in
    drafting s. 23, the government considered and rejected a balancing of the
    public interest in disclosure and materials covered by the law enforcement
    (s. 19) and solicitor-client privilege (s. 14) exemptions.  While this explicit
    indicator of legislative intent may be of assistance to a statutory interpretation
    analysis, it is not relevant to a determination of the scope of the CLA’s
    s. 2(b) right to express itself.  If the legislature has constructed a statute
    in such a way that it limits a person’s <i>Charter</i> rights, evidence of
    legislative intent cannot mitigate that limitation<span lang=EN-US>.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      conclusion, my view is that s. 23 of the Act infringes s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i> by
      failing to extend the public interest override to the law enforcement and
      solicitor-client privilege exemptions.  I reach this conclusion for two
      reasons.  First<span
style='color:black'>, as I have said, both the purpose and effect of the Act
      restrict expression.  In the case of the effects analysis, the expression
      that is restricted would promote two of the values underlying free expression — truth
      and democracy — and, therefore, there is an infringement of s. 2(b). </span></span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
      as I have explained, <span style='color:black'>the CLA is engaging in expressive
      activity, and the expression is content-based, not form-based or location-based.   Accordingly,
      applying the Supreme Court’s test set out in </span></span><i>Montréal</i><span
lang=EN-US style='color:black;'>, </span><span lang=EN-US>the requested information
      should not be removed from the protection of s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i>.</span></p>
  <h2><i><span lang=EN-US>2.         Does s. 23 of the Act infringe the underlying
        constitutional principle of democracy?</span></i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

      view of my decision above, it becomes unnecessary to decide this issue.  However,
      I would briefly note that the unwritten constitutional principle of democracy
      is one of the three underlying values that are identified in the s. 2(b)
      analysis.  As I have concluded above, the expression at issue promotes
      democracy, and the effect of the Act is to restrict this expression.  Therefore,
      in the circumstances of this case, to the extent that the s. 2(b) jurisprudence
      already accounts for democracy, it is unnecessary to consider this issue
      as a stand-alone reason to justify disclosure.</span></p>

    the court held that the objective of providing necessary exemptions to the
    general purpose of providing rights of public access to information relates
    to concerns that are pressing and substantial in society.  The court also
    held that the measures selected by the legislature met the <i>Oakes </i>proportionality
    test.  Respectfully, I must once again disagree.</p>
  <h3>(i)        Pressing and Substantial Objective</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    for the purposes of this test.  </p>
  <h3>(ii)       Rational Connection</h3>

    one has argued that if there is any constitutional infringement that it fails
    on this portion of the test.  While it is still open to this court to find
    that there is no rational connection between the statutory objectives of
    the Act and the lack of a public interest override for the exemptions at
    issue, I do not consider it necessary to do so.  </p>
  <h3>(iii)     Minimal Impairment</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

      993.  </span><span lang=EN>The focus of minimal impairment must, in my
      view, take into account the stated objectives of the Act to determine if
      the 2(b) infringement is “as little as possible”.  </span><span
lang=EN-US>Therefore, for my analysis here I will focus on the objective of the
      legislation as stated in s. 1(a)(ii) of the Act, which stresses the need

      again, the Act’s structure reveals the lack of minimal impairment.  The
      existence of a public interest override in the Act demonstrates, as I have
      already said, an intention to disclose information notwithstanding the
      Ministry’s decision to apply certain exemptions.  Thus, even where the
      Minister decides that the information should be exempt, the Information
      Commissioner may still determine that the public interest in disclosure
      outweighs <i>the purpose of the exemption</i> and may order that the record
      be disclosed.  </span></p>

      element of balancing the </span><span lang=EN>competing claims of the public
      interest in disclosure and the purpose of the exemption.  </span><span lang=EN-US>To
      that effect, it ensures that any infringement on free expression is limited

lang=EN-US>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      presence of this balancing of interests for some exemptions demonstrates
      how exemptions can be “specific” and “limited”, with reference to the other
      objectives of the Act.  That is, that information should generally be available
      to the public, and that decisions on disclosure should be reviewed independently
      of government.  </span></p>

      only way for the Act to reasonably achieve its stated objectives of only
      containing “specific” and “limited” exemptions is to ensure that exemptions
      are not so broad that they undermine the values advanced by an access to
      information regime.  In other words, where there is no limit on an exemption,
      the exemption cannot reasonably accord with the Act’s stated objectives. </span><span lang=EN> </span><span lang=EN-US>The
      exemption may be “specific”, in that it only applies to certain types of

      are not fulfilled in a manner that impairs the right to free expression

      access to information, which has the effect of restricting expression,

      would first note that the public interest overrides in those two statutes
      apply to the entire Act.  There are, however, two other substantive differences

      Act apply to every exemption does not re-fashion the s. 23 public interest
      override into a British Columbia- or Alberta-style provision.  It would
      not be as strong as those provisions, because the test for determining
      whether or not disclosure is in the public interest here depends on the
      exemption that would otherwise prevent disclosure. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    23 specifically requires that the Commissioner consider the purpose of the
    exemption when determining whether the public interest warrants disclosure.  In
    my view, those purposes are not undermined by the public interest override
    as it is provided for in s. 23 where those purposes are worked into the equation. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    short, all of the Ministry’s arguments as to why s. 23 should not apply to
    ss. 14 and 19 are compelling arguments that are relevant to the Commissioner’s
    decision whether or not to apply s. 23 to a given record.  Since they are
    available at that stage, it cannot be said that the Act currently minimally
    impairs expression when it does not permit the public interest to <i>potentially</i> override
    the purpose for the exemption.   If the purpose for the exemption is as strong
    as the Ministry argues, then the Commissioner will only be able to exercise
    the public interest override in extremely limited situations.  <span

      the end, the Ministry has not proven on a balance of probabilities that
      the current legislative scheme constitutes a minimal impairment of the
      appellant’s s. 2(b) rights, given the stated objectives of the Act.  A
      complete lack of the application of s. 23 to the exemptions at issue cannot
      reasonably be held to be a “minimal”
    impairment of the <i>Charter</i>.</span></p>

      would respond briefly to the diversion of resources, or the increased cost
      of litigating disclosure requests.  Barring an evidentiary record suggesting
      that the costs would be so prohibitive so as to impair the government’s
      ability to fund law enforcement activities, this argument does not, in
      my view, justify a <i>Charter</i> infringement.  As the Supreme Court of

      have two responses to this.  First, the wording of s. 19 does not necessarily
      grant the Commissioner the jurisdiction to determine whether or not an
      exception to solicitor-client privilege is present so as to justify disclosing
      otherwise privileged communications.  Second, the compelling reasons justifying
      the stringent application of exceptions to solicitor-client privilege support
      an inference that even if the Commissioner were to apply s. 23, in most
      circumstances — including, possibly, the current proceedings — she would
      be unlikely to find that the public interest clearly outweighs the purpose
      for the exemption.</span></p>

      though the appellant succeeds on this appeal, the ultimate decision as

      privacy exemption, it does not outweigh the purpose for the other exemptions

    this case, the objectives of the Act are not met because there is no independent
    oversight of the Minister’s decision not to disclose.  This is because the
    Commissioner has no power to review the Minister’s decision.  The exemption,
    therefore, is not exercised in a limited way since the Act does not provide
    for the possibility that the public interest might outweigh the purpose for
    the exemption.  Thus, the general right to access to information is thwarted.
    The only salutary effect the Ministry can point to is that it has preserved
    its ability to conduct reviews of the police and Crown Attorneys in private.</p>

    the deleterious effects of the Act, I would conclude, are quite serious:
    the government’s failure to let the Commissioner even determine whether it
    is in the public interest to disclose the records arguably puts the administration
    of justice into disrepute.  The lack of an independent means of determining
    whether the records should be disclosed, in light of Glithero J.’s extensive
    findings of specific acts of police and Crown misconduct, places us back
    to an era where government secrecy was the norm and disclosure was at the
    whim of the Minister.  If the public interest outweighs the purpose for the
    exemption, then it cannot be said that the effect on the CLA’s s. 2(b) rights
    is proportional, as there is no salutary benefit to point to.</p>

    would conclude, therefore, that the violation of the CLA’s s. 2(b) rights

    of the proportionality analysis.</p>

    have read the reasons of LaForme J.A. and find myself in disagreement.  LaForme
    J.A. allows the appeal on the narrow basis that s. 23 of the <i>Freedom of
    Information and Protection of Privacy Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.31 (the “Act”)
    restricts the expressive activity of the Criminal Lawyers Association (the “CLA”).  He
    thus found it unnecessary to consider the broader questions raised on the
    appeal, namely whether s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i> creates a positive obligation
    on the government to provide access to information, and whether s. 23 of
    the Act infringes the unwritten principle of democracy.  Since I do not share
    my colleague’s conclusion, I will address these questions as well.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    first consider and reject the contention that s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i> guarantees

    facts of this case.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    reject the CLA’s “effects-based” argument, on the grounds that it conflates
    the two steps of the analysis set out in <i>Irwin Toy Ltd. v. Quebec (Attorney
    General)</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 927, and that when the Act is read as a whole,
    s. 23 cannot properly be seen as a restriction of an underlying statutory
    right of access. </p>

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I

    I express my view that even if one were to find a breach of s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i>,
    “reading in” is not an appropriate remedy in the circumstances of this case. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I

  <h2>I.          SECTION 2(B) OF THE CHARTER DOES NOT INCLUDE A RIGHT TO GOVERNMENT
    DOCUMENTS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;

    CLA, supported by Canadian Newspaper Association (the “Newspapers”), submits
    that s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i> creates a positive obligation on the government
    to provide access to information in its possession.  The Newspapers argue
    that the very concept of freedom of expression itself, and hence s. 2(b),
    includes the substantive right to obtain government information.  The Newspapers
    submit that if the Act did not exist, the <i>Charter</i> would require its
    enactment.  The CLA submits that s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i> creates a
    positive obligation to provide access to information, at least in the particular
    circumstances of this case.  I will discuss the Newspapers’
    position first as that discussion applies to the CLA’s argument as well. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Newspapers submit that a purposive interpretation of s. 2(b) must include
    a right of access to government information, because information is essential
    to one’s ability to express oneself and expression on public issues is vital
    to democracy.  Relying on the jurisprudence enshrining the
    “open courts” principle, they argue that it cannot be the case that “open
    courts” are necessary but “open government” is not.  The CLA also argues
    that the weight of international legal authority now favours recognition
    of a constitutionally-entrenched right to access information in the government’s
    possession.  </p>
  <h2>1.         A purposive approach to s. 2(b)<i></i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    the CLA and the Newspapers point out, the Supreme Court has insisted on a “purposive” interpretation
    of the <i>Charter</i>: see e.g. <i>Hunter v. Southam</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R.
    145.  In <i>R. v. Big M Drug Mart</i>, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295, Dickson C.J.
    explained, at 344, that a purposive interpretation takes account of the following
    factors: “the character and the larger objects of the <i>Charter</i> itself”;
    the “language chosen to articulate the specific right or freedom”; the “historical
    origins of the concepts enshrined”; and, where applicable, the “meaning and
    purpose of the other specific rights and freedoms with which it is associated
    within the text of the <i>Charter</i>.”  Dickson C.J. went on to caution
    that in conducting this analysis, care must be taken not to “overshoot” the
    actual purpose of the right or freedom in question.  He pointed out that
    the <i>Charter</i> was not enacted in a vacuum, and it therefore must “be
    placed in its proper linguistic, philosophic and historical contexts.”  I
    base my analysis of s. 2(b) on this purposive approach.  </p>
  <h2><i>(a)       The text of s. 2(b)</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    its title indicates, the <i>Charter</i> guarantees both rights and freedoms.  Section
    2 of the <i>Charter</i> addresses “fundamental freedoms”, while ss. 3-15
    deal only with <br>
    “rights”.  Section 2(b) provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms: </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=center style='
text-align:center;
line-height:normal;'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote><i>b</i>) freedom of thought, belief, opinion
    and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Reference
      re Public Service Employee Relations Act (Alta.)</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 313
      at 361, Dickson C.J. (dissenting) explained the distinction between rights
      and freedoms under the <i>Charter</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Section 2 of the <i>Charter</i> protects fundamental “freedoms”
    as opposed to “rights”.  Although these two terms are sometimes used interchangeably,
    a conceptual distinction between the two is often drawn.  “Rights” are said
    to impose a corresponding duty or obligation on another party to ensure the
    protection of the right in question whereas “freedoms” are said to involve
    simply an absence of interference or constraint. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>One
    should not apply this distinction rigidly.  Dickson C.J. warned that this
    conceptual approach might fail to capture “situations where the absence of
    government intervention may in effect substantially impede the enjoyment
    of fundamental freedoms.”  Similarly, in <i>Haig v. Canada</i>, [1993] 2
    S.C.R. 995 at 1039, L’Heureux-Dubé J. wrote for the majority that while the
    distinction between “rights” and “freedoms” may be helpful, it does not displace
    the purposive approach articulated <i>Big M Drug Mart</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    and that in some circumstances “positive governmental action might be required” to
    secure a fundamental freedom.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    fundamental freedoms entrenched in s. 2 are therefore structured to guarantee
    a person’s freedom to act without government interference or constraint.  In
    most cases, the <i>Charter</i>’s constitutional guarantees are satisfied
    by government non-action.  However, particular situations may arise where
    positive government action may be required in order to make a fundamental
    freedom meaningful.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the extent to which positive government action may, in exceptional
    cases, be required to secure freedom of expression falls well short of the
    bold contention of the Newspapers that the right to access government information
    is, structurally, a component of the s. 2(b) guarantee.  The distinction
    between a freedom and a right remains a central feature of the <i>Charter</i> and
    provides a basis for rejecting this general contention.  Given the careful
    and consistent distinction the <i>Charter</i> makes between freedoms and
    rights, I would be reluctant to find that s. 2(b), which guarantees a freedom,
    has a right grafted onto it as an unexpressed component of that freedom.  A
    consideration of the legislative history of s. 2(b) fortifies that reluctance.</p>

    is not part of the Canadian constitutional tradition.  Nevertheless, the
    legislative history of the <i>Charter</i> is admissible to interpret its
    provisions and the question is what weight a court should give to the evidence
    introduced in a particular case. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;

    of the usual difficulties in determining the appropriate weight a court should
    give to the intent of the framers of the <i>Charter</i> are not present in
    this case.  No question arises as to whether this court should attribute
    the explanations of the civil servants who drafted the <i>Charter</i>, or
    the individual comments made by ministers or elected members, to the body
    as a whole and thus use them to identify the collective intention of all
    the framers.  Such difficulties do not arise in this case because the following
    clause was considered for inclusion in the <i>Charter</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Right to Information</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5. Everyone has the right to have reasonable access
    to information under the control of any institution of any government.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Special Joint Committee of the Senate and of the House of Commons on the
    Constitution of Canada (the “Committee”), in a formal vote, decided not to
    include the clause in the <i>Charter</i>.  Consequently, here it is certain
    that the framers’ collective intent was that the <i>Charter</i> should not
    include a guarantee of the right to access government information. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the weight to be given to the framers’ intent in this case may be
    distinguished from cases like <i>Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act</i>, [1985] 2
    S.C.R. 486.  In that case, the Supreme Court was interpreting a provision
    that had been included in the <i>Charter</i> and was determining how much
    weight it should give to speeches and comments made by individuals, including
    those of the civil servants, during the Committee proceedings.  By contrast,
    in <i>R. v. Prosper</i>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 236, the Supreme Court was faced
    with a specific constitutional provision that had been considered and rejected
    by the Committee.  In distinguishing between <i>Prosper </i>and <i>Re B.C.
    Motor Vehicle Act</i>, Lamer C.J. wrote in <i>Prosper</i> at 267:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In <i>Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act</i>, [1985] 2 S.C.R.
    486, I stated for the majority that while these Minutes are admissible as
    extrinsic aids to the interpretation of <i>Charter</i> provisions, they should
    not be given “too much weight” … </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The situation here is quite different: at issue
    is a specific clause which was proposed, considered and rejected by our elected
    representatives.  In my opinion, it would be imprudent for this Court not
    to attribute any significance to the fact that this clause was not adopted.  In
    light of the language of s. 10 of the <i>Charter</i>, which on its face does
    not guarantee any substantive right to legal advice, and the legislative
    history of s. 10, which reveals that the framers of the <i>Charter</i> decided
    not to incorporate into s. 10 even a relatively limited substantive right
    to legal assistance (i.e., for those “without sufficient means” and “if the
    interests of justice so require”), it would be a very big step for this Court
    to interpret the <i>Charter</i> in a manner which imposes a positive <u>constitutional</u> obligation
    on governments.  [Underlining in original.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, Lamer C.J.’s comments apply to this case.  It would be a “very big
    step” for the courts to interpret the <i>Charter</i> as guaranteeing a right
    of access to government information when such a right was proposed, considered,
    and rejected by
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region

    ’s Parliamentary representatives.  The framers’ intent to exclude the right

    significant weight in this case. </p>

    while the “living tree” doctrine undoubtedly allows the courts to interpret <i>Charter</i> guarantees
    in light of evolving societal realities, as L’Heureux-Dubé J. wrote in <i>Prosper</i>,<i> supra</i>,
    at 287 in dissent in the case but concurring on this issue:</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'>[T]he “living tree” theory

    on this point, it is worth noting that the CLA and the Newspapers identified
    no changed societal needs since the Committee rejected including a constitutional

    171, Can. T.S. 1976 No. 47 (“<i>ICCPR</i>”), by which Canada has agreed to

    the <i>ICCPR</i> provide useful guidance for interpreting the <i>Charter</i>.  While
    that may be true, in drawing guidance from the <i>ICCPR</i> one should take
    note of textual differences between the two documents.  In this case, the <i>ICCPR </i>guarantees
    the “the right to freedom of expression” and specifically defines that “right” to
    include the right to “seek, receive and impart information”.  Given the significant
    difference in the wording of Article 19 the <i>ICCPR</i> and s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i>,
    the guidance of the <i>ICCPR</i> is of limited assistance in this case. </p>

    am not persuaded that the international law sources relied upon by the CLA
    and the Newspapers are determinative here.  While the <i>ICCPR</i> is deserving
    of weight, it does not require this court to read a right to access government
    information into s. 2(b) the <i>Charter</i>.  Neither it nor the decisions
    of courts and tribunals of other countries or international organizations
    can overcome the dominating weight of the other considerations reviewed above.  Section
    2(b) must be interpreted in the linguistic, philosophic and historical context

    was articulated by this Court in <i>Haig v. Canada</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 995,

  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>The traditional view, in colloquial terms, is

    Divisional Court’s analysis of this first line of authority, and add the
    following observation.  In <i>Haig</i>, <i>supra</i>, the appellant was ineligible
    to vote in a national referendum on the Charlottetown Accord due to the combined
    effect of residency requirements under the <i>Canada Elections Act </i>and
    the <i>Election Act (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Quebec)</i>.  He claimed that the fact he could not vote in the referendum
    infringed his freedom of expression.  L’Heureux-Dubé J. writing for the majority
    held that while casting a ballot is clearly expressive activity, there was
    no positive obligation on the government to allow the appellant to vote in
    the referendum.  She explained, at 1040-41: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A referendum is a creation of legislation.  Independent
    of the legislation giving genesis to a referendum, there is no right of participation.  The
    right to vote in a referendum is a right accorded by statute, and the statute
    governs the terms and conditions of participation.  The Court is being asked
    to find that this statutorily created platform for expression has taken on
    constitutional status. … A government is under no constitutional obligation
    to extend this platform of expression to <u>anyone</u>, let alone to <u>everyone</u>.  A
    referendum as a platform of expression is, in my view, a matter of legislative
    policy and not of constitutional law.  [Underlining in original.]</p>

    the public interest override does not apply to these sections, violates its
    freedom of expression.  The problem with this argument is that the right
    of access to government information, like the right to vote in a referendum
    in <i>Haig</i>, <i>supra</i>, is strictly a creation of legislation.  There
    is no constitutional right to access government information, only a statutory

    expression.  LaForme J.A. allows the appeal on this basis.  I disagree with
    his conclusion and the reasoning upon which it is based. </p>

    his reasons, LaForme J.A. first classifies the comments the CLA would potentially
    make, should it receive the requested information, as the content of expressive
    activity of the CLA.  Next, he finds that the CLA has a right of access to
    government information that arises independently of the <i>Charter</i>.  He
    identifies the Act, particularly s.&nbsp;10, as the source of that right.  He
    then finds that the purpose and effect of s. 23 of the Act is to restrict
    the underlying right of access by failing to provide a public interest override
    to ss. 14 and 19 of the Act.  Thus, he concludes that s. 23 constitutes government
    action which restricts the CLA’s expressive activity and thereby infringes
    its s. 2(b) right to express itself free of government restraint.  To remedy
    this infringement, he reads ss.&nbsp;14 and 19 into s. 23.  </p>

    CLA argues that the comments it would make if it had access to the requested
    information constitute its expressive activity.  The
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address

    Divisional Court agreed, finding, at para. 55, that the expressive activity
    at issue is the CLA’s “desire to comment publicly” on the discrepancy between
    Glithero J.’s findings and the OPP’s conclusion.  Similarly, LaForme J.A.
    characterizes the expressive activity in issue as “the potential comments
    the CLA would make should it receive the requested information”.  Certainly,
    if one accepts this description of the CLA’s expressive activity, it would
    follow that frustrating the CLA’s “desire to comment” or preventing the CLA
    from making “potential comments” affects the CLA’s ability to express itself.  However,
    I am unable to accept this description. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[145]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    CLA submits that the two-step analysis in <i>Irwin Toy</i> applies.  The
    first step is to determine whether the claimant’s activity falls within the
    sphere of conduct protected by s. 2(b).  If it does, the second step is to
    determine whether the purpose or effect of the government action complained
    of was to restrict freedom of expression.  A recent Supreme Court case, <i>Montréal
    (City) v. 2952-1366 Québec Inc.</i>, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 141, added an interim
    step after the first step – asking whether s. 2(b)’s protection extends to
    the method or location of the expression.  I will comment on the interim
    step later.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[146]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    two steps of <i>Irwin Toy</i> are analytically distinct.  Each step serves
    a different purpose and each has its own distinct focus.  The first step
    focuses on the person claiming the protection of s. 2(b).  It examines a
    person’s activity in order to determine whether that activity <i>prima facie</i> falls
    within the scope of guaranteed free expression.  At step one, the challenged
    government action is not relevant.  <span lang=EN-US>The second step focuses
    on the challenged government action in order to determine whether its purpose
    or effect is to restrict freedom of expression. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[147]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Clearly,
    any comments the CLA makes regarding the discrepancy between the findings
    of Glithero J. and the OPP investigation, its request for access to information,
    and its complaints about the government’s refusal to disclose that information
    would be expressive activity.  It is not suggested that the government has
    done anything to restrict that expressive activity.  Rather, the CLA desires
    to examine the OPP report and comment on it but the government has refused
    to disclose the report.  The focus of the CLA’s <i>Charter</i> challenge
    is the “potential comments” that the CLA <i>could</i> make but for the government
    refusing to disclose information. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[148]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    situation the CLA finds itself in – having the “desire to comment” and having “potential
    comments” – is not, in my view, expressive activity.  It is, rather, the <i>effect</i> of
    the government’s refusal to disclose information.  But the effect of the
    government’s action is not relevant at step one of the <i>Irwin Toy</i> analysis
    that focuses on the activity of the claimant.  The effect of the government’s
    refusal does not come into play until step two of the <i>Irwin Toy</i> analysis
    is reached.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[149]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    I see it then, the CLA did not engage in expressive activity upon receiving
    notice of the government’s refusal to disclose the requested information.  Receipt
    of the requested information was the precondition for the CLA’s potential
    expressive activity.  Without it, there is no expressive activity and the
    government’s act of refusing to disclose the information cannot, following
    the <i>Irwin Toy</i> analysis, create expressive activity where none existed.  To
    use the effect of the government’s decision to characterize the CLA’s situation
    as “expressive activity” is to conflate steps one and two of the <i>Irwin
    Toy</i> analysis.  If the restrictive effect of the government’s refusal
    is the basis for recognizing the CLA’s “potential comments” or “desire to
    comment” as expressive activity at step one, then the same refusal will,
    by definition, have the effect of restricting expression at step two.  The
    same question will have been asked and answered at both steps.  Clearly,
    there is a problem with the way the CLA advocates applying the <i>Irwin Toy</i> analysis. </p>

    of the interim step introduced by <i>Montréal (City)</i>, <i>supra</i>, may
    make it clearer that there is no activity of the CLA at this stage.  There
    is nothing that is justiciable under the interim step.  There is no “method
    or location” of any expression to consider.  It is not known what form the
    CLA’s comments will take or the location of their delivery.  It is even possible
    that the CLA might decide not to make comment should it receive the OPP report.  </p>

    I agree that one should take an expansive view of what is “expressive activity”,
    I would conclude that in this case there is no expressive activity at issue.  The
    CLA cannot escape the fact that its real complaint is that the government
    failed to disclose information to it to facilitate its proposed expression.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;

    now turn to the analysis of the next issue:  even if the CLA’s situation
    were identified as “expressive activity”, s. 23 does not restrict that activity.  </p>
  <h2><i>ii)        Section 23 does not have the purpose or effect of restricting

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[153]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    do not accept that for purposes of <i>Charter</i> analysis it is appropriate
    to view s. 23 of the Act in isolation as a stand-alone exception designed
    to restrict an underlying statutory right of access created earlier in the
    Act by s. 10.  In my view, absent irreconcilable repugnancy, it is not appropriate
    to pit one part of a statute against another, first to find an underlying
    statutory right and then to find the negation of that right.  The purpose
    and effect of s. 23 is to work in concert with the other sections to define
    the statutory right.  Section 10, the exemptions in ss. 12 to 22, and the
    exception to the exemptions in s. 23 are properly seen as harmonious parts
    of a single coherent legislative scheme. </p>

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[154]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    understand properly the Act’s legislative purpose, one must read the Act
    as a whole.  It has been long established as a matter of statutory interpretation
    that the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their
    grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the
    object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament or the provincial legislature. </p>

    conclude that the statutory scheme, when read as a whole, does not support
    the CLA’s “effects-based” analysis.  A closer reading of the pertinent provisions
    is instructive.  The legislature took care to state the purposes of the Act
    in s. 1:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The purposes of this Act are,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to provide a right of access

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; information should be available
    to the public,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; necessary exemptions from
    the right of access should be limited and specific, and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; decisions on the disclosure

    and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to protect the privacy of

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[156]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With
    respect to the issues here, ss. 1(a)(i) and 1(a)(ii) are clear that the purpose
    of the Act is to provide the public with a right of access subject always
    to limited and specific exemptions.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[157]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    10, the section which creates the statutory right of access that underpins
    the first leg of LaForme J.A.’s analysis, begins as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Every person has a
    right of access to a record or a part of a record in the custody or under
    the control of an institution unless,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(a)&nbsp; the record or the part of the record falls
    within one of the exemptions under sections 12 to 22 … </p>

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[158]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    10, properly read, does not create a general unrestricted right to government
    information.  By its very terms, the substantive statutory right of access
    that s. 10 creates is subject to the exemptions set out in ss. 12 to 22.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[159]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nor
    does s. 23 restrict the statutory right of access created earlier in the
    Act.  Section 23 provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>23.&nbsp;&nbsp;An exemption from disclosure of a
    record under sections 13, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21 and 21.1 does not apply where

    than restricting the statutory right of access created by s. 10, one can
    read s. 23 as expanding the scope for disclosure.  Section 10 is subject
    to the exemptions in ss. 12 to 22.  Section 23 broadens the right granted
    by s. 10 by creating  an exception to the exemptions, albeit one that does
    not extend to ss. 14 and 19 (and, although not relevant to this appeal, s.
    16 as well).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[161]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Furthermore,
    since disclosure under ss. 14 and 19 is discretionary, no provision of the
    Act prevents disclosure.  Rather, the operative cause of the restriction
    of the CLA’s “expressive activity” is the exercise of the Ministerial discretion
    to refuse disclosure.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[162]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    reason the CLA focuses its attack on s. 23 is not apparent to me.  Using
    the same
    “effects-based” analysis, the CLA could regard the exemptions in ss. 14 and
    19 of the Act and the Ministerial discretion invoking them as restricting
    its underlying statutory right of access to government information.  Pointedly,
    if the decision of LaForme J.A. is implemented, a future decision of the
    Commissioner that the amplified “public interest override” did not apply
    could be attacked as having the effect of frustrating the CLA’s “expressive
    activity”.  This makes apparent that the breadth of the “effects-based” analysis
    is not narrow at all.  A member of the public seeking government information
    can use it to attack any of the exemptions in ss. 12 to 22, any Ministerial
    decision refusing to disclose information, and any decision of Commissioner
    upholding a refusal of information. </p>
