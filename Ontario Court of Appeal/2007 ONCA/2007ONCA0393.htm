    appellant appeals from the judgment of Belobaba J. dismissing her claims
    against her employer, The E.C.E. Group Ltd., for wrongful dismissal, discrimination,
    and negligent administration of her long term disability policy, and dismissing
    her claim against her disability insurer, Unum Provident Canada, for wrongful

      the appellant’s claims against her employer, the trial judge found that </span>E.C.E<span
lang=EN-US> terminated the appellant's employment and that of the other employees
      in her department because it had decided to outsource their work to a third
      party. He also found that the four months of working notice given to the
      appellant was reasonable having regard to her three years and three months
      of employment. </span></p>

      addition, based on a letter written to </span>E.C.E. <span lang=EN-US>by
      the appellant in February 2001, the trial judge found that it was the appellant
      who asked to change her employment from full-time to part-time. Further,
      because the appellant made that request, the trial judge concluded that </span>E.C.E. <span lang=EN-US>was
      under no obligation to reinstate her to full-time employment upon her request. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

      trial judge also found </span><span lang=EN-US>that it was the employees
      who voted to change LTD carriers and that, in any event, there was insufficient
      evidence at trial to establish that the disability coverage provided by
      the previous carrier was superior to that of Unum.</span><span

      the appellant’s claim against her disability insurer, the trial judge concluded
      that the appellant had not completed the 120 day elimination period required
      to qualify for long-term disability benefits at the time of her initial
      claim. Further, based on the medical evidence, he found no wrongful conduct
      in Unum's decision to pay her claim for the period from January 19, 2002
      through to April 4, 2002, to stop payments as of April 5, 2002 and to decline
      to reinstate payments on August 14, 2002.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      appeal, the appellant alleges numerous errors in the trial judge's findings
      and in his interpretation of the LTD policy. We do not accept the appellant's
      submissions. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge's findings concerning the terms of the appellant's employment,
      the termination of her employment and the change in LTD carriers are supported
      by the evidence and are entitled to deference in this court. The appellant's
      February 2001 letter to </span>E.C.E. <span lang=EN-US>made it clear that
      she wished to work part-time and understood the consequences of so doing.
      Moreover, we see no error in the trial judge’s finding that </span>E.C.E. <span lang=EN-US>had
      no obligation to reinstate the appellant to full-time employment following
      her request to work part-time or in his conclusion that the notice of termination
      afforded to her was reasonable in the circumstances. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further,
      even assuming that the appellant could advance a claim for discrimination,
      we are not persuaded that there was a viable basis on the evidence for
      doing so. E.C.E. did not promote anyone from within the appellant’s department
      after June 2000 and the entire department was declared redundant in August
      2001. The appellant did not reveal her disability to E.C.E. until October
      2000.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      addition, we see no error in the trial judge's interpretation of the LTD
      policy. In accordance with the terms of the policy, it was necessary that
      the appellant be
    “unable to perform any of the material and substantial duties of [her] regular
    occupation” throughout the elimination period. The only qualification on
    this requirement was that Unum had to treat the disability as continuous
    if the appellant's disability ceased for 30 days or less during the elimination
    period. Put another way, the policy required that the appellant be completely
    disabled from working throughout the elimination period. In the face of this
    requirement, the appellant was not entitled to disability benefits based
    on a claim that she was partially disabled prior to completing the elimination
    period. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      our review of the record, the appellant continued working, albeit on a
      part-time basis and with some interruptions, until mid September 2001.
      In these circumstances, we see no error in the trial judge’s conclusions
      that the appellant did not satisfy the elimination period requirement until
      January 19, 2002 and that, thereafter, Unum properly paid the appellant
      long term disability benefits until April 4, 2002. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally,
      based on the medical evidence that was available at trial from the appellant's
      own physicians, it was open to the trial judge to find that Unum was entitled
      to stop making disability payments on April 5, 2002.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs of the appeal to the respondent
      E.C.E., if demanded, fixed in the amount of $2,500.00 inclusive of disbursements
      and applicable G.S.T. Given our view that Unum’s LTD policy was worded
      in a way that laypersons might reasonably find confusing, we decline to
      award any costs of this appeal in its favour. </span></p>
