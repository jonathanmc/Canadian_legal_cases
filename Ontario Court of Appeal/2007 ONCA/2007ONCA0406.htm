    appellant appeals the judgment of Mr. Justice Loukidelis dated June 6, 2006,
    allowing the forfeiture application by the Attorney General of Ontario (AGO)
    of the items listed in the style of cause, under the <i>Remedies for Organized
    Crime and Other Unlawful Activities Act, 2001</i>,<i> </i>S.O. 2001, c. 28
    (“the <i>Civil Remedies Act”</i> or
    “the CRA”).  The judgment also dismissed the appellant’s constitutional challenge
    to the Act as being <i>ultra vires</i> the

    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Province of

  <h2>Background </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    March 27, 2003, the police stopped a vehicle which was missing its front
    licence plate.&nbsp; The appellant was the only person in the vehicle.  Following
    investigation, the appellant was arrested for breach of recognizance in connection
    with charges unrelated to this application.  The police searched the vehicle
    incident to the arrest and discovered $29,020 in cash, and a light socket,
    a light ballast and an exhaust fan, items which are commonly used in indoor
    marijuana operations.  Both the money and the equipment smelled strongly
    of marijuana, though no marijuana was found.  The appellant was not charged
    with any drug- related offence because the police did not have sufficient
    information to do so.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsequently,
    the AGO brought an application <i>in rem </i>for forfeiture of the cash and
    equipment under the <i>Civil Remedies Act</i> and in response the appellant
    argued that the CRA is <i>ultra vires</i> the province, violates ss. 7, 8,
    9 and 11(d) of the <i>Charter</i> and questioned the validity of the particular
    order made under the CRA.  The appellant only claimed a proprietary interest
    in the cash. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    well-structured reasons, the application judge rejected the constitutional
    challenge and the <i>Charter </i>violations, and allowed the AGO’s application.  For
    the following reasons, we would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h2>The Civil Remedies Act</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    CRA was enacted in 2001 and took effect in April 2002.  It contains five
    parts.  Part I sets out the purpose of the Act.  It provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>The purpose of
    this Act is to provide civil remedies that will assist in:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(a) compensating
    persons who suffer pecuniary or non-pecuniary losses as a result of unlawful
    activities;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(b) preventing
    persons who engage in unlawful activities and others from keeping property
    that was acquired as a result of unlawful activities;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(c) preventing
    property from being used to engage in unlawful activities; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>(d) preventing injury to the public that may result from conspiracies
    to engage in unlawful activities.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>Briefly
    stated, Part II deals with the preservation, forfeiture and distribution
    of proceeds of unlawful activity; Part III deals with the preservation and
    forfeiture of instruments of unlawful activity, as well as compensation to
    victims; Part IV deals with civil relief for conspiracies that injure the
    public; and Part V deals with general provisions including the standard of
    proof, proof of offences and the collection of information.</p>
  <h2>The issues raised on appeal</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the motion judge erred in:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left'>1) finding that the appellant lacked standing to challenge parts of the
    CRA;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;'>2) his determination
    of the pith and substance of the CRA;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left'>3) failing to classify the CRA as criminal law;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>4) finding that the CRA’s intrusions into the criminal law are incidental
    to its purpose;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left'>5) finding that the CRA does not violate s. 11(d) of the <i>Charter</i>; </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left'>6) finding that the CRA does not violate s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left'>7) allowing the application for forfeiture on its merits.</p>
  <h4>I –
    Standing</h4>
  <h2>Issue 1: Standing </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant puts into issue the ruling of the application judge that the appellant
    lacks standing to challenge certain parts and sections of the CRA.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge noted that it was agreed that the appellant could challenge
    Part II (forfeiture of proceeds of unlawful activity) and ss. 16 (standard
    of proof), 17 (proof of offences) and 18 (unlawful possession) of Part V
    of the CRA, but the AGO argued that the appellant lacked standing to challenge
    Parts III (forfeiture of instruments of unlawful activity) and IV (conspiracies),
    or s. 19 of Part V (collection of information).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    dealing with this issue, the application judge, resting his analysis on the
    decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Kitkatla Band v. British Columbia
    (Minister of Small Business, Tourism and Culture)</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 146
    and <i>MacKay v. Manitoba</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 357 concluded that Part IV
    and s. 19 of Part V of the CRA were not engaged at all on the facts of this
    case.  The appellant has abandoned his claim of standing to challenge Part
    IV and s. 19 of the CRA on the basis that they have no link to this case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to Part III, although it was engaged on the facts of the case, the
    application judge noted that none of the arguments focused on it and that
    the appellant had not argued against the forfeiture of the exhaust fan, light
    ballast and light socket.  The appellant disavowed any ownership or other
    interest in these items and no item over which the appellant claims an interest
    is subject to forfeiture under Part III.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge recognized, on the basis of the decisions in <i>Phillips
    v. Nova Scotia (Commission of Inquiry into the Westray Mine Tragedy</i><i>)</i>,
    [1995] 2 S.C.R. 97 and <i>Hy and Zel’s Inc. v. Ontario (Attorney General)</i>; <i>Paul
    Magder Furs Ltd. v. Ontario (Attorney General)</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 675,
    that courts should refrain from deciding constitutional issues that are unnecessary
    to the resolution of a case or when the parties are not directly affected.  Although
    Parts II and III are similar in some respects, they are not identical.  For
    example, Part II deals with the direct disgorgement of an unlawful gain,
    whereas a forfeiture under Part III is concerned with instruments of unlawful
    activity meaning property that is likely to be used for unlawful activity
    in the future and that does not necessarily involve disgorgement of a gain.  Some
    instruments may be unlawful gains; some may not.  The constitutional analysis
    of the two parts may differ and in fact many of the authorities cited by
    the appellant deal with instruments of unlawful activity rather than unlawful
    gain which is at issue in this case.  All of the constitutional issues on
    this appeal can be disposed of without consideration of Part III. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    the application judge was satisfied that refusing standing to the appellant
    would not have the effect of immunizing the challenged provisions, as he
    was confident that these provisions would be challenged by persons directly
    affected and, in fact, constitutional challenges to Part III are currently
    pending.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the application judge declined to grant standing under his residuary discretion
    (<i>Canadian Egg Marketing Agency v. Richardson</i>, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 157)
    because the challenged provisions had not been fully argued on the merits
    or under the <i>Big M Drug Mart</i> exception (<i>R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.</i>,
    [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295) on the basis that the appellant was not facing criminal
    charges.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the application judge was correct in refusing the appellant standing
    to challenge certain parts of the CRA. We agree with his conclusions that
    the challenged provisions are not necessary to the resolution of the case,
    that part of the CRA is not engaged on the facts of the case and that the
    refusal of standing does not have the effect of immunizing the challenged
    provisions.  We also see no error in the exercise of his discretion.</p>
  <h4>II – The constitutional challenge: federalism</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the outset of this analysis, it is useful to bear in mind certain factors
    that are relevant to the determination of this issue.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    as the application judge noted, provincial legislation is presumptively valid
    and the party seeking to challenge the constitutionality of a law bears the
    burden to establish a breach.  Professor Hogg explains that a legal consequence
    of this “presumption of constitutionality” is that in choosing between two
    competing, plausible characterizations of the law, the court should normally
    choose the one that would support the law’s validity: Peter W. Hogg, <i>Constitutional
    Law of Canada</i>, looseleaf<i> </i>(Scarborough: Thomson Carswell, 1992)
    at s. 15.5(i).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    again as the application judge noted, the Attorney General of Canada has
    not intervened in this case.  In
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <i>Ontario</i><i> Public Service Employees’ Union v.
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario (Attorney General)</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 2, Dickson C.J.C. wrote: “[I]n
    my opinion, the Court should be particularly cautious about invalidating
    a provincial law when the federal government does not contest its validity”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario <i>Civil Remedies Act</i> falls within a larger national and international
    framework of civil forfeiture schemes that operates in addition to conviction-based
    confiscation laws.  Manitoba, Saskatchewan, British Columbia and Alberta
    have all recently enacted civil forfeiture schemes that are similar to Ontario’s
    (Alberta’s has not yet been proclaimed in force), and Quebec recently placed
    a civil forfeiture bill before the National Assembly.  As well, the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">United Kingdom</st1:country-region>
    ,
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Ireland</st1:country-region>
    ,
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      South Africa</st1:country-region>
    , the Commonwealth of Australia and five of the Australian states have recently
    enacted non-conviction-based civil forfeiture statutes.  Most of these jurisdictions
    already had in place conviction-based regimes as part of their criminal law.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Against
    this backdrop, we turn to the issues.</p>
  <h2>Issue 2: Did the application judge err in his analysis of the pith and
    substance of the CRA?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge correctly noted that the first step in the assessment of
    a law’s validity under ss. 91 and 92 of the <i>Constitution Act</i>,<i> 1867</i> requires
    a determination of the true purpose or “pith and substance” of the law.  The
    application judge examined the purpose clause (Part I) in the CRA, the operative
    provisions of the CRA and regulations, as well as the extrinsic material
    surrounding its passage.  The application judge rejected the appellant’s
    submission that the purpose of the CRA is to punish offenders by seizing
    and forfeiting their property.  He found that the true purpose of the legislation
    is, as set out in Part I of the CRA, to require the disgorgement of financial
    gains obtained through unlawful activities, to compensate victims of crime,
    and to suppress the conditions that lead to unlawful activities by removing
    the financial incentives for engaging in such behaviour.</p>

    agree with the application judge’s assessment of the pith and substance of
    the CRA.  In our view, there is no basis on this record to support the submission
    that the CRA is a “colourable” attempt to legislate in relation to criminal
    law.  We can see nothing that would justify going behind the purposes stated
    in Part I of the CRA.  There is nothing in the details of the scheme of the
    CRA or in the manner in which that scheme operates to suggest that the purpose
    of the CRA is other than those stated purposes.  Nor do we see any merit
    to the appellant’s submission that the true purpose of the CRA is to punish
    offenders.  As addressed later in these reasons, forfeiture proceedings under
    the CRA do not rest upon or even involve an allegation that a named individual
    has committed an offence. Forfeiture proceedings do not require or result
    in a conviction or finding of guilt or wrongdoing by a named party.  The
    CRA is aimed squarely at the question of the forfeiture of property obtained
    through unlawful activity and its eventual distribution to the victims of
    crime and others specified in the regulations, not the punishment of offenders.</p>
  <h2>Issue 3: Did the application judge err in failing to classify the CRA as

line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Can.</st1:country-region>
    ), </i>[2000] 1 S.C.R. 783, [Firearms Reference], the Supreme Court reiterated
    that a law can be classified as criminal law when it has a criminal purpose
    backed by a prohibition and a penalty. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    CRA does not define or create any offence.  It has nothing to do with the
    identification, charging, prosecution, conviction or punishment of the offender.  It
    does not seek to impose a penalty, fine or other punishment and does not
    provide for imprisonment.  There is no stigma associated with a civil forfeiture
    of property order sufficient to constitute a punishment. <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the application judge pointed out, this is not a case like <i>R. v. Westendorp</i>,
    [1983] 1 S.C.R. 43, where the impugned legislation created a specific new
    prohibition (being on a street for the purpose of prostitution).  Rather,
    the CRA simply provides that where an offence has been committed under another
    statute, the proceeds or instruments of that offence may be forfeited.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not accept the submission of the intervener the Criminal Lawyers’ Association
    that the forfeiture of ill-gotten gains should be classified as falling exclusively
    within s.&nbsp;91(27), the head of federal legislative power in relation
    to criminal law.  The CRA deals with (1) the civil and property law consequences
    of unlawful activity; (2) the compensation of victims of crime; and (3) the
    suppression of conditions likely to produce crime.  For the following reasons,
    we conclude that these are all matters that fall within the province’s power
    to legislate under s. 92(13) in relation to property and civil rights in
    the province and s. 92(16) in relation to matters of a merely local or private
    nature in the province.</p>
  <h3><span style='font-weight:normal;'>(i) Civil and property law consequences</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    civil and property law consequences of unlawful activity fall squarely within
    provincial power under s. 92(13) in relation to “property and civil rights”.  There
    are well-established, long-standing principles of common law that a wrong-doer
    cannot profit from his or her own wrong and that there is no title to goods
    or property illegally obtained.  It follows, therefore, that legislative
    competence to modify or extend these rules of property law falls within provincial
    legislative competence.  Simply put, legislation providing for the property
    rights to and forfeiture of the proceeds of unlawful activity is legislation
    in relation to rights of property within the province.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    classifying the CRA forfeiture scheme, the application judge correctly applied
    the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <i>Martineau v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Minister of National Revenue),</i> [2004] 3 S.C.R. 737.  That decision held
    that the forfeiture scheme under the federal <i>Customs Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985,
    c. 1 (2<span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";'>nd</span> Supp.) was a civil mechanism.  It
    was not penal in nature for purposes of the application of certain <i>Charter</i> rights.
    In our view, <i>Martineau</i> provides strong support for the proposition
    that forfeiture under the CRA is a matter of civil law. While <i>Martineau</i> was
    not a division of powers case, we see no reason why the reasoning used by
    the court when it considered the forfeiture process under the <i>Customs
    Act</i> should not apply equally to the forfeiture process under the CRA.  The
    court stated at para 45:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left'>This process thus has little in common with penal proceedings.  No one
    is charged in the context of an ascertained forfeiture.  No information is
    laid against anyone.&nbsp;
    No one is arrested.  No one is summoned to appear before a court of criminal
    jurisdiction.  No criminal record will result from the proceedings.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>We do not accept the appellant’s submission that <i>Martineau</i> can
    be distinguished on the basis that the forfeiture provisions at issue there
    were linked directly to the enforcement of the <i>Customs Act</i>.  We fail
    to see why or how the fact that the CRA forfeiture provisions are not linked
    to the enforcement of any particular act renders them any less civil in nature.  They
    are linked to the achievement of the Act’s stated purposes, purposes that
    are within the province’s constitutional domain.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    note that in <i>Walsh v. Director of the Assets Recovery Agency</i>, [2005]
    N.I.C.A. 6 at para. 27, the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal came to the
    same conclusion as <i>Martineau</i> when determining whether civil forfeiture
    provisions complied with the procedural protections accorded to persons charged
    with an offence under the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental
    Freedoms: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left'>The appellant is not charged with a crime. Although it must be shown that
    he was guilty of unlawful conduct in the sense that he has acted contrary
    to the criminal law, this is not for the purpose of making him amenable as
    he would be if he had been convicted of crime.  He is not liable to imprisonment
    or fine if the recovery action succeeds.  There is no indictment and no verdict.  The
    primary purpose of the legislation is restitutionary rather than penal.</p>
  <h3><span style='font-weight:normal;'>(ii) Compensation of victims of crime</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Compensation
    of victims of crime is also a matter of property and civil rights in the
    province.  In <i>R. v. Zelensky</i>, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 940, the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> restitutionary provisions were upheld as valid federal legislation,
    but only because they were tied to the sentencing process.  The clear implication
    of <i>Zelensky</i> is that it is competent for the province to enact legislation
    providing for a civil process aimed at compensation of victims of crime:
    Hogg, <i>supra</i>, at s. 18.11(b).  We note as well that it has been held
    that federal legislation relating to the detention of property seized in
    relation to criminal proceedings “does not preclude recourse to the plenary
    jurisdiction” of a provincial superior court where the proper “legal substratum” of
    property rights and remedies can be determined: <i>R. v. Raponi</i>, [2004]
    3 S.C.R. 35 at paras. 17 and 33.  Parliament itself has made it clear that
    civil remedies for criminal offences are to be accommodated.  See <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, s. 11: “No civil remedy for an act or omission is suspended or
    affected by reason that the act or omission is a criminal offence.”</p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is well established that the suppression of conditions likely to favour the
    commission of crimes falls within provincial competence: see <i>Bedard v.
    Dawson</i>, [1923] S.C.R. 681 at 684 per Duff J.; <i>Attorney General for
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">

      Canada</st1:country-region>
    and Dupond v. City of Montreal, </i>[1978] 2 S.C.R. 770 at 792 per Beetz
    J.  We do not accept the submission that these cases can be distinguished
    on the basis that they focus on future prevention while the CRA focuses on
    past wrongdoing.  Like the closure of the premises in <i>Bedard</i> and the
    banning of parades in <i>Dupond</i>, the forfeiture of proceeds under the
    CRA removes a resource that is capable of being used to promote crime in
    the future. </p>
  <h2>Issue 4: Did the application judge err in finding that the CRA’s intrusions
    into the criminal law are incidental to its purpose?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge accepted that the CRA may intrude into some areas that
    can normally be in the domain of the criminal law, namely, promoting public
    peace, order, security, health and morality.  The application judge found,
    however, that while the CRA<i> </i>does so, these intrusions are merely incidental
    to the statute’s valid provincial purposes and do not render the CRA <i>ultra
    vires</i>.  We agree with this analysis</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, to the extent that the CRA incidentally affects matters traditionally
    inhabited by the criminal law, it does so well within the bounds of what
    Dickson C.J.C. described in <i>General Motors of Canada Ltd. v. City National
    Leasing,</i> [1989] 1 S.C.R. 641 at 669 as the “overlap of legislation [that]
    is to be expected and accommodated in a federal state.”  See also the <i>Firearms
    Reference</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para 26:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='
text-align:left'>Laws mainly in relation to the jurisdiction of one level of
    government may overflow into, or have “incidental effects” upon, the jurisdiction
    of the other level of government.  It is a matter of balance and of federalism:
    no one level of government is isolated from the other, nor can it usurp the
    functions of the other.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    matter of proceeds of crime may have a federal criminal law “aspect”. However,
    it does not constitute a “watertight compartment” into which provincial legislation,
    approaching the issue from a valid provincial “aspect”, cannot intrude.  It
    is, to use the language of Dickson C.J.C. in <i>Rio Hotel Ltd. v. New Brunswick
    (Liquor Licensing Board)</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 59 at 65, a “legislative subject
    matter that can be said to have a ‘double aspect’, so that viewed in one
    light the subject falls within the legislative competence of Parliament and,
    viewed in another light, within the legislative competence of a provincial
    legislature”.  There are several examples of provincial legislation that
    deal with the civil consequences of criminal acts: see <i>Absconding Debtors
    Act, </i>R.S.O. 1990, c. A.2; <i>Fraudulent Conveyances Act, </i>R.S.O. 1990,
    c. F.29; <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8, ss. 233 and 385; <i>Land

line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    have already identified the provincial “aspects” that ground the CRA within
    the grant of legislative power to the province under s. 92: disgorgement
    of ill-gotten gains, compensation for victims of crime and the suppression
    of conditions likely to produce crime. </p>

    Criminal Lawyers’ Association submits that the CRA creates new civil consequences
    for unlawful acts.  This, they argue, will complicate plea bargaining by
    accused persons as it will often be impossible for the accused to know what
    civil consequences may flow from such a plea.  While this may be true, uncertainty
    as to the civil consequences of a guilty plea has always existed.  Although
    the CRA has created a new mechanism which, in some cases, will expose an
    accused to additional civil consequences, this is within the province’s sphere
    of authority and does not frustrate any federal criminal law purpose.</p>

    note finally that no issue arises on the facts of this case as to any conflict
    between the CRA and federal legislation such as the <i>Criminal Code</i>’s

  <h4>III –
    The <i>Charter</i> issues</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    the application judge, the appellant argued that the CRA violates ss. 7,
    8, 9 and 11(d) of the <i>Charter.  </i>The appellant has abandoned the challenge
    to ss. 7 and 9.  The intervener submits that s. 8 is not violated and does
    not address s. 11(d).</p>
  <h2>Issue 5: Section 11(d) of the <i>Charter</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the CRA violates the presumption of innocence guaranteed
    by s. 11 because, under the CRA, the finding that an offence has been committed
    is made on a balance of probabilities.  He further contends that the CRA
    places a reverse onus on a person by having to establish that he or she is
    the legitimate owner of the property.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    11 applies to “any person charged with an offence”.  In <i>R. v. Wigglesworth</i>,
    [1987] 2 S.C.R. 541, Wilson J. established that s. 11 would apply either
    if the nature of the proceedings was criminal or quasi-criminal, or if the
    proceedings would result in true penal consequences.  The proceedings brought
    under the CRA do not fit either description.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    proceedings brought under the CRA are not criminal in nature.&nbsp; The Supreme
    Court established in <i>R. v. Shubley</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 3, that it is
    not the nature of the underlying act that must be considered, but the nature
    of the proceedings.  This is because an act can give rise to multiple legal
    consequences.  As noted above, in <i>Martineau, supra</i>, the Supreme Court
    held that forfeiture proceedings under the <i>Customs </i><i>Act</i> were
    not criminal in nature.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    proceedings brought under the CRA do not result in “true penal consequences”,
    defined in <i>Wigglesworth</i> at 561 as “imprisonment or a fine which by
    its magnitude would appear to be imposed for the purpose of redressing the
    wrong done to society at large”.  It is clear that an application for forfeiture
    cannot result in imprisonment.  Nor is it tantamount to a fine.  In <i>Martineau</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at para. 62, Fish J. stated that civil forfeiture unlike a fine, does not
    take into account principles of sentencing.&nbsp; He further noted, at para.
    63, that forfeiture proceedings are <i>in rem</i>, meaning that “the guilt
    or innocence of the owner of the forfeited property is irrelevant.”  The
    same can be said of proceedings brought under the CRA.  In the present case,
    forfeiture of the property was not dependent on a finding that the appellant
    had engaged in unlawful activity; the AGO only had to establish that the
    property represented the proceeds or instruments of unlawful activity.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    as noted above, a successful application for forfeiture under the CRA does
    not carry the stigma associated with a criminal conviction.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
    the appellant is not a “person charged with an offence” and s. 11 of the <i>Charter</i> does
    not apply. &nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Issue 6: Section 8 of the <i>Charter</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the submission of the Criminal Lawyers’ Association and the respondent
    that, on the facts of this case, no section 8 issue arises and that the issue
    of whether s. 8 is engaged in certain circumstances is best left to be determined
    in another case.</p>

    respect to the cash, the application judge properly found that the onus of
    proving that the money constituted proceeds of unlawful activity rested with
    the Crown.  On the facts before him, the application judge found that the
    appellant’s explanations as to how he acquired the money were not credible.  The
    application judge rejected those explanations and was satisfied, on a balance
    of probabilities, that the money constituted proceeds of unlawful activity,
    that activity being the dealing in or growing of marijuana.</p>

    appellant argues that the application judge then improperly shifted the onus
    of proof onto the appellant to show that he was the “legitimate owner” pursuant
    to the CRA.  We disagree.  The finding that the money constituted proceeds
    of unlawful activity necessarily involved rejecting the appellant’s explanation
    as to how he allegedly became the “legitimate owner.”  It was open to the
    trial judge to prefer the evidence of the police officers over the evidence
    of the appellant and to find that the explanations regarding the origin of
    the cash were not credible.</p>

    appellant failed to raise this issue at the hearing of the application after
    having been made aware of the potential for conflicts in the evidence by
    counsel for the AGO, who invited counsel for the appellant in September 2005
    to consider whether there should be a trial of issues.  At that time, the
    appellant’s counsel was already aware of this Court’s decision in <i>Personal
    Service Coffee Corp. v. Beer</i> (2005), 256 D.L.R. (4th) 466, on which he
    was counsel and upon which he now relies in arguing for a trial of an issue.</p>

    the rather unusual circumstances of this case, it is our view that the appellant
    gave up any right to raise this issue.  He made a tactical decision to proceed
    with the application on the merits and he is stuck with this decision.  To
    use the vernacular, he should not be allowed a second kick at the can.</p>

line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons stated above, the appeal is dismissed.  The application judge
    found that this was a test case and that, as a result, there should be no
    order as to costs.  We are of a similar view and make no order as to costs. </p>
