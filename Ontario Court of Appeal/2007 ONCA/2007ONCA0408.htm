style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    main question in this appeal concerns the legal effect of a rent increase
    purportedly imposed by a landlord in respect of a residential tenancy without
    written notice to the tenant.  At issue is the interplay between ss. 127(1),
    127(4) and 141 of the <i>Tenant Protection Act, 1997</i>, S.O. 1997, c. 24
    (the “Act”).  </p>
  <h2>I.          Background</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Since
    1994, the appellant, Marissa Price, has occupied a residential unit in a
    land lease park community known as Turnbull’s Grove.  She owns the unit,
    but pays rent for her occupancy of the land.  The land is owned by the respondent,
    Turnbull’s Grove Inc. (“TGI”).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant initially lived in her unit part-time.  In 2001 and again in the
    spring of 2002, the then principal of TGI – Douglas Sheppard – informed her
    that if she became a permanent resident at Turnbull’s Grove, her rent would
    be $179 per month.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant claims that she began to live in her unit on a permanent basis
    commencing in about March 2002.  However, in a proceeding commenced by TGI
    for the payment of rent allegedly owing by the appellant, among other relief,
    the Ontario Rental Housing Tribunal (the “ORHT”) found that the appellant’s
    permanent residency began in November 2002.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    May 2002, Sheppard sold TGI to George Land.  In October 2002, Land demanded
    that the appellant pay rent in the amount of $250 per month commencing November
    1, 2002.  This resulted in a rent increase of $71 per month for the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is no dispute that Land did not provide any written notice of this proposed
    rent increase to the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant paid rent of $250 per month from November 2002 until August 31,
    2003.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    August 2003, the Turnbull’s Grove Tenant’s Association purchased the shares
    of TGI from Land, with the goal of creating a not-for-profit community for
    the benefit of the Association’s membership.  The appellant initially signed
    an offer to purchase her unit with the Association, but subsequently withdrew
    it.  At about the same time, she also informed TGI that she would no longer
    pay what she considered to be illegal rent and that, effective September
    1, 2003, she would resume paying rent in the amount of $179 per month.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    April 16, 2004, the appellant filed an application with the ORHT for the
    return of rent monies that she alleged had been collected illegally.  The
    ORHT dismissed her application on the basis that it was statute barred by
    a one-year limitation period set out under the Act.  The appellant did not
    appeal this decision.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    September 16, 2004, TGI filed an application with the ORHT seeking to terminate
    the appellant’s tenancy and to evict her for non-payment of rent.  It also
    sought to recover as arrears of rent the shortfall between the monthly rent
    that the appellant paid effective September 2003 and her alleged rent of
    $250 per month.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    ORHT granted TGI’s application on February 7, 2005.  It rejected the appellant’s
    argument that TGI was barred, under s. 141 of the Act, from claiming rent
    arrears after accepting a lesser amount of rent from the appellant for more
    than one year.  The ORHT also held that the appellant’s lawful rent was $250
    per month for the period November 1, 2002 to December 31, 2004 and ordered
    the appellant to pay rent arrears in the amount of $1,227.02 in instalments
    over a period of six months, failing which TGI could apply to the ORHT for
    an order terminating the appellant’s tenancy without notice and requiring
    her to pay the balance of all rent outstanding.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant appealed to the

    Divisional Court.  On April 18, 2006, the

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant now appeals to this court.  She argues that the

    Divisional Court erred: (i) in its interpretation of s. 141 of the Act; (ii)

    had misrepresented to the Association her intention to join the Association
    and to purchase her unit at Turnbull’s Grove.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>TGI

    the Treasurer and a director of TGI.</p>

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>s. 127(1) A landlord shall not increase the rent

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>            (3) The notice shall be in a form approved

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>            (4)  An increase in rent is void if

  <h2>IV.       Analysis</h2>
  <h2>            (1)       The Statutory Interpretation Issue</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the outset, I would make three preliminary observations.  First, the reasons
    of the ORHT contain no reference to ss. 127(1) and 127(4) of the Act, nor
    any explicit mention of the statutory scheme for rent increases set out under
    the Act.  In addition, although the ORHT relied on s. 141(1) of the Act to
    hold that the legal rent “charged” to the appellant was $250 per month for
    the period November 1, 2002 to December 31, 2004 and $253.75 per month effective
    January 1, 2005,<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> it made no mention of s.&nbsp;141(2) of the Act.  Nor
    did it explain the basis for its conclusion that s.&nbsp;141(1) –
    rather than s.&nbsp;141(2) – was engaged in this case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    like the ORHT, the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court did not refer to ss. 127(1) and 127(4), or to the statutory
    regime established by the Act for rent increases, in its reasons.  In fairness
    to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court, the record before this court does not permit us to discern
    whether these sections of the Act were drawn to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court’s attention.  These sections, together with ss. 141(1) and
    (2) of the Act, were the focus of the appellant’s argument before this court.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> Third,
    in respect of s. 141, the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court said only:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>   On a plain reading of s. 141 of the [Act] it
    is clear that the provision does not establish a limitation period for landlords
    seeking to recover arrears.  The appellant wrongly asserts that landlords
    could simply impose unlawful rents then wait out the limitation period to
    have the rent deemed lawful.  In fact a tenant has valid recourse to the
    [ORHT] subject to s. 141’s 1 year limitation period.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>   As to the issue of estoppel the misrepresentations

    is implemented in non-compliance with the notice provisions of s. 127(1)
    of the Act, the increase is void at law by virtue of s. 127(4).  Implicit
    in this submission is the contention that the

    Divisional Court erred by failing to consider the effect of ss. 127(1) and

    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court erred in its interpretation of s. 141 of the Act because
    s. 141(1) of the Act has no application here and s. 141(2) does not operate

    the appellant maintains that, absent a clear indication of a contrary legislative
    intention – which the appellant says does not appear in the Act – ss. 141(1)
    and (2) should not be construed so as to override s. 127(4) of the Act. </p>

    agree with the appellant that the challenged rent increase imposed by TGI
    in November 2002 was void by operation of s. 127(4) of the Act and, consequently,
    that it was of no legal force or effect.  I also agree that ss. 141(1) and
    (2) of the Act do not operate in this case to render the void rent increase
    lawful.  It follows, in my opinion, that the Divisional Court erred by failing
    to consider the effect of ss. 127(1) and 127(4) of the Act in the circumstances
    of this case and by holding, as it appears to have done, that the rent increase
    attacked by the appellant was deemed to be lawful by virtue of s. 141 of
    the Act.  I reach these conclusions for the following reasons. </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Act is divided into ten parts.  Part VI, which is of particular significance
    to the issues in this appeal, establishes specific rules relating to rent.  These
    include rules concerning the amount of rent charged (ss. 121 and 122) and
    lawful rent (ss. 123 to 128), a guideline regarding rent increases (s. 129),
    agreements to increase or decrease rent (ss.&nbsp;130 to 134), rent increases
    or decreases based on statutory or municipal tax-related measures (ss. 135
    to 137), applications by landlords or tenants to the ORHT with respect to
    rent (ss. 138 to 139.1 and 142 to 144), prohibited additional charges (s.
    140), and deemed lawful rent (s. 141).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    provisions of the Act, including Part VI, reflect the legislature’s aim to
    balance the rights and obligations of tenants and landlords alike.  In this
    overall context, Part VI of the Act establishes a rent control scheme that
    is designed to protect tenants from unfair or arbitrary rent charges or increases.  Two
    central features of this scheme are the requirements that the quantum of
    any rent, including of any rent increase, not exceed amounts permitted under
    the Act (ss. 121(1), 122 and 129(1)) and that no rent increase be imposed
    without adequate advance written notice from the landlord to the affected
    tenant (s. 127(1)).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    connection with the latter notice requirement, s. 127(1) of the Act, in clear
    and mandatory language, prohibits a landlord from increasing the rent “charged” to
    a tenant unless the tenant has first been provided with at least ninety days
    written notice of the landlord’s intention to effect such an increase.  The
    consequence of a landlord’s failure to satisfy this notice requirement is
    set out in s. 127(4) of the Act, which provides that an increase in rent
    is “void”
    if the landlord has not given the notice required by s. 127(1).  Like s.
    127(1), s. 127(4) is precise and unambiguous.   </p>
  <h2><u>Application of Part VI of</u></h2>
  <h2>            <u>the Act to this Case</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, the rent “charged” to the appellant prior to November 2002 was
    $179 per month.  The principal of TGI at that time, George Land, failed to
    comply with s. 127(1) of the Act when he neglected to provide the appellant
    with written notice that her rent was to be increased by $71 per month to
    $250 per month, effective November 1, 2002.  In addition, Land failed to
    give the appellant ninety days notice of the rent increase, as required by
    s. 127(1).  As a result, the November 2002 rent increase was rendered void
    by s. 127(4) of the Act.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sections
    141(1) and (2) of the Act, however, deem certain rent to be lawful in specific
    circumstances.  Under s. 141(1), rent “charged one or more years earlier” is
    deemed to be lawful rent unless an application, in which the lawfulness of
    the rent charged is in issue, is made within one year after the date that
    the amount of rent was first charged.  In contrast, s. 141(2) is focused
    on rent increases, rather than rent
    “charged”.  It deems an increase in rent to be lawful unless an application,
    in which the lawfulness of the rent increase is in issue, is made within
    one year after the date the increase was first charged.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    effect of these saving provisions is to render an otherwise unlawful rent
    or rent increase lawful from and after the first annual anniversary of the
    date of the imposition of the rent or rent increase if, by that date, no
    application has been brought challenging the lawfulness of the rent or rent
    increase.  Thus, a tenant-challenge to the unlawfulness of a rent charge
    or rent increase is essentially precluded one year from the date that the
    rent charge or rent increase was first imposed.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given
    this statutory scheme regarding rent, the question is whether ss. 141(1)
    or (2) of the Act apply to a rent increase rendered “void” by virtue of s.
    127(4), as in this case.  In my opinion, the answer to this question is
    “no”.  I say this for several reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the word “void” has a well-established legal meaning: it imports a lack of
    validity or legal force.  In <i>Wolkow v. Dunnell</i> (1998), 40 O.R. (3d)
    783, this court considered the meaning of a predecessor section to s. 127(4)
    of the Act, set out in s. 7(5) of the <i>Rent Control Act</i>, S.O. 1992,
    c. 11.  Like s. 127(4) of the Act, s. 7(5) of the <i>Rent Control Act</i> provided
    that an increase in rent by a landlord was “void” where the landlord had
    not given the tenant a notice of the proposed rent increase in the form prescribed
    by that statute.  In considering the meaning of s. 7(5) and of a similar
    voiding provision contained in s. 5(2) of the <i>Residential Rent Regulation
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. R.29, Austin J.A. stated at para. 12, “In my view, ‘void’ in
    those sections means empty, spent and of no effect.”  He elaborated, at para.
    15:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The courts have held consistently that, <i>without
      notice in accordance with statutory requirements, rent increases are void,
      in the sense that they are without legal effect</i> and not merely postponed.  [Citations
      omitted and emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    following observations at para. 17 of <i>Wolkow</i> are also instructive:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>   In my view, a fundamental objective of both Acts
    is to clearly define the amount and the circumstances in which rents may
    be increased by a landlord.  Consistent with this objective, the legislation
    provides that a tenant shall be given at least 90 days notice, in the prescribed
    form, of a landlord’s intention to increase the rent.  As the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court held in <i>Re Devitt and Sarochyn, supra, </i>the purpose
    of the 90-day period is to allow a tenant sufficient time to accept the increase,
    or to serve the required 60-day notice to terminate the tenancy.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, by the use of the word “void” in s. 127(4) of the Act, the legislature
    expressed its intention, in plain language, that a rent increase imposed
    without “at least” ninety days advance written notice to the affected tenant
    is of no legal force or effect.  This accords with a fundamental purpose
    of the Act, namely, to control the circumstances in which a landlord may
    effect a rent increase.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    a rent increase rendered void under s. 127(4) of the Act for non-compliance
    by the landlord with the mandatory notice requirement of s. 127(1) is not
    merely unlawful – it is a nullity.  It is as if the increase never occurred.  Accordingly,
    in the case of a void rent increase, there is nothing to be ‘saved’ by the
    curative provisions of s. 141.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the conclusion that ss. 141(1) and (2) are not intended to apply to rent
    increases rendered void under s. 127(4) is reinforced by the fact that s.
    127(4) admits of no exceptions.  It is not expressed to be subject to s.
    141.  Likewise, ss. 141(1) and (2) contain no language evidencing an intention
    that they apply to rent increases affected by s. 127(4).  If the legislature
    had intended that a void rent increase could acquire legal validity under
    ss. 141(1) or (2) by the mere passage of time it may be assumed that this
    intention would have been expressed clearly.  The legislature did not do
    so.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    the conclusion that ss. 141(1) and (2) have no application to void rent increases
    is consistent with the protectory goals of Part VI of the Act.  As I have
    indicated, one of the primary aims of the rent control scheme established
    by the Act is to shelter tenants from arbitrary, peremptory, or unjust rent
    increases.  For this reason, the Act emphasizes the need for advance written
    notice of a proposed rent increase.  The purpose of this notice requirement
    is to ensure that tenants affected by a proposed rent increase are afforded
    sufficient time to make informed decisions about their housing circumstances
    where a landlord seeks to raise their rent.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    127(4) of the Act underscores the fundamental importance of this notice requirement
    by rendering void rent increases imposed without such notice.  The critical
    statutory purpose of the s. 127(1) notice requirement would be significantly
    undermined if ss. 141(1) or (2) of the Act were construed so as to imbue
    otherwise void rent increases with legal validity notwithstanding non-compliance
    with s. 127(1).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fourth,
    on the view of the purpose and effect of ss. 127(1) and 127(4) that I hold,
    as described above, ss. 141(1) and (2) of the Act are not rendered meaningless.  Part
    VI of the Act sets out various rules regarding rent, including, as I have
    stated, the requirement that the quantum of a rent charge or of a rent increase
    not exceed prescribed limits.  Rent amounts that exceed those limits are
    unlawful.  In my opinion, it is to these types of excessive or ‘tainted’ rents
    that ss. 141(1) and (2) are intended to apply.  In other words, ss. 141(1)
    and (2) deem a rent charge or a rent increase to be lawful in certain circumstances
    where they would otherwise be unlawful.  But an
    “unlawful” rent charge or rent increase is not the same as a “void” rent
    charge or rent increase.  Section 141 is directed to the former, while s.
    127(4) is concerned with the latter.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fifth,
    while Part VI of the Act prohibits various conduct in respect of rent and
    rent increases, only conduct concerning a rent increase that offends s. 127(1)
    renders the increase void under Part VI.  This signifies the importance of
    the s. 127(1) notice requirement to the rent control scheme established by
    the Act.  For example, rent charged in contravention of s. 121(1) of the
    Act – rent in an amount that is greater than the lawful rent permitted under
    Part VI of the Act – is not deemed to be void under Part VI of the Act.  This
    type of
    ‘tainted’ rent charge, therefore, could be subject to the remedial effect
    of s. 141(1) of the Act in a proper case.  Similarly, where proper notice
    of a proposed rent increase is given in conformity with s. 127(1) of the
    Act, but the amount of the proposed increase exceeds the permitted increase
    prescribed by the guideline under the Act – in contravention of s.&nbsp;129(1)
    of the Act – s. 141(2) may be engaged.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court indicated that s. 141 affords a “statutory amnesty” to land-lords
    after the expiry of one year from the date of the imposition of a rent charge
    or a rent increase.  I agree, subject to the following important caveat.  This
    amnesty applies only to an unlawful rent charge or rent increase and only
    then where the conditions set out in ss.&nbsp;141(1) or (2) are met.  It
    does not apply to a rent increase rendered void under s.&nbsp;127(4).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    to the extent that there is any ambiguity regarding the interplay between
    ss. 127(1) and 127(4) of the Act, on the one hand, and ss. 141(1) and 141(2),
    on the other hand, the tenant-centred focus of the Act requires that these
    sections be interpreted in a manner that furthers the protective objects
    of the Act.  This both facilitates the achievement of the legislature’s goals
    in enacting the Act and, in accordance with well-established rules of statutory
    interpretation, minimizes the potential for conflict between ss. 127(1),
    127(4) and 141.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    therefore conclude that the rent increase imposed by TGI in November 2002
    was void by virtue of s. 127(4) of the Act for non-compliance with the mandatory
    written notice requirement of s. 127(1).  This type of deficiency cannot
    be cured by the invocation of ss. 141(1) or (2).  Importantly, before this
    court, no argument of laches or estoppel is put against the appellant.  I
    do not wish to be taken as suggesting that such an argument could not arise
    in a proper case, arguably to preclude tenant reliance on s.&nbsp;127(4)
    of the Act many years after an unchallenged imposition of a rent increase
    implemented in non-compliance with s. 127(1) of the Act.  But that is not
    this case.  Accordingly, in this case, the challenged rent increase was of
    no force or effect from the date of its imposition.</p>
