    appeal seeks to suspend a final order for adoption by challenging the validity
    of the underlying Crown wardship order.  The appeal is from the order of
    Patterson J., which allowed an appeal from the order of McSorley J.  McSorley
    J. had granted the appellant status as a parent to move to set aside the
    Crown wardship order. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>F.M.
    was apprehended by the Chatham Kent Children’s Aid Society (CAS) in January
    2004, one day after his birth, because his mother was unable to provide for
    his care.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    January 16, 2004, the CAS obtained an order for Society wardship with access
    to F.M.’s mother.  When his mother did not regularly exercise that access,
    the CAS amended its application in July 2004 to seek Crown wardship without
    access.  The material in support of the applications disclosed that F.M.’s
    father was unknown, but he was one of two men - one of whom was the appellant,
    A.M..  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    October, 2004, the CAS brought a motion for summary judgment on its Crown
    wardship application.  Glenn J. made the necessary finding that F.M.’s paternity
    was unknown, granted the motion, declared F.M. a Crown ward and denied access
    to F.M.’s mother.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Three
    months later, in January, 2005, F.M.’s mother emailed the appellant telling
    him that he was F.M.’s father.  At that time, F.M.’s older brother, D., lived
    with the appellant.  When the appellant heard that he had another son, he
    contacted the CAS and sought to determine whether he was F.M.’s father.  He
    told the CAS that, if he was, he planned to have F.M. live with him and D. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    response to the appellant’s enquiries, the CAS told him that F.M. was a Crown
    ward without access and that he was eligible for adoption.  The CAS urged
    the appellant to seek legal counsel and offered to put the adoption process
    on hold so that the appellant would have the opportunity to prove his paternity.  The
    CAS gave the appellant until March 31 to do so. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    the appellant advised the CAS that he could not afford the paternity tests,
    the CAS agreed to assume that expense.  In May 2005, the tests established
    the appellant’s paternity and the CAS notified the appellant of that result.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> In
    June, the CAS arranged for a home study and a parenting capacity assessment
    to determine the appellant’s ability to parent F.M.  It reiterated its advice
    to A.M. that he retain independent legal counsel.  By this time, although
    the appellant did not give this information to the Chatham Kent CAS, D. was
    not living with the appellant, but was in the care of the Simcoe CAS.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    July 12, in response to a communication from the CAS about the proposed parenting
    assessments, the appellant emailed the CAS telling it to postpone both the
    home study and the assessment.  He also requested a change in jurisdiction
    to accommodate his proposed move to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Newfoundland, where he said he was moving in order to be with his fiancé.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By
    this time, the CAS had received further information about the appellant,
    including the information that D. was in CAS custody; the appellant had a
    pattern of frequent moves; earlier investigations raised concerns about the
    appellant’s ability to care for D.; and, the appellant had an anger management
    problem.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    a result of this information, the CAS wrote the appellant a lengthy letter
    on July 21.  The letter reviewed the appellant and F.M.’s history with the
    CAS, noted that D. was then in CAS care and stated in the clearest possible
    terms that the CAS would not support the appellant’s plan for F.M. or his
    request for a change in jurisdiction to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Newfoundland.  By way of further explanation, the CAS noted that the appellant
    had not told the CAS until July of his intended move to
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Newfoundland even though he had made that plan in March and he knew that
    the plan would affect an assessment of his ability to parent F.M.  After
    concluding that the appellant was unable to provide F.M. with the needed
    stability, the CAS notified the appellant that it would move as soon as a
    suitable match could be found to place F.M. for adoption.  In view of that
    plan, the CAS cautioned the appellant to proceed with any motions as soon
    as possible and again cautioned him to obtain legal advice.  In concluding
    its letter, the CAS told the appellant about a proposed legislative change
    that may allow for contact between a father and an adopted child.  The CAS
    copied this detailed letter to the lawyer whom the appellant had consulted.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>From
    this letter, the appellant would not have been in any doubt about the CAS
    plan to proceed expeditiously regarding F.M.’s future care.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    CAS heard nothing for several weeks.  Finally, on September 11, the appellant
    wrote the CAS advising that his lawyer would soon be bringing a motion for
    access.  On September 22, the CAS again wrote the appellant, copied to the
    appellant’s lawyer, saying that it had received no such motion and that it
    would proceed to place F.M. for adoption on October 3 and, thereafter, to
    finalize the adoption.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    CAS received no response until September 28 and 29, when the appellant advised
    that he would file a motion on October 3, the deadline given him by the CAS
    and which he obviously appreciated was the critical date.  Nonetheless, October
    3 came and went and the CAS heard nothing further from the appellant. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    the CAS placed F.M. for adoption.  After F.’s placement, the appellant filed
    a motion on October 11 seeking to set aside the October 2004 Crown wardship
    order on the basis of inadequate notice.  On the return of the appellant’s
    motion on November 10, the agent for the appellant’s counsel consented to
    a withdrawal of this set aside motion, without prejudice to the appellant
    being able to bring a motion for a status review.  In the course of the November
    10 appearance, the CAS notified the appellant that F.M. had already been
    placed for adoption and queried the court’s jurisdiction to hear the proposed
    status review application.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    CAS heard nothing further from the appellant and proceeded to finalize the
    adoption, a separate proceeding from that of F.M.’s protection proceeding.  The
    adoption hearing was scheduled for December 23.  On December 22, 2006, the
    appellant’s counsel served an application for status review on the CAS.  While
    the application was styled as an application for status review, the prayer
    for relief also sought to set aside the Crown wardship order.  Neither the
    appellant nor his lawyer alerted the caseworker that this application would
    be filed at this late date and it did not come to the caseworker’s attention
    on December 22.  The next morning, December 23, the adoption hearing proceeded
    as scheduled and the adoption order was granted.</p>

    was no persuasive evidence that the CAS deliberately misled the appellant
    in any way or that it deliberately ignored the December 22 material or took
    any steps to halt the adoption hearing for the purpose of circumventing a
    set aside hearing.  We do not agree with the appellant’s characterization
    of the CAS conduct in this case as “fraud”, a characterization made for the
    first time at the appellate level.  In any event, we see no foundation for
    that allegation. </p>

    our view, the CAS acted entirely within its mandate in fulfilling its obligation
    towards the child.  Moreover, it dealt fairly with the appellant because
    it gave him adequate warning of its intention to place the child for adoption
    and to proceed to finalize the adoption.  It gave the appellant a reasonable
    opportunity to put forward a parenting plan and to move to set aside the
    Crown wardship order.  Indeed, on September 22, the CAS specifically advised
    the appellant about the October 3 placement date.  When the appellant failed
    to move in a timely fashion, the CAS acted properly and in the child’s interests,
    as it was bound by statute to do, in proceeding with F.M.’s adoption. </p>

    those circumstances, there is no basis upon which to set aside the adoption

    for the reasons set out above, even assuming for the purpose of this argument
    that the court has inherent or <i>parens patriae</i> jurisdiction to intervene
    to set aside the Crown wardship order, this case did not present the circumstances
    in which it would be appropriate to do so.  The appellant had several opportunities
    to challenge the Crown wardship order had he moved promptly.  This is not
    a case where a gap in legislation prejudiced the best interests of the child.</p>
