    parties are commercial neighbours in

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto. Because of a difference in the elevations of their two properties,
    the appellants’ predecessor in title built a retaining wall between the properties.  Unfortunately,
    the retaining wall encroached on the respondent’s adjacent property at the
    bottom and leaned over that property even farther at the top. As a result,
    in the early 1970s the respondent’s predecessor in title sued the appellants’ predecessor
    for an injunction to remove the encroachment and for damages. That action
    was settled by the 1973 settlement agreement, which allowed the encroachment
    to remain so long as there was no further encroachment, in which event the
    consent would be rescinded.</p>
  <p class=Style1 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    current action arose between the new owners because there was further encroachment
    by the appellants’ wall that impeded the respondent’s use of its property,
    and the parties were unable to resolve the problem. The respondent sued for
    trespass and nuisance seeking removal of the encroachment and damages. The
    appellant defended on the basis that any further encroachment was <i>de minimus</i> and
    was waived, and counterclaimed for an order declaring that it had acquired
    title to the encroachment by adverse possession.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the consent to the encroachment contained in the 1973
    settlement agreement was rescinded under the terms of the agreement by the
    respondent because of the significant further encroachment by the appellant’s
    wall over the years. As a result, she held that the wall constituted a trespass.
    The trial judge granted a mandatory injunction requiring the removal of the
    wall. The counterclaim for adverse possession was dismissed.</p>

    parties own adjacent commercial properties in the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto. The appellants purchased their property in 1984. The respondent
    purchased its property in 1998. When the appellants purchased their property
    from the liquidator of Imperial General Properties Limited, the agreement
    of purchase and sale contained the following acknowledgement:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>2(g) The purchaser acknowledges the title is subject to an agreement
      dated November 15, 1973 between Imperial General Properties Limited and
      Harg Developments Limited and registered in the Registry Division of Toronto
      Boroughs and York South (No. 64) as NY 656131. The purchaser agrees to
      assume the responsibility of the Vendor as set out in the agreement, a
      copy of which is hereto attached as Schedule “B”.</span></p>
  <p class=Style1 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    agreement, dated November 15, 1973, was a settlement agreement entered into
    between the predecessor in title of the appellants, Imperial, and the predecessor
    of the respondent, Harg. Because the elevation of the two adjacent properties
    was not the same, Imperial had constructed a retaining wall between them.<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> The wall is about 260 feet long. When Harg had
    a survey done in 1971 and discovered that the wall encroached on its property,
    it sued Imperial for an injunction requiring Imperial to remove the encroachment.
    According to the 1971 survey, the wall encroached over the property line
    both at its foot and at its top, but to different degrees. Based on that
    survey, the trial judge </p>
  <br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
  <p class=Style1 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>found that in 1971, at the foot of the wall, the encroachment extended from
    2 1/2 inches at one end to 4 1/2 inches at the other end, and at the top
    of the wall, the encroachment measured from 4 1/2 inches to 5 3/4 inches.
    Based on these findings, the trial judge concluded that the entire wall encroached
    on the respondent’s property. </p>
  <p class=Style1 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Imperial
    and Harg settled their action by entering into the 1973 agreement. That agreement
    contained the following eight clauses:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>1.         Harg consents to the said encroachment of the retaining
      wall upon the Harg Lands shown on the survey annexed hereto as Schedule “C” and
      agrees to permit the said encroachment to remain in its present position.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>2.         Imperial agrees to use its best efforts to grade and pave
      at its expense and in a good and workmanlike manner on or before December
      15, 1973, and in any event no later than June 15, 1974, the area between
      Harg’s building and the retaining wall and the area extending immediately
      to the east along the retaining wall to the front of Harg’s Lands.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>3.         Imperial agrees that the pavement referred to in paragraph
      2 hereof will be laid in such a manner that there will be natural drainage
      from the south-west corner of Harg’s building toward the street with the
      exception of the apparent drainage problem that exists at the rear of Harg’s
      Lands.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>4.         Harg and Imperial agree that in the event of any further
      encroachment, Harg’s consent as set out herein shall be rescinded.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>5.         Harg and Imperial further agree that if the retaining wall
      is replaced, Harg’s consent as set out herein shall not apply to any replacement
      wall.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>6.         Imperial agrees to construct on its property within 60
      days a fence or barrier to prevent parked cars from over-hanging the retaining
      wall and interfering with Harg’s traffic flow.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>7.         Harg and Imperial agree that a survey shall be made of
      the retaining wall every three years and the costs of the survey shall
      be divided equally between Harg and Imperial.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>8.         Harg and Imperial consent to a dismissal without costs
      of the action commenced by Harg in the County Court of the Judicial District
      of York by Writ No. 3388/73.</span></p>
  <p class=Style1 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    paragraph 7 called for a survey of the wall every three years, the original
    parties obtained only one survey. That survey, made in 1978, showed that
    the top of the wall had continued to move and at that point the increased
    encroachment varied from 2&nbsp;1/2 inches to 1/8 inch.</p>
  <p class=Style1 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants purchased the Imperial property in 1984. The respondent purchased
    the Harg property in 1998. As part of the closing documentation, the respondent
    obtained a sworn declaration from Harg which included a paragraph dealing
    with the status of the 1973 agreement, and which stated that the agreement
    was “still in full force and effect” and that all of its terms had been complied
    with, except for the requirement to obtain a survey every three years. Mr.
    Goldstein, on behalf of Harg, testified at the trial that when he swore the
    declaration, he believed that the wall had not moved since 1971, and that
    the encroachment was still valid.  He also stated that the owner had never
    given up its interest in the land.</p>
  <p class=Style1 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly
    after the respondent purchased its property, the principal of the company,
    Mr. Doria, advised the appellants that the retaining wall had moved and encroached
    further onto his property and, as a result, he was unable to access the back
    of his building except with small vehicles. As the respondent needed to use
    large vehicles for deliveries and shipments, Mr. Doria asked the appellants
    for access to the back of its building by a route over the appellants’ property.
    The appellants agreed to look into it, but then never responded.</p>
  <p class=Style1 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants did, however, obtain another survey, which is dated April&nbsp;1,
    1998 and shows continuing movement of the wall. The trial judge found that
    the appellants did not disclose this survey to the respondent; instead, their
    representative, Mr. Sliwin, advised Mr. Doria in May 1998 that there was
    no evidence that the wall had moved. The respondent brought this action in
    February 1999. Prior to the trial in August 2004, each side had further surveys
    taken. The trial judge found that in the area between the wall and the respondent’s
    building, the encroachment had increased from the 1971 measurement of 4 inches
    at the west corner of the respondent’s building to 12 3/4 inches, and at
    the east corner from 5 3/4 inches to 8 1/2 inches. She concluded that in
    the area between the respondent’s building and the wall, the entire top of
    the wall, which was 8 inches in width, was “now probably situate entirely
    over the [respondent’s] property”.</p>
  <p class=Style1 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the commencement of the action, the appellants erected a wooden fence along
    the top of the wall. Mr. Sliwin testified that he built the fence after receiving
    an anonymous phone call, complaining about rubbish being blown over the wall.
    He further testified that he informed the respondent before erecting the
    fence. The trial judge disbelieved Mr. Sliwin and accepted Mr. Doria’s evidence
    that he knew nothing about the fence until it was constructed.</p>
  <p class=Style1 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    parties provided the court with expert engineering evidence regarding the
    structural integrity of the wall. The trial judge found that the appellants’
    expert essentially confirmed the respondent’s expert’s concern regarding
    the integrity of the wall. The opinion of the respondent’s expert was that
    the wall was in very poor condition and required replacement. It failed to
    retain forces such as the lateral pressure of the earth, loads from parked
    vehicles above it on the appellants’ property, and most recently, pressure
    from the force of the wind against the newly-erected wooden fence. </p>
  <p class=Style1 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    experts also agreed that the east end of the wall had been reinforced with
    steel tie rod anchors in order to stabilize its movement. The appellants’
    expert said that the rear 60 feet of the wall had no significant structural
    defects, but he agreed that it was possible that 10 metres of the wall where
    it creates the laneway between it and the respondent’s building would have
    to be replaced. The trial judge observed that the main difference between
    the two experts was that Mr. Snowden, the appellants’ expert, said that in
    order to determine with absolute certainty whether the wall was failing,
    excavation on the appellants’ side was required. However, the trial judge
    found that the appellants had been uncooperative in allowing any such testing,
    and noted that the respondent was not required to prove its case categorically
    but only on a balance of probabilities. </p>
  <p class=Style1 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    its amended statement of claim the respondent sought: (1) a declaration that
    the appellants’ wall and the fence on top of it constituted an encroachment,
    a trespass or a nuisance; (2) a mandatory order requiring the appellants
    to remove and replace the wall on the boundary line between the properties
    and effect all necessary repairs to the respondent’s property; (3) damages;
    and (4) if necessary, relief from forfeiture because of the non-compliance
    with s. 7 of the 1973 agreement that required surveys of the wall every three
    years.</p>
  <p class=Style1 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants pleaded in defence that the respondent was precluded from enforcing
    its rights under the 1973 agreement by reason of estoppel, acquiescence or
    because the agreement was non-binding, and that any damages the respondent
    claimed to have suffered were <i>de minimus</i>. The appellants also counterclaimed
    for a declaration that since 1973, they and their predecessor had obtained
    title to the encroached property by adverse possession.</p>
  <p class=Style1 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the trial, the respondent argued its case based on trespass and abandoned
    the claim in nuisance at the beginning of its closing argument.</p>

    a further substantial encroachment.</p>

style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If
    the 1973 agreement ran with the land, the consent of the true owner to the
    original encroachment was rescinded due to the further encroachment. If that
    agreement was merely personal, then the consent given by the respondent’s
    predecessor did not bind the respondent. In either case, the original encroachment
    now constituted a trespass.</p>

    the law at pp. 132-133 as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Trespass to
    land is the act of entering upon land, in the possession of another, or placing
    or throwing or erecting some material object thereon without the legal right
    to do so. In Salmond on Torts, 12the ed. Pp. 160-1, there is the following
    statement:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In such cases,
    in order to be actionable as a trespass, the injury must be direct, within
    the meaning of the distinction between direct and consequential injuries…It
    is a trespass, and therefore actionable per se, directly to place material
    objects upon another’s land; it is not a trespass, but at the most a nuisance
    or other wrong actionable only on proof of damage, to do an act which consequentially
    results in the entry of such objects. To throw stones upon one’s neighbour’s
    premises is the wrong of trespass; to allow stones from a ruinous chimney
    to fall upon those premises is the wrong of nuisance.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Mann</i>,
    the defendant erected a fence adjacent to the dividing line between its property
    and that of the plaintiff. The fence was erected completely on the defendant’s
    property by competent workmen, and when completed, the evidence was that
    it was “straight as a die”. The complaint arose because three years later,
    the plaintiff’s land surveyor noted that the top of the fence was no longer
    straight or upright, but rather leaned over the plaintiff’s property to the
    extent of 1 3/4 inches to 3 3/4 inches. The change was caused by frost or
    snow that had fallen from nearby buildings. There was no evidence of any
    negligence in the construction of the fence.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    that case, the court found that the leaning of the fence was not a direct
    but rather a consequential injury. It therefore did not constitute a trespass,
    but only a nuisance.</p>
  <p class=Style1 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that the further encroachment by the wall resulted
    in a trespass on two separate bases.  First, the original encroachment was
    a wrongful trespass, which was allowed to continue on the terms included
    in the 1973 settlement agreement until the respondent identified the extended
    encroachment and brought this action. The further encroachment by the wall
    revived the original trespass under the terms of the agreement.  Second,
    the further encroachment was itself a trespass caused by the actions of the
    appellants, and could not be said to be indirect or consequential as in the <i>Mann</i> case.  </p>
  <p class=Style1 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit in their factum that any movement of the wall “was not
    caused by the deliberate conduct of the appellants”. The trial judge found,
    based on the evidence of the two expert engineers, that unlike in the <i>Mann</i> case,
    the wall in this case was negligently constructed. The defence expert testified
    that he would only expect about a three inch movement of this wall to be
    natural or normal. In this case, the movement was between three and eight
    inches at the point where the wall forms a laneway with the respondent’s
    building. The trial judge concluded that if only about three inches is normal
    or natural, then “the defence can hardly argue inevitable accident.” The
    trial judge also relied on the evidence of both experts that the wall is
    subject to forces such as parking cars on the appellants’ parking lot on
    top of the wall, and the wind pressure against the fence that Mr. Sliwin
    erected on top of the wall in 2003. She found that both these situations
    were deliberately created by the appellants and that they directly contributed
    to the movement of the wall. In other words, the further encroachment was
    not an unintended or consequential result of building the wall, caused merely
    by natural forces. Nor was it like failing to repair a ruinous chimney with
    the consequence that stones fall from it onto the neighbour’s property. The
    encroachment or the conditions that allowed the encroachment were caused
    by the deliberate actions of the appellants and caused a direct injury within
    the meaning described in the quote from Salmond on Torts.</p>
  <p class=Style1 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    summarize on this issue, the trial judge found that the original encroachment
    constituted a trespass. The 1973 settlement agreement gave the appellants’ predecessors,
    and then the appellants, permission to encroach as long as there was no further
    encroachment. On the evidence, neither party believed there was any further
    encroachment until the respondent purchased the property and had trouble
    driving its trucks between its building and the retaining wall to obtain
    access to the rear of its building. The respondent withdrew permission to
    encroach, based on the increased encroachment of the wall, when the appellants
    would not accommodate its trucks. </p>
  <p class=Style1 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once
    the consent to the encroachment was withdrawn, the original trespass became
    actionable in accordance with the 1973 agreement and the law. In <i>Gross
    v. Wright</i>, [1923] S.C.R. 214, the parties entered into an agreement for
    the construction of a party wall. The defendant breached the agreement by
    deliberately building his side of the wall thinner than the plaintiff’s side,
    causing the entire wall to shift and encroach further than agreed on the
    plaintiff’s side. The Supreme Court found that the defendant was liable not
    only for breach of contract, but for trespass. Duff J. stated at p. 224:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The moment [the
    defendant] began to reduce the thickness of the wall on his own side of the
    line while maintaining unreduced its thickness on the other side he became
    a trespasser. He became a trespasser because having authority to enter upon
    his neighbour’s property for a certain purpose he was using it for another
    purpose for which he was not authorized to enter. </p>
  <p class=Style1 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, this finding of trespass by the original encroachment was sufficient
    to entitle the respondent to a mandatory injunction to remove the encroachment,
    again in accordance with the agreement as well as with the law.</p>
  <p class=Style1 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the trial judge found that the further encroachment also constituted trespass.
    It was not caused by natural forces, but by the actions of the appellants
    and their predecessors, who constructed the fence partially over the respondent’s
    property and in a negligent manner, and who put extra pressure on the defectively
    constructed wall by parking cars on top and building a fence which was subject
    to the pressure of the blowing wind. That extra encroachment therefore caused
    a direct as opposed to a consequential injury. </p>
  <p class=Style1 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the appeal, the appellants challenged the finding that the extra encroachment
    constituted trespass and not nuisance.  That second finding of trespass was
    unnecessary as the basis for the remedy imposed by the trial judge. It was
    sufficient for the trial judge to make the finding of trespass based on the
    rescission of the conditional consent contained in the 1973 agreement.  As
    it is not necessary for this court to decide that legal issue for the purposes
    of this appeal, I would not do so.</p>

    some further encroachment. The appellants say that the further encroachment

    trial judge found that the claim for adverse possession failed on the second
    ground: there was no intention on the part of the appellants or their predecessors
    to exclude the true owner. The original encroachment was allowed to remain
    with the consent of the true owner in accordance with the 1973 settlement
    agreement. The agreement provided that if there was further encroachment,
    the consent “shall be rescinded”. Although the 1978 survey showed some further
    encroachment, it was minimal. It was clear from the actions of the parties
    that neither considered the consent to be rescinded. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the appellants purchased the property from Imperial in 1984, they undertook
    to Imperial that they would be bound by the 1973 agreement, indicating that
    they understood that the encroachment by the wall was there with revocable
    consent. Furthermore, when confronted by Mr. Doria about the condition of
    the wall in 1998, Mr.&nbsp;Sliwin took the position that there was no further
    encroachment by the wall, not that there was and that he had obtained title
    to the encroached area by adverse possession. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge referred to the following passage from A.H. Oosterhoff and W.B.
    Rayner, <i>Anger and Honsberger Law of Real Property</i>, 2d ed., vol. 2
    (Aurora: Canada Law Book, 1985) at s. 3106.4:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Although adverse
    possession in the old sense was abolished by the statute [of limitations],
    the possession which gives a title under the statute must in some sense be
    adverse, or else the statute does not apply. In order for the person in possession
    to establish the quality of possession required by the statute, he must show
    not only exclusive possession but also <i>animus possidendi</i>, that is,
    an intention to exclude the true owner as well as others. Hence, if the person
    is in possession with the consent of the true owner, whether under a license
    or an agreement, the possession is in no way adverse.</p>
  <p class=Style1 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the appellants and their predecessors were in possession of the
    encroached area with the consent of the true owner until 1998, and understood
    that was the case. I agree with the trial judge that, in those circumstances,
    there could not be, nor was there, any intent to exclude the true owner.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants relied at trial and in this court on the case of <i>Keefer v.
    Arillotta</i>, <i>supra</i>, where possession was also pursuant to an agreement,
    in that case an easement. The grantee built a garage on part of the easement
    and parked cars on the rest. The Court of Appeal held that parking cars on
    the easement did not exclude the true owner from the limited use he wished
    to make of the area, but that building a garage did and that because the
    consent did not extend to building a garage, there was adverse possession
    of that area even though there was an agreement. In this case, however, the
    encroachment of the wall was exactly what was agreed to. Once the extent
    of the additional encroachment was known, the consent was rescinded. I agree
    with the trial judge that the <i>Keefer</i> case is distinguishable and not
    applicable to the facts of this case.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Using
    that test, the trial judge found that the structural incursion onto the respondent’s
    property was not fleeting or transitory and that its impact of continuing
    to diminish his access to the rear of the property was significant. In particular,
    the respondent had testified that his business was affected by the restrictions
    on his use of the storage facility at the rear and the difficult access both
    by trucks and by employees in their cars.</p>
  <p class=Style1 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiff testified that he had not quantified the effect of these restrictions
    in terms of actual loss. The trial judge was satisfied based on the nature
    of the restrictions and the fact that they were ongoing and progressive,
    that a nominal damages payment would not adequately compensate the respondent.
    She therefore concluded that the appropriate remedy in all the circumstances
    is a mandatory injunction requiring the appellants to remove the wall forthwith.</p>

    of the wall, and as noted above, the appellants agreed with their vendor

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the trial, the appellants had accused the respondent of extortion, fraud
    and bad faith, because in an attempt to resolve the problem without resorting
    to litigation, the respondent had suggested that he be allowed an alternate
    route to access his property, but stated that failing agreement, he would
    sue for removal of the wall. The trial judge explained that the respondent
    did not act improperly in taking this approach. The respondent believed that
    these unfounded allegations by the appellants entitled it to substantial
    indemnity costs, but the trial judge rejected this position. She observed
    that the
    “extortion” complaint did not take up a lot of time at the trial and did
    not automatically entitle the respondent to costs on the higher scale.</p>
  <p class=Style1 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    the trial judge was critical of the appellants’ conduct of the litigation,
    finding them to be “generally obstinate, unco-operative and evasive throughout
    the proceedings, unusually lengthening the proceedings by tactics such as
    resisting disclosure and production and by being evasive on examinations
    for discovery.”
    Nevertheless, she determined that their behaviour was not egregious enough
    to warrant the imposition of substantial indemnity costs to censure that
    misconduct. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    arriving at the quantum of costs on the partial indemnity scale, the trial
    judge stated that she had reviewed the accounts and supporting material,
    and took into account the appellants’ submissions including “excess in quantum”,
    the fact that the appellants’ approach required the respondent to spend more
    time and the fact that the issues were complex requiring a detailed review
    of the documents and the law. She also found that junior counsel at the trial
    was necessary and justified. Based on her entire analysis, she fixed costs
    in the amount of $200,000 plus $25,000 disbursements, all inclusive of G.S.T.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this appeal, the appellants submit that the quantum of costs awarded is excessive
    and should be reduced. I agree that the amount awarded is high. However,
    the trial judge gave full consideration to all of the arguments and factors
    applicable to the exercise of fixing costs. I see no error in her approach,
    and no basis to interfere with her decision.</p>
