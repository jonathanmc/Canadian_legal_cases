  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      John
    M. Chambers held the position of Deputy Chief of Police with the Chatham-Kent
    Police Services Board (the
    “Board”), pursuant to a written contract dated September 18, 2002. Article
    6.01 of the contract provided that his appointment would terminate on the
    happening of any one of a number of events, including “automatically on the
    expiration of this Agreement, December 31, 2005, except that the term of
    the appointment may be extended by mutual agreement.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Mr.
    Chambers’ contract was not extended or renewed, and he brought an application
    for a declaration that the contract was void. He argued that: (i) the expiry
    of the fixed-term contract, pursuant to article 6.01(b), was a form of dismissal
    not authorized by the <i>Police Services Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.15; and,
    (ii) the duration of the fixed-term contract was so short as to undermine
    the independence necessary for the office of a deputy chief, and the expiry
    provision was therefore void on public policy grounds.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      At
    para. 19 of his reasons the application judge concluded that, in the circumstances
    of this case, the fixed-term provision in Mr. Chambers' contract is void.
    He said:   </p>
  <p class=Quote><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>[19]<b> </b>    In the present
      case I have found a contract of 3 years 3 months to be invalid.  I do not
      wish my conclusion to stand for a proposition that contracts of such length
      are void.  The time duration is a factor to be considered in the context
      of all of the material.  In the context of this case I have concluded that
      this time limitation in this contract in all of the circumstances is more
      likely than not a colourable device to effect termination without reason
      or any form of due process.  As such, as did Justice Rutherford with regard
      to a notice clause in [<i>Re Police Services Board of the City of Pembroke
      and Kidder</i> (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 663 (Gen. Div.)]<i>,</i> I find this
      duration provision void and unenforceable.  I find in the result all of
      Article 6 of the 2002 contract severable.</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    Board appeals from the judgment below and argues that the application judge
    erred in concluding:  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    article 6.01(b) was a colourable device to effect a termination of Mr. Chambers’ appointment
    contrary to the provisions of the <i>Police Services Act; </i>and<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      A third
    issue raised on appeal by the respondent is whether the duration of the fixed-term
    contract is so short as to undermine the independence necessary for the office
    of a deputy chief. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      A fourth
    issue raised in this appeal is that of remedy. As an alternative remedy,
    Mr. Chambers sought a declaration that he “continues to hold office as a
    police officer and member of the Chatham-Kent Police Service after December
    31, 2005.” If article 6.01(b) is held to be valid and Mr. Chambers’ appointment
    as Deputy Chief expires, the issue is whether he nevertheless continues to
    hold office as a police officer and member of the Chatham-Kent Police Service.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>III. Background</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Mr.
    Chambers has been a police officer for approximately 34 years and has served
    in the Chatham-Kent area since 1981.  He was Chief of the Tilbury Police
    Service from 1995 to 1998 when the Tilbury Police Service amalgamated with
    other regional police services to form the Chatham-Kent Police Service.  At
    that time, Mr. Chambers was appointed to the rank of Staff Inspector.  Subsequently,
    on November 13, 2000, he was appointed Deputy Chief. His first written contract,
    dated December 1, 2000, was not for a fixed term but was terminable on death
    or conviction for defined offences.  That agreement was amended on various
    occasions to modify Mr. Chambers’ salary and benefits. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Article
    6.01 of Mr. Chambers’ amended contract dated September 18, 2002 added the
    impugned provision automatically terminating his appointment on December
    31, 2005. Article 6.01 provides as follows: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><u>ARTICLE 6 - TERMINATION</u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>6.01 The Deputy Chief's
    appointment will terminate upon the happening of any of the following events:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>a)    automatically upon
    the Deputy Chief’s death;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><u>b) automatically on the
      expiration of this Agreement, December 31, 2005, except that the term of
      the appointment may be extended by mutual agreement. In the event an extension
      is considered, the Deputy Chief will be notified before September 30, 2005
      and discussions will commence immediately following such notice;</u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>c)   by the Board, without
    notice or pay in lieu thereof for a conviction of a major offence under the
    Act, or a conviction for a serious offence under the Criminal Code. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>IV. The Application Judge's
      Reasons</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying
    on the authority of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Chambly</i><i> (City) v. Gagnon</i>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 8, and <i>Rossmo
    v.
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Vancouver (City) Police Board</i>, [2003] B.C.J. No. 2761 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), the application judge concluded that a deputy chief of police may be employed
    pursuant to a time-limited contract. However, he also found this principle
    was subject to a caveat, namely, that &quot;a fixed term contract not be
    a colourable device such as a colourable device for bypassing discipline
    provisions or due process provisions of police legislation.&quot; He said, &quot;[s]uch
    a colourable device would have the result of achieving in an indirect manner
    that which may be incapable of achievement directly.&quot;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge also noted the decision of Rutherford J. in <i> Pembroke</i> (City) <i>Police
    Services Board v. Kidder</i>, <i>supra</i>, in which a thirty-day termination
    provision for a police chief was struck down, but a ten-year fixed term contract
    was upheld. In particular, the application judge noted that Rutherford J. &quot;pointed
    out that a short term might constitute an indirect mechanism to give a board
    a power of dismissal without reasons or hearing.&quot; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning
    this case, the application judge concluded that article 6.01(b) was just
    such a mechanism designed to give the Board a power of dismissal without
    due process. In addition to setting out his conclusion at para. 19 of his
    reasons, the application judge said the following:</p>
  <p class=Quote><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[15]     The material does not
      support that the time limitation of the 2002 agreement was a colourable
      device to avoid disciplinary action nor was that argument advanced. It
      cannot however be said that the time limitation is without artificiality.
      The original appointment was November 13, 2000 absent contract and was
      without time limitation. The first contract in draft form had a time limitation
      but was objected to and in the result the executed agreement was without
      such a provision.</span></p>
  <p class=Quote><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[16]     There is no evidence
      as to why the time limitation to which the applicant agreed found its way
      into the 2002 agreement. There is some evidence that the contemplated staff
      changes were initiated absent participation or knowledge of the applicant
      who had a front line position of responsibility for administrative matters
      including budget.</span></p>
  <p class=Quote><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[17]     My conclusion is that
      it is more likely than not that the </span></p>
  <br clear=all>
  <p class=Quote><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>duration in the 2002 agreement
      was put in the agreement for a colourable reason. The three year and three
      month term in the context of the prior history, the obligation for an annual
      process dealing with compensation, suggests an ulterior motive contrary
      to the principles discussed by Justice Rutherford. In the result I find
      the term in the 2002 contract for termination December 31, 2005 to be &quot;an
      indirect mechanism to give a municipal board the power to dismiss a (deputy)
      chief without reasons or a hearing by not renewing the contract&quot;.
      In the result, I conclude that Article 6.01 (b) to the agreement of September
      18, 2002 is void and not enforceable and is severable from the balance
      of the agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>V. Analysis</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>i) Did the application
      judge err in concluding that article 6.01(b) is a colourable device to
      effect a termination of Mr. Chambers’ appointment contrary to the provisions
      of the <i>Police Services Act</i>?</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge was correct in holding that there was no evidence in the
    record concerning why the December 31, 2005 expiry date became a part of
    Mr. Chambers’ contract. However, there was evidence indicating that the Board
    included a provision for a fixed-term appointment in its proposal for the
    terms of his original contract, that Mr. Chambers refused to agree to the
    fixed-term appointment at that time, but that he subsequently agreed to a
    fixed-term appointment in a revised contract in which his salary and benefits
    were enhanced. Significantly, there was also uncontradicted evidence on the
    application that Mr. Chambers’ contract was not renewed or extended because
    the Board wanted to reduce the number of administrative positions forming
    part of the police service and use the savings for front-line police services.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I will explain, the responsibilities of a police services board include determining
    the objectives and priorities of a police service and establishing policies
    for the effective management of the service. As such, the functions of a
    board properly include determining the number of police personnel that should
    be involved in management. Moreover, unless prohibited by statute or on public
    policy grounds, entering into a fixed-term contract with a chief or deputy
    chief appears to be an appropriate mechanism for allowing a board to properly
    carry out its important functions.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Viewed
    in this context, in my opinion, there was simply no evidence on the application
    capable of supporting the application judge’s conclusion that article 6.01(b)
    of Mr. Chambers’ contract was a colourable device to enable the Board to
    effect a termination of his contract contrary to the provisions of the <i>Police
    Services Act</i>. It is apparent from the history of Mr. Chambers’ contract
    negotiations that the Board began seeking his agreement to a fixed-term appointment
    from the outset. While there was some evidence that the contemplated staff
    changes were initiated without Mr. Chambers’ knowledge or participation,
    these matters were properly within the purview of the Board’s authority.
    Moreover, there was no evidence that the changes were under consideration
    at the time article 6.01(b) was added to the contract.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the circumstances, I conclude that the application judge erred in holding
    that the termination date was put in the agreement for a

    31(3) and (4) are consistent with the common law principle that a police
    officer conducting a criminal investigation is independent of the control
    of the executive government.  In <i>R. v. Campbell, </i>[1999] 1 S.C.R. 565,
    Binnie J. noted: </p>
  <p class=Quote><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>[27] The Crown’s attempt to identify
      the RCMP with the Crown for immunity purposes misconceives the relationship
      between the police and the executive government when the police are engaged
      in law enforcement. A police officer investigating a crime is not acting
      as a government functionary or as an agent of anybody. He or she occupies
      a public office initially defined by the common law and subsequently set
      out in various statutes.</span></p>
  <p class=Quote><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>... </span></p>
  <p class=Quote><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>[29] It is … possible that in
      one or other of its roles the RCMP could be acting in an agency relationship
      with the Crown.  In this appeal, however, we are concerned only with the
      status of an RCMP officer in the course of a criminal investigation, and
      in that regard the police are independent of the control of the executive
      government.  The importance of this principle, which itself underpins the
      rule of law, was recognized by this Court in relation to municipal forces
      as long ago as <i>McCleave v. City of Moncton</i> (1902), 32 S.C.R. 106.  That
      was a civil case, having to do with potential municipal liability for police
      negligence, but in the course of his judgement Strong C.J. cited with approval
      the following proposition, at pp. 108-9:</span></p>
  <p class=Quote><span
style='font-size:13.0pt'>       Police officers can in no respect be regarded
      as agents or officers of the city.  Their duties are of a public nature.  Their
      appointment is devolved on cities and towns by the legislature as a convenient
      mode of exercising a function of government, but this does not render them
      liable for their unlawful or negligent acts.  The detection and arrest
      of offenders, the preservation of the public peace, the enforcement of
      the laws, and other similar powers and duties with which police officers
      and constables are entrusted are derived from the law, and not from the
      city or town under which they hold their appointment.  </span></p>

    that he continues to hold office as a police officer and member of the Chatham-Kent
    Police Service. It was unnecessary for the application judge to decide this
    issue since he held that Mr. Chambers continued to hold the position of Deputy
    Chief.  </p>

    116(1) of the <i>Police Services Act</i> provides:</p>
  <p class=Quote><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>116.(1) If there is a dispute
      as to whether a person is a member of a police force or a senior officer,
      any affected person may apply to the Commission to hold a hearing and decide
      the matter. </span></p>

'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    s. 116(1)<i> </i>provides that the Commission is empowered to decide that
    question, there is no purpose in remitting this matter to the Superior Court
    for a new hearing on that issue.</p>
