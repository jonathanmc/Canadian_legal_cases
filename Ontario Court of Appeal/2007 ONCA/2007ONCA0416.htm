    Supreme Court of Canada has heard a number of major pension cases in the
    past decade.  In its decisions, the Supreme Court has provided much needed
    guidance in this new and emerging area of law.  As this case shows, however,
    a number of significant questions remain to be decided.     </p>

    appeal addresses a number of those difficult questions, including the following.  When
    is it acceptable for pension plan expenses to be paid from the pension fund?  After
    a plan conversion, is it permissible to use surplus assets in the defined
    benefit part of the pension plan to pay current service costs in respect
    of the defined contribution part of the plan?  What constitutes proper notice
    of an adverse amendment?  When and how are the courts entitled to interfere
    with a costs order of the Financial Services Tribunal?  Does that Tribunal
    have the power to order costs payable from a pension fund?   </p>

    clause.  However, the other three factors –“relative expertise”, “legislative
    provisions” and “nature of the question” – are not static.  As the issues
    on this appeal raise questions of a different nature that engage the Tribunal’s
    expertise and the legislation in different ways, it is necessary to determine
    the standard of review for each such decision by the Tribunal.  That will
    be done at the outset of the analysis on each issue.  However, the following
    general comments on the <i>Pushpanathan </i>factors apply to all and I set
    them out now to minimize repetition.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>Relative expertise</span></b><span
lang=EN-US> – This factor requires the court to consider the expertise that the
      Tribunal brings to bear when deciding a particular matter compared to that
      of the courts.  As Deschamps J. stated in <i>Monsanto</i>,<i> </i>“relative
      expertise must be evaluated in context and in relation to the specific
      questions under review” (para. 9).  </span></p>

      my view, the Tribunal has a greater relative expertise on questions concerning
      pension plan documents.  In that regard, I would echo the comments of Goudge
      J.A. in <i>Monsanto Canada Inc. v.
    <st1:State

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The Act gives the Tribunal the

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State

    Ontario.  While the Tribunal deals with other regulated sectors in addition
    to pensions, the <i>Financial Services Commission of Ontario Act </i>requires
    that, to the extent practicable, members are appointed with experience and
    expertise in the regulated sectors and that they are assigned to cases which
    draw on that experience and expertise.  Hence the Tribunal must be seen as
    having a relative expertise in adjudicating questions relating to pensions.  This
    points to a more deferential standard of review.</span></p>

      paid from the <i>corpus</i> of the trust unless the trust agreement provides
      otherwise.  This understanding is reinforced by s. 23.1 of the <i>Trustee

      interest and penalties were to be paid by the Fund but did not specify
      that the Plan Expenses were to be paid also from the Fund, it was reasonable
      to infer that the expenses were not payable from the Fund and to place
      the obligation to pay such expenses on the company.  The company is responsible
      for the obligations that it undertook; the failure of the original Plan
      documentation to directly address payment of the Plan Expenses does not
      lead to the conclusion that the company is obliged to pay for them.  In
      accordance with general trust practice and principles, the trust fund would
      bear such expenses.  </span></p>

      make two responses to the argument that s. 11 of the Trust agreement precluded
      any amendment permitting payment of the Plan Expenses from the Fund.  This
      argument is based on the limitation in s. 11 that no amendment can be made
      that would permit the Fund to be used other than for the exclusive benefit
      of the employees (the “limitation”).  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
      in my view, the limitation is directed at “true” amendments – that is,
      amendments which change a party’s rights or obligations.  As I have explained,
      the company was under no obligation to pay the Plan Expenses – they could
      have been paid from the Fund from the outset.  Amending the Plan text to
      reflect this made no change to the rights or obligations of any person
      so the limitation was not engaged.  As a procedural matter, an amendment
      was required in order to change the Plan text to make it clear how the
      Plan Expenses were to be paid but that was an amendment in form, not substance.      </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
      s.11 expressly provides that it “is not to be construed to enlarge the
      obligations of the Company beyond those assumed by it under the Plan”.  The
      company was under no obligation to pay for the Plan Expenses.  If the limitation
      in s. 11 is held to preclude an amendment that permits the Fund to be used
      to pay the Plan Expenses, the company will be forced to pay such expenses
      in order to ensure that the Plan continues.  That means that s. 11 will
      have been used to enlarge the company’s obligations beyond those that it
      had assumed under the Plan.  Such a result is directly prohibited by that
      part of s. 11 which provides that it is not to be construed so as to enlarge
      the company’s obligations.</span></p>

'><span lang=EN-US>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally,
      I am of the view that the Tribunal was correct in requiring the company
      to repay the Fund the sum of $6,455.  It will be recalled that the money
      was paid for advice about the addition of the defined contribution option.
      In my view, the company obtained that advice for its own benefit, in order
      to determine whether it wished to alter the structure of the Plan.  Even
      if the advice was obtained by the company in its role as the Plan sponsor,
      that does not mean that it was obtained on behalf of the Plan.  It remains
      information that the Plan sponsor sought in order to determine how it wished
      to proceed in terms of the Plan structure.  As the expense was that of
      the company, it is obliged to pay for it.     </span></p>

      the by-law specified that no amendment could permit the City to recover “any

      purported to allow the City to recover contributions, albeit as compensation
      for services rendered.  That is, the later by-law purported to do that
      which was directly prohibited in the original by-law.  </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In the present case, there was
      no provision making the company responsible for the Plan Expenses, so later
      amendments permitting such expenses to be paid from the Fund are not in
      conflict with original plan documents.  The only obligation placed on the
      company, which came from the original Trust agreement, was to pay for trustee
      fees and expenses incurred in the execution of the trust; the company acknowledges
      that obligation and continues to meet it.</span></p>

      of the money changed in that the City made payments to the fund by way
      of contribution but it would have received money from the fund as compensation
      for the administrative services it had rendered.  Nonetheless, the return
      of money to the City falls within the definition of revocation, namely,
      the return of trust funds to a person who has placed funds in the trust.  In
      the present case, Kerry is not asking that money from the trust fund be

      Tribunal accepted the Committee’s argument that permitting cross-subsidization
      was inconsistent with the provisions of the Trust agreement.  It explained
      this conclusion as follows.  The trust provisions permitted the Fund to
      be used or diverted only for the “exclusive benefit of” Fund beneficiaries.  The
      2000 Plan confined the Fund beneficiaries to Part 1 members.  That is,
      it did not make Part 2 members beneficiaries of the Fund.  Thus, use of
      the Fund by means of a contribution holiday in respect of Part 2 members
      was inconsistent with the Trust agreement requirement that the Fund be
      used only for the exclusive benefit of Fund beneficiaries.    </span></p>

      the Tribunal held that the contribution holidays in respect of Part 2 members

      as beneficiaries of the Fund, with effect from January 1, 2000.     </span></p>

      nothing in the original Plan and Trust documents prohibited the taking
      of contribution holidays.  Consequently, as I explain more fully in the
      following section, </span><i>Schmidt v. Air Products of Canada Ltd.</i>,
      [1994] 2 S.C.R. 611 provides that the company has the right to use the
      actuarial surplus to fund its contributions while the Plan is ongoing.  It
      is significant to note that <i>Schmidt </i>establishes that right even
      where, as here, the trust agreement provides that the fund is to be used
      exclusively for the benefit of plan members.  </p>

    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court’s decision is premised on the notion that the Plan members
    were entitled to surplus while the Plan was ongoing, I respectfully disagree.  <i>Schmidt </i>makes
    it clear that members of a pension plan have no entitlement to the actuarial
    surplus in an ongoing pension plan.  Justice Cory explained in <i>Schmidt</i> that
    members in plans with exclusive benefit language or the equivalent are entitled
    to “two distinct types” of benefits: the benefits promised under the pension
    plan and the right to share in surplus remaining on plan termination (654-5).    </span></p>

      s. 9 of the <i>Pension Benefits Regulations</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 909,
      provides that after a plan conversion, surplus can be used to fund employer
      contributions.  Section 9 reads as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>9.  If an amendment to a pension
      plan with defined benefits converts the defined benefits to defined contribution

      the Plan has introduced a defined contribution component, rather than been

      the company was at liberty to introduce a new category of Plan member:  there
      is nothing in law or the Plan documentation to prevent such an action.  The
      Plan text expressly permits the company to unilaterally amend the plan
      (s. 22).  Thus, the company could amend the Plan to introduce a new category
      of member.  So, for example, if there were part-time employees for whom
      the company wished to provide a pension, it could create a new category
      of members and permit the part-time employees to become Plan members in
      that category.  </span></p>

      recognize that the present case was not simply the introduction of a new
      category of Plan member – it also created a new funding arrangement for
      the payment of pension benefits for the Part 2 members.   Thus, it must
      be asked, does that change the foregoing analysis?  The answer to that

      answer lies in the Plan documentation.  Read as a whole, it is apparent
      that: (1) the Plan and Fund were created to benefit all full-time employees;
      and (2) it was intended that all full-time employees would become members
      of the Plan and beneficiaries of the Fund.  The Plan documents created
      an “open” pension plan in the sense that it was designed for employees,
      an ever-changing class with some employees leaving before retirement and
      new employees joining.  Because employment is not static so neither is
      membership in the Plan.  It does not matter whether new members arrive
      one at a time or as a group, the Plan was designed to permit them to become
      Plan members and Fund beneficiaries.    </span></p>

    Divisional Court.  In my view, a single plan remained after the introduction
    of the defined contribution component.  The fact that the Plan consisted
    of two components does not mean that a new plan was created for Part 2 members.  Control,
    management and administration of the Plan remained with the Retirement Committee
    and the company, as Plan administrator.  The fact that pension benefits were
    payable from the Fund in the case of Part 1 members and from annuities in
    the case of Part 2 members does not lead to the conclusion that there were
    two different plans, particularly as both Part 1 and Part 2 members have
    a claim to any Fund surplus remaining on Plan termination.       </span></p>

      components and two categories of members.  Put another way, it was the
      unexpected liabilities presented by merger with a second plan that led
      to the need for segregation in <i>Aegon</i>.  Absent segregation, the Halifax

    rights would have been diminished by the addition of a new category of beneficiaries
    whose membership was not contemplated at the time the Halifax Plan was created.  In
    the instant case, however, the new category of member was contemplated from
    the outset as the Plan was designed for all full-time employees.     </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, there is no question but that Kerry’s contribution holidays in respect
    of the defined benefit component of the Plan were permissible.  <i>Schmidt</i> establishes
    that an employer may take contribution holidays when a defined benefit pension
    plan enjoys an actuarial surplus, unless the plan documentation explicitly
    provides otherwise.  A specific formula for calculating the employer’s annual
    contribution is an example of such a provision.  However, if an employer’s
    contribution is to be determined by an actuarial calculation of the amount
    necessary to fund promised benefits, a contribution holiday is permissible.  Thus,
    the Plan documentation must be examined to determine whether Kerry was entitled
    to take contribution holidays.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Kerry’s
    funding obligation, as set out in s. 14(b) of the original Plan text, requires
    Kerry to contribute the amount necessary to fund current and future benefits.  Section
    14(b) reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) <u>Contributions by the Company</u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In addition to contributing the full cost of providing
    the Past Service retirement incomes referred to in Section 13(a) of this
    Plan, the Company shall also contribute, in respect of Future Service benefits,
    such amounts as will provide, when added to the Member’s own required contributions,
    the Future Service retirement incomes referred to in Section 13(b) of the
    Plan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    14(b) does not contain a formula by which Kerry’s contributions are determined.  Although
    no explicit reference is made to actuarial calculations, there is no other
    means by which Kerry’s contributions could reasonably be determined.  Section&nbsp;14(b),
    therefore, implicitly permits Kerry to take contribution holidays by limiting
    its contribution obligation to the additional amount needed to pay current
    and future benefits, if any.  When no such amount is needed, Kerry is not
    obligated to contribute.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a result of this determination, it is unnecessary to decide the second question
    raised by the Committee, namely, whether the 1965 amendments permitting contribution
    holidays were invalid.  Because the original Plan text permits the employer
    to take contribution holidays, the 1965 amendment does nothing but make that
    right explicit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    it submits that in other cases, language similar to that in s. 14(b) has
    been held to amount to a formula for determining an employer’s contribution,
    and thus to preclude the taking of contribution holidays.  It points to <i>C.U.P.E.,
    Local 1000 v.

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Those
    cases, however, are fundamentally different.  In those cases, the pension
    plan documentation contained a formula by which the employer’s annual contribution
    was calculated: the employer was to pay the difference between the employees’
    contributions and the benefits either accrued or paid out in a given year.  As
    previously mentioned, s. 14(b) is not such a formula.  It requires Kerry
    to contribute the amount needed to ensure that the Fund will be able to pay
    the current and future benefits owed to Plan members.  This requires a determination
    of the amount needed to ensure that the Fund remains adequately funded rather
    than the amount needed to pay benefits in the current year.  This distinction
    was recognized by LeBel J.A. (as he then was) in <i>Chateauneuf</i> as integral
    to determining whether a pension plan permits contribution holidays (401-2).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the Committee argues that contribution holidays are prohibited by the terms
    of the Plan.  It asserts that the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court failed to appreciate that although contributions do not
    become part of the <i>corpus </i>of the Fund until paid, the requirement
    that Kerry make ongoing contributions is a separate trust obligation imposed
    by the Plan.  As just explained, the Plan does not create such an obligation.  Further,
    this submission is inconsistent with <i>Schmidt</i>.  Beneficiaries of a
    defined benefit pension plan are entitled to the benefits promised by the
    plan, and may be entitled to any surplus actually remaining on plan termination.  They
    do not have a claim to any notional surplus that exists while the plan is
    ongoing.  (See <i>Schmidt </i>at&nbsp;654-5.)  It follows that the Plan members
    cannot compel the employer to make additional contributions to preserve or
    increase the actuarial surplus.  It would be inconsistent with both the result
    and the reasoning in <i>Schmidt</i> to find that Kerry is obliged to make
    contributions while the Fund enjoys an actuarial surplus, given the language
    of s.&nbsp;14(b).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the Committee submits that contribution holidays constitute an impermissible
    partial revocation of trust.  It argues that Kerry has made a binding promise,
    which it cannot unilaterally amend or revoke, to alienate certain property
    to the Fund.  Again, this argument runs squarely contrary to the terms of
    the Plan.  Section 14(b) does not contain an unconditional promise that Kerry
    would alienate property to the Fund.  The promise is that Kerry would make
    contributions when necessary.  Further, it is only after money is contributed
    to the pension trust fund that it becomes trust property and, therefore,
    subject to the possibility of revocation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the Committee argues that clauses permitting contribution holidays should
    be construed narrowly because there is a strong policy interest in requiring
    companies to make ongoing contributions to protect employees against the
    employer’s potential future financial hardship.  <i>Schmidt</i> is a full
    answer to this argument.  Kerry is required by s. 14(b) to make only those
    contributions necessary to ensure the Fund can pay all benefits.  It is legally
    entitled to take contribution holidays so long as that obligation is met.  I
    would add that there is nothing in the record to support such an argument
    in this case.  There is no evidence to suggest that Kerry would be unable
    to make any future contributions that might be required or that the Fund
    will be unable to pay benefits owed.  In fact, given the continuing surplus
    position of the Fund, the evidence is to the contrary.</p>

      as explained above, <i>Lévis </i>makes clear that multiple standards of
      review can apply to different matters decided in a single proceeding.  And,
      considering these questions on the pragmatic and functional approach established

      first question – whether notice was required – depends on interpreting
      s. 26(1) of the Act to determine whether it applies to the conversion option
      amendment.  Although this is a question of mixed fact and law, its outcome
      depends on the proper interpretation of s. 26(1).  As <i>Monsanto </i>makes
      clear, the court’s expertise exceeds that of the Tribunal in matters of
      statutory interpretation.  In addition, if s. 26(1) applies, the Superintendent
      must require the administrator to give notice unless the limited circumstances
      set out in s. 26(4) are found to exist, in which case he can choose to
      not require transmittal of the notice.  Thus, while recognizing that s.
      26(4) creates a limited discretion in the Superintendent, in my view, s.
      26(1) is better understood as mandatory in nature.  A weighing of these

      the particular facts of this case to determine whether the legal requirements

      of the uncertainty and risk for a plan member that such a change brings
      about.  Uncertainty arises because the pension plan changes from one in
      which a plan member receives a guaranteed, defined pension benefit to one
      in which the amount that will be received is unknown until retirement.  Risk
      increases because the plan member bears the full risk of loss or diminution
      if the defined contribution investments do not perform well.  Although
      a conversion to a defined contribution plan does not necessarily result
      in a reduction in benefits, such a result can occur.  Because of that risk
      and the uncertainty as to the quantum of the pension benefit to be received,
      it seems to me that an amendment that converts a defined benefit pension
      plan to a defined contribution plan is within the purview of s. 26(1).  The
      intent of s. 26(1) is to ensure that plan members are apprised of changes
      to their pension plan that may adversely affect their rights.  As the change
      to a defined contribution plan could have that effect, the Superintendent
      was obliged to require Kerry, <i>qua </i>administrator, to transmit notice. </span></p>

    it failed to disclose all of the changes that the 2000 amendments would make
    to the Plan, including the fact that
    “cross-subsidization” would occur.  With respect, that finding does not correspond
    to the matter in issue.  The question was whether Kerry gave adequate notice
    of the conversion option; the question was not whether Kerry had given adequate
    notice of all of the 2000 Plan amendments, including its intended use of
    surplus assets.  The question of adequacy of notice of the latter matters
    does not arise unless it has first been decided that s. 26(1) requires that
    notice be given of such matters.  Whether notice of the other 2000 Plan amendments
    is required is beyond the scope of this appeal as the Committee request to
    both the Superintendent and the Tribunal was based on the specific allegation
    of inadequate notice of the conversion option.  </span></p>

      from my determination that a reasonableness standard of review is appropriate
      on the matter of the adequacy of notice, deference is to be afforded a
      Tribunal decision on such a matter.  However, as the Tribunal gave no meaningful

      election form specified that if the member elected to transfer to the defined
      contribution “plan”, the member would “have no further rights and entitlements
      under the defined benefit plan”.  The quoted phrase encompasses more than
      simply the value of a member’s accrued pension entitlement under the Plan
      (“pension entitlement”).  If it was intended that exercise of the conversion
      option would extinguish not only a member’s pension entitlement but also
      all other rights in the Plan and Fund, including the right to future Plan
      enhancements and to claim entitlement to surplus on Plan termination, then
      the conversion option information was not only misleading, it was incorrect.  As
      explained above in the section on contribution holidays, a single Plan
      remains after the introduction of the defined contribution component and
      all Plan members remain beneficiaries of the Fund.  Thus, conversion to
      the defined contribution component could not, of itself, wipe out such
      rights.        </span></p>

      to register an amendment even if he is concerned that it may be invalid.  Pension
      plan members rely on the Superintendent for complete information on the
      terms of their pension plan.  The legality of plan provisions is often
      a difficult question that requires determination by an appropriate adjudicative
      body.  The Superintendent might choose to register an amendment, even if
      inadequate notice was given or he has received comments that cause him
      to doubt its validity, because he wishes pension plan members to have access
      to as much information as possible about the terms of their plan.  Based
      on that information, the pension plan members can take whatever steps they
      feel are necessary to protect their rights.  </span></p>

      found that any shortcomings in the notice related only to information that

      option.  It is apparent that the Tribunal did not view such shortcomings
      as sufficiently serious that it would cause the amended 2000 Plan text
      to cease to comply with the Act.  Section 18(1) of the Act makes it clear
      that revocation of registration and refusal to register are based on that
      criterion.</span><a

      of but one of the many amendments made in 2000.  Accordingly, I view as

    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court adopted that summary.  Hence, the reasons are adequate to
    explain the result: the Tribunal is a creature of statute and can only exercise
    the powers conferred on it by legislation.  The Tribunal was given the authority
    to award costs payable by a party.  The Fund was not a party to the proceedings;
    hence, the Tribunal did not have the power to award costs payable from the

    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court’s conclusion.  Section 24(1) empowers the Tribunal to order
    one party in a proceeding to pay the costs of another party to the proceeding.  In
    the instant case, the Tribunal could not order that costs be paid from the
    Fund because the Fund was not a party to the proceeding.  The fact that Kerry
    is the administrator of the Plan does not make the Fund a party in the proceedings.       </span></p>

      it may seem unfair that pension plan members have no statutory right to
      fund litigation before the Tribunal from the pension fund, employers also
      have no such right.  Policy considerations cannot override the clear terms
      of the statute.  In any event, there are valid policy considerations for
      not providing access to a pension fund for the purpose of funding legal
      proceedings.  One such consideration is that the causes pursued by litigating
      plan members may not be in the interests of the membership as a whole.  In
      the present case, one of the reasons of the minority of the Tribunal for
      refusing to award costs was that there was insufficient evidence of the
      level of support for the actions of the Committee from the Plan membership.  Another
      consideration is that the solvency of the pension plan could be adversely

    the power of administrative tribunals to order costs, s. 17.1(6) creates
    an exception for costs orders made in accordance with the tribunal’s enabling
    legislation so long as that legislation was in force on February 14, 2000.  The
    FSCO Act meets that test.  Therefore, the Tribunal was not circumscribed
    by s. 17.1 of the SPPA when making its costs decision.     </p>
