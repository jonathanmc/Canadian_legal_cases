style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown appeals an order staying a charge of rape against the respondent on
    the basis that the Crown failed to disclose relevant information in a timely
    manner.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown’s case relied heavily on the evidence of the complainant.  The complainant
    was with Kevin Dickie both before and after the alleged rape.  Not long afterwards,
    the complainant and Dickie had a dispute and the complainant called the police.  Dickie
    began leaving threatening phone messages on the complainant’s phone.  In
    several of those messages he suggested that the complainant’s rape allegation
    was false.  The complainant gave the tapes of the phone messages to the police.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown concedes that the tapes of the phone calls from Dickie to the complainant
    should have been disclosed after they were received by the police.  The Crown
    also concedes that there was no excuse for the delay in disclosing the tapes
    until shortly before the trial was scheduled to begin.  By then, close to
    two years had elapsed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    it is accepted that while the tapes themselves may or may not be admissible,
    they were relevant to the defence, particularly with respect to the complainant’s
    credibility.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge found that the delay in disclosure caused prejudice to the defence
    that could not be cured by an adjournment.  His concern was that when Dickie
    was interviewed by the police shortly before the trial was scheduled to start,
    he had “an apparent memory lapse”.  Dickie started a written statement by
    saying, “[i]t’s been a long time, the details are not clear”.  When asked
    about whether he recalled making the phone calls, his answer was, “I’d seen
    her [the complainant] after that day for sure”. The police did not press
    Mr. Dickie for answers about the important phone calls or for details about
    what he could remember or not.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    stay motion proceeded before the scheduled commencement of the trial.  Evidence
    was called about the circumstances that led to the delay in disclosure.  Unfortunately,
    Mr. Dickie was not called, nor did anyone carry out a detailed interview
    of him to flesh out the extent of his memory.  As a result, the record before
    the trial judge as to Mr. Dickie’s loss of memory, which was the only possible
    basis for a finding of prejudice, was extremely sparse.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    circumstances such as these, the courts have held that it is preferable to
    proceed with the trial and then determine the abuse motion with the benefit
    of all the evidence.  A stay should be granted prior to the conclusion of
    the trial only if
    “it is clear that no other course of action will cure the prejudice” to the
    accused.  This is because the court will be in a better position at the end
    of the trial to determine whether actual prejudice has occurred:  <i>R. v.
    La</i> (1997), 116 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at 109-110 (S.C.C.).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the present case, the Crown asked the trial judge to follow this course of
    action.  In a factum, filed on the abuse motion, the Crown submitted that
    the motion should not be decided until after all the evidence was heard.  She
    relied upon
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    <i>La</i>.  In her oral submissions, the Crown pointed out that a determination
    of prejudice on the record then before the court would be premature and largely
    speculative.  Once the evidence was heard, the prejudice, if any, would be
    known.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his reasons granting a stay, the trial judge did not consider the option
    of adjourning his decision on the motion until after he had heard all of
    the evidence, including possibly the evidence of Kevin Dickie.  In our view,
    he erred in not adopting this approach.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    the trial judge had the discretion to decide a motion such as this before
    trial, he was required to exercise that discretion in accordance with the
    appropriate principles.  Professor David Paciocco in his work entitled
    “The Stay of Proceedings as a Remedy in Criminal Cases:  Abusing the Abuse
    of Process Concept” (1991) 15 Crim. L.J. 315 at 340-41 sets out two criteria
    relating to prejudice that should be fulfilled in order for a stay of proceedings
    to be granted:</p>
  <p><span style='"Times New Roman"'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    prejudice caused by the abuse in question will be manifested, perpetuated
    or aggravated through the conduct of the trial, or by its outcome;  and</p>
  <p><span style='"Times New Roman"'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>no
    other remedy is reasonably capable of removing that prejudice.</p>
  <p>These criteria were adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. O’Connor</i>,
    [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411 at para. 75.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    onus was on the respondent to establish prejudice.  On the record before
    the trial judge, it was not shown that the prejudice was manifest or aggravated.  The
    evidence of prejudice was almost entirely speculative.  It was impossible
    to know whether Kevin Dickie, if interviewed further or called as a witness,
    could have provided details of the phone calls that would have assisted the
    defence.  The police interview was not thorough enough to canvass his memory
    so as to provide any certainty in this regard.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    there was no reason for the trial judge to order a stay of proceedings at
    the outset of the trial, rather than allowing it to proceed and assessing
    the issue of possible prejudice at its conclusion.  Indeed, the cases point
    out that the remedy of a stay for an abuse of process should be exercised
    only rarely.  It is clearly desirable that cases be decided on their merits,
    if possible.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    in our view, the trial judge should not have stayed the charges upon the
    record before him.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is one further issue raised by the respondent that requires some comment.  The
    respondent argues that the trial judge should have stayed the charges because
    of improper Crown conduct.  Shortly before the trial, the Crown attorney
    learned that a private investigator retained by defence counsel was seeking
    to interview the complainant’s husband.  The respondent’s release order contained
    a standard provision prohibiting the respondent from having direct or indirect
    contact with the complainant.  The Crown attorney thought that the intended
    contact by the private investigator breached that condition.  Apparently,
    the complainant did not want to have any contact with anyone from the defence
    team.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown attorney left a voicemail message for defence counsel indicating that
    there should be no contact with the complainant or her husband and, on one
    interpretation of that message, she threatened criminal charges if there
    was contact.  She followed this phone call with a letter, approved by a senior
    Crown, to the same effect.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Defence
    counsel responded to the phone message and letter by launching an abuse of
    process motion claiming Crown misconduct.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    the argument of this appeal, we were surprised to learn that the Crown’s
    office does not have a position as to whether a defence lawyer or an investigator
    acting for an accused is entitled to contact a witness or a complainant for
    purpose of preparing for trial when there is a no contact provision directed
    at an accused.  Since there is no property in witnesses, it seems to us that
    such a provision would not operate in the way the Crown in this case apparently
    thought it did.  We suggest that the Crown Law Office develop a policy with
    respect to the specific wording of bail terms when it is proposed that there
    be a limitation on defence counsel’s ability to contact witnesses in order
    to prepare for trial.  It makes sense that the policy provide that limitations
    of that nature be dealt with expressly by the court after hearing from both
    sides.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Coming
    back to this case, we accept that the Crown attorney was in error in the
    way she interpreted the no contact provision and was somewhat overzealous
    in her approach to defence counsel.  However, as the trial judge noted, there
    is nothing to suggest she acted in bad faith.  We also observe that defence
    counsel could simply have sought clarification about what was obviously a
    different view about the effect of the no contact provision by discussing
    the matter with the Crown or seeking a clarification from the court.  One
    would hope that on both sides, disagreements such as this could be handled
    in a less confrontational way.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    any event, we do not think that the Crown’s action here amounted to the type
    of abuse that warrants a stay of the charges.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the result, the appeal is allowed, and the stay of proceedings is set aside
    without prejudice to the respondent’s ability to renew the application at
    the conclusion of the trial if he sees fit to do so.  </p>
