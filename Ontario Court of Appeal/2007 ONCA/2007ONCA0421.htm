  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>A.        OVERVIEW</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    is a sentence appeal.  After a lengthy hearing, Morten J. declared the appellant,
    Rodney Allen, a dangerous offender.  That declaration means that Mr. Allen
    must serve an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment.  The question we must
    resolve is whether to change the sentence imposed by the trial judge and
    declare Mr. Allen a long-term offender.  That declaration means that Mr.
    Allen would serve a fixed sentence of imprisonment followed by release into
    the community under a supervision order.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Allen, who is now fifty years old, suffers from homosexual hebephilia.  He
    is attracted to boys entering puberty.  His disorder manifests itself by
    his seeking out, often by deceit, boys aged eleven to fourteen, so that he
    can be near them.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    March 2001, Mr. Allen pleaded guilty to six offences: two sexual assaults,
    each on a fourteen-year-old boy; threatening to burn the property of the
    father of one of the boys; carrying a pellet gun for a dangerous purpose;
    indecent assault and gross indecency on two other boys.  The first four offences
    took place in the summer of 1999; the latter two offences took place in 1983.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown then brought a dangerous offender application on the basis that Mr.
    Allen had committed a sexual assault, and that by his conduct he had shown
    a failure to control his sexual impulses and a likelihood of committing future
    injury or pain to other persons.  The trial judge granted the application.  He
    rejected designating Mr. Allen a long-term offender because he was not satisfied
    there was a reasonable possibility that Mr. Allen’s risk of reoffending could
    eventually be controlled in the community.  The trial judge found that Mr.
    Allen could not be effectively treated and could not be effectively managed
    in the community.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Allen acknowledges that he meets the statutory criteria under the <i>Criminal</i> <i>Code</i>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, for a dangerous offender declaration.  He contends,
    however, that the trial judge erred by failing to exercise his discretion
    to designate him a long-term offender.  He makes two main submissions in
    support of his contention.  First, he submits that the trial judge overstated
    the seriousness of his criminal conduct and, therefore, his danger to the
    public.  Second, he submits that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence
    on whether he could be treated and whether his risk of reoffending could
    be managed in the community.  </p>
  <h2>B.        MR. ALLEN AND HIS CRIMINAL CONDUCT</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Allen was forty-five years old at the time he was sentenced.  He has a minor
    and unrelated adult criminal record.  Growing up, he had difficulties at
    home and at school.  Up until age five, he suffered from epileptic seizures.  Psychological
    reports produced when he was a young boy suggest that these seizures caused
    brain damage.  According to I.Q. testing conducted at the Centre for Addiction
    and Mental Health following his guilty plea, Mr. Allen’s intellectual capacity
    is borderline, rated at seventy-five to eighty.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    age fourteen, Mr. Allen briefly went to
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Bowmanville
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    Training School.  After his release, he lived with his mother, to whom he
    claimed to be close, until her death in 1998.  During that time, he achieved
    a grade eight education.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the time of his guilty plea, Mr. Allen owned his own bus company.  He drove
    navy cadets and private school children to and from a variety of school and
    recreational activities.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Allen’s criminal conduct consists largely of what counsel characterized as “proximity
    seeking behaviour”.  He typically has engaged in manipulation and deceit
    to be close to pubescent boys, but he has rarely “acted out”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    two 1983 offences to which he pleaded guilty
    – indecent assault and gross indecency – occurred when Mr. Allen made two
    young boys, who worked for him in a video arcade, strip and stand naked to
    earn his trust. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    1999 offences occurred in the summer of that year when Mr. Allen met and
    became friendly with a group of five fourteen-year-old boys.  These boys
    often came to Mr. Allen’s apartment because he let them drink alcohol and
    smoke.  Mr. Allen told the boys that he was a member of the FBI, that the
    world was going to end in 2000, but that they could be saved by lying down
    with him while naked.  At separate times, the boys took off their clothes
    except for their underwear and lay down with Mr. Allen, who had also stripped
    down to his underwear.  The friendship ended with some horseplay during which
    Mr. Allen pointed a pellet gun at one of the boys and fired it.  He was arrested
    and incarcerated.  While in jail, he telephoned the home where one of the
    boys lived and told the boy’s father (who had answered the phone), “I’m going
    to burn your house down”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the dangerous offender application, the Crown led other evidence to show
    that Mr. Allen sought out pubescent boys.  In one case, he induced a fourteen-year-old
    boy – who was interested in an acting or modeling career – to come to
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    Toronto from
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Rochester on the pretext that he was an agent for young boys and worked for
    a company called “American Entertainment”.  The Crown also led evidence that
    Mr. Allen possessed child pornography: pictures on his computer of pubescent
    boys in their underwear, clothes or bathing suits, of nude males in their
    teens, and of boys engaged in sexual acts with adult males.  </p>
  <h2>C.        DANGEROUS OFFENDER AND LONG-TERM OFFENDER DESIGNATIONS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Under
    s. 753(1)(b) of the <i>Criminal</i> <i>Code</i>, a person may be declared
    a dangerous offender if that person is unable to control his or her sexual
    impulses and, as a result, will likely cause injury or harm to other persons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(1) The court may, on application made under this
    Part following the filing of an assessment report under subsection 752.1(2),
    find the offender to be a dangerous offender if it is satisfied</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(b) that the offence for which the offender
    has been convicted is a serious personal injury offence described in paragraph <i>(b)</i> of
    the definition of that expression in section 752 and the offender, by his
    or her conduct in any sexual matter including that involved in the commission
    of the offence for which he or she has been convicted, has shown a failure
    to control his or her sexual impulses and a likelihood of causing injury,
    pain or other evil to other persons through failure in the future to control
    his or her sexual impulses.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    752 of the <i>Criminal</i> <i>Code</i> defines
    “serious personal injury offence” to include a sexual assault.  Mr. Allen
    acknowledges that he meets the criteria in s. 753(1)(b) to be  declared a
    dangerous offender.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    dangerous offender declaration is perhaps the most serious punishment in
    the <i>Criminal</i> <i>Code</i>.   It is aimed at the prevention of future
    harm and the protection of the public.  Even where, however, the statutory
    criteria for a dangerous offender declaration have been met, a sentencing
    judge has discretion to declare a person a long-term offender and impose
    a term of imprisonment of two years or more followed by a community supervision
    order of up to ten years.  The sentencing judge may exercise this discretion
    if satisfied that imprisonment and community supervision would reduce the
    threat to the life, safety or well being of other persons to an acceptable
    level.  See <i>R. v. Johnson</i> (2003), 177 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.).  Section
    753(5) gives the court this discretion:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote> (5) If the court does not find an offender to be
    a dangerous offender,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(a)       the court may treat the application
    as an application to find the offender to be a long-term offender, section
    753.1 applies to the application and the court may either find that the offender
    is a long-term offender or hold another hearing for that purpose; or</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(b)       the court may impose sentence for
    the offence for which the offender has been convicted.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    753.1(1) sets out the criteria  for a long-term offender declaration:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(1) The court may, on application made under this
    Part following the filing of an assessment report under subsection 752.1(2),
    find an offender to be a long-term offender if it is satisfied that </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(a)       it would be appropriate to impose
    a sentence of imprisonment of two years or more for the offence for which
    the offender has been convicted;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(b)       there is a substantial risk that the
    offender will reoffend; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(c)       there is a reasonable possibility
    of eventual control of the risk in the community.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    in most of these kinds of appeals, the principal issue in this case is whether
    the trial judge erred in holding that there is no reasonable possibility
    of eventual control of Mr. Allen’s risk in the community.  In other words,
    the critical issue turns on the trial judge’s finding that Mr. Allen’s risk
    of reoffending cannot be managed in the community.</p>
  <h2>D.        ANALYSIS</h2>
  <h2>1)        Did the trial judge err in overstating the seriousness of Mr.
    Allen’s criminal conduct?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Allen concedes that although his sexual assaults arguably lie at the lower
    end of the scale of seriousness, they nonetheless may give rise to a dangerous
    offender declaration.  He must make this concession because, as the Supreme
    Court of Canada said in <i>R. v. Currie</i> (1997), 115 C.C.C. (3d) 205,
    once an offender has committed a serious personal injury offence as defined – as
    Mr. Allen has – the dangerous offender application is triggered without regard
    to the objective seriousness of the underlying offence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Where
    the relative seriousness of the offender’s criminal conduct may matter is
    in evaluating the offender’s future danger to the public.  Here, Mr. Allen
    argues that the trial judge overstated the seriousness of his conduct.  He
    makes two points.  He argues that his conduct was mainly
    “proximity seeking” – seeking the friendship of young boys – and only rarely
    has he actually committed sexual offences against children.  And, he also
    argues that the trial judge exaggerated the seriousness of his conduct by
    misapprehending three aspects of the evidence: the trial judge found Mr.
    Allen’s conduct was serious because he groomed young boys for sexual abuse,
    he used weapons to control young people when he did not get his way, and
    he encouraged homosexual behaviour between adults and children.  Mr. Allen
    contends that these three finding are not supported by the evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    do not propose to examine these alleged misapprehensions of the evidence,
    because even if made out they are peripheral to the disposition of this case.  Even
    if I were to accept Mr. Allen’s point, this would not materially lessen the
    seriousness of his conduct.  The underlying or predicate offences giving
    rise to the Crown’s application may be relatively minor compared to the conduct
    in question in many other dangerous offender applications.  But, sexual offences
    in any form against minors are serious. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Allen manipulated fourteen-year-old boys into thinking that in order to be
    saved when the world ended at the turn of the century, they had to strip
    to their underwear and lie in bed with a forty-two-year-old man also wearing
    only his underwear.  This is an intrusive sexual assault.  And, it is the
    kind of sexual assault that we in society cannot tolerate.  Mr. Allen has
    shown no remorse for his conduct and no understanding of its seriousness.  Moreover,
    even if society could accept some risk of this kind of offending conduct,
    we would have to have some assurance that this risk could be managed.  To
    this issue, the key issue on the appeal, I now turn.</p>
  <h2>2)        Did the trial judge misapprehend the evidence on whether Mr.
    Allen could be treated and whether his risk can be managed in the community?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge found as facts that the risk Mr. Allen would commit more sexual
    offences against eleven- to fourteen-year-old boys was very high and that
    there was no reasonable possibility of addressing that risk in the community.  Mr.
    Allen accepts that he is at a high risk to reoffend, but submits that he
    can be treated for his disorder by chemical castration drugs and that his
    risk can then be appropriately managed in the community by tight supervision.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    do not accept this submission.  The trial judge’s findings are supported
    by the evidence, especially the evidence of Dr. Klassen, a psychiatrist with
    the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, whom the Crown called in support
    of its application.  Dr. Klassen assessed Mr. Allen’s risk of reoffending
    if released in the community, and his amenability to treatment and community
    supervision.  He testified:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Allen was at a high risk to reoffend.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Chemical
    castration drugs to inhibit Mr. Allen’s sex drive would likely work, but
    Mr. Allen had shown no willingness to take these drugs.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If
    released into the community Mr. Allen would require supervision so strict
    as to amount to needing a personal chaperone.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>I will briefly elaborate on these
    three opinions.</p>
  <h2>a)         High risk to reoffend</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Klassen performed an actuarial risk assessment of Mr. Allen.  He relied on
    three different tests.  On the basis of these test results, Dr. Klassen was
    of the opinion that Mr. Allen had a high risk of reoffending.  On one of
    the tests, the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised, Mr. Allen scored twenty-nine.  According
    to Dr. Klassen, this score was
    “suggestive of significant treatment resistance, significant difficulties
    with community supervision, and [was] suggestive of substantial risk of reoffence
    in  and of itself.”</p>
  <h2><span style='"Times New Roman";'>b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Not
    amenable to treatment</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Klassen testified that those suffering from hebephilia can be treated.  Chemical
    castration drugs reduce the person’s sex drive and thus the impetus to act
    out.  There was, however, no evidence about whether Mr. Allen would be able
    to tolerate these drugs or how he would respond to them.  During the two
    years of the proceedings against him, he made no effort to try the drugs
    or be screened for them by an endocrinologist.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s real concern, however, was not about whether a particular drug
    would work on Mr. Allen, but about Mr. Allen’s unwillingness to take the
    drugs.  Dr. Klassen canvassed this question with Mr. Allen.  He concluded
    that Mr. Allen’s willingness to take the drugs was
    “virtually nil”.  Indeed, Mr. Allen said to Dr. Klassen, “I don’t care, you
    do damage to me and I sue you”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the application Mr. Allen’s counsel informed the court that his client was
    willing to take the drugs.  Mr. Allen then undermined his counsel’s position
    by accusing the Crown attorney of conspiring with other witnesses to put
    him in the position he was in.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the light of Mr. Allen’s complete rejection of treatment, I do not think
    that it is an answer to say – as his counsel submitted – that this court
    should recommend that the National Parole Board require he take drug treatment
    as a condition of his release.  Although the trial judge did not expressly
    address the possibility of a recommendation to the Board, his reasons show
    that such a recommendation would not be effective.  This court made the same
    point in <i>R. v. Grayer</i> (2007), 215 C.C.C. (3d) 505 at para. 64:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is apparent that the co-operation of the appellant
    would be essential if he was to be a candidate for drug treatment.  The appellant’s
    co-operation in arriving at his proper dosage and in assessing its side effects
    is required.  The trial judge stated that he accepted Dr. Klassen’s evidence
    that the appellant was hostile to authority.  He also found that the appellant’s “admission
    of guilt and desire to change [were] not sincere.”  In my view, if the trial
    judge had approached this matter on the basis that he could combine a long-term
    offender designation with a recommendation for mandatory drug treatment to
    the National Parole Board, as a condition of his release to the community,
    he would not have done so.  The trial judge’s findings show that such a recommendation
    would not likely be effective and is not justified.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>Because of Mr. Allen’s evident unwillingness
    to cooperate in taking sex-inhibiting drugs, a similar recommendation in
    this case would be futile.</p>
  <h2>c)         Risk cannot be managed in the community</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    dealing with whether Mr. Allen’s risk could be managed in the community,
    Dr. Klassen made three important observations: Mr. Allen was willing to work
    on the “margins of conventional society” by, for example, seeking out street
    children; Mr. Allen worked as a long distance bus driver; and, Mr. Allen
    is manipulative and deceitful, making any form of self-reporting meaningless.  These
    considerations demonstrate that community supervision of Mr. Allen would
    be exceptionally difficult.  Electronic monitoring is not an option because
    it has no tracking capability.  Dr. Klassen testified that in addition to
    taking the drugs, Mr. Allen needed a probation officer who would be able
    to act as a chaperone.  There was no evidence that this level of supervision
    was even reasonably possible.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Allen draws some comfort from Dr. Klassen’s ultimate opinion: that he was
    a “better fit” as a long-term offender.  There are two answers to this.  First,
    the trial judge was not required to accept Dr. Klassen’s ultimate opinion.  Second,
    and more important, Dr. Klassen’s opinion misapprehended the statutory test.  He
    explained why he thought the best fit for Mr. Allen was as a long-term offender
    in these words:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>To try to put it succinctly, I – I have real trouble
    with exactly how to define that phrase, reasonable possibility of eventual
    control of the risk in the community.  I – I think it – what it sort of suggests
    to me is that there’s <i>some hope that something can be done</i> to manage
    this individual in the community, and I – I think <i>interpreted broadly</i>,
    yes, I – I  think that Mr. Allen and what we know about Mr. Allen would fit
    with that.  [Emphasis added.] </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    test of course is not some vague hope of managing the risk in the community
    but a reasonable possibility of doing so.  That the trial judge was alive
    to the difference is evident from this passage in his reasons: “If there
    was any treatment possibility or something had been placed before this court
    beyond ‘hope’
    it might have given the court another alternative.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    record does seem to show that Mr. Allen suffers from mental deficiencies,
    which may reduce the level of his moral blameworthiness.  Nonetheless, the
    trial judge made no error in his assessment of whether Mr. Allen could be
    treated or whether his risk could presently be managed in the community.  </p>
  <h2>E.        CONCLUSION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s findings of fact are supported by the record.  He did not materially
    err in his appreciation of the evidence.  I would uphold his conclusion that
    Mr. Allen be declared a dangerous offender.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
