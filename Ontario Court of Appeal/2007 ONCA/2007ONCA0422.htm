    appellant Miller Paving Limited (“Miller”) contracted to supply aggregate
    materials to the respondent B. Gottardo Construction Ltd. (“Gottardo”), which
    then used the materials for a highway extension it had contracted to build
    for the owner of the highway. On December 20, 2001, Miller and Gottardo signed
    an agreement in which Miller acknowledged that it had been paid in full for
    all the materials it had supplied. Then, on January 31, 2002, it rendered
    a further invoice after discovering deliveries for which it had not billed
    Gottardo. Gottardo relied on the December 20 agreement to resist the claim,
    although Gottardo had itself been paid by the owner for most of these materials.</p>

    advanced its claim first on the basis of materials sold and delivered pursuant
    to its supply contract, and in the alternative, based on the doctrine of
    unjust enrichment. The trial judge found that the December 20 agreement stood
    as a complete bar to both, and concluded that the misapprehension as to the
    facts did not justify setting the contract aside.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    1999, Gottardo contracted with SLF Joint Venture (“SLF”), the owner of Highway
    407, to obtain and spread the aggregate materials required for an eight kilometre
    extension of the highway. Gottardo then contracted with Miller to supply
    the aggregate materials that it would use for the highway extension.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Gottardo
    paid Miller an agreed price per ton, and SLF paid Gottardo a higher price
    per ton, the difference covering Gottardo’s cost of placing, spreading and
    compacting the material.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    procedure used for the supply of material by Miller was that each load would
    be weighed at its pit. On delivery to the highway site, a Gottardo employee
    would sign the delivery ticket as accepted. One copy was kept by Miller,
    one by Gottardo and one was forwarded to SLF.</p>

    paid Gottardo on the basis of the accepted delivery tickets. For its part,
    Miller sent invoices to Gottardo on a regular basis and Gottardo’s accounts
    payables clerk, Ms. Sulcana, checked them against the delivery tickets and
    paid them subject to any variations she discovered. Up to the point of the
    disputed invoice, Gottardo had paid Miller more than $4,700,000 for more
    than 12,000 truckloads of material. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    highway extension project was completed in September 2001, and at SLF’s request,

    SLF.</p>

    delivered this release on October 4, 2001. Prior to doing so, Ms. Sulcana
    spoke to Miller’s credit manager three times, on September 3, September 19
    and October 2, to confirm that Miller had been fully paid by Gottardo. Subject
    to an outstanding balance owing of $190,528.17, Miller confirmed that this
    was so.</p>

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The contract agreement between <b>B. Gottardo Construction
      Ltd. (contractor)</b> and <b>Miller Paving Limited (supplier) </b>for the
      supply of granular materials on the above referenced project is now acknowledged
      as being completed in full. The supplier acknowledges and agrees that payment
      in full has been received for the materials supplied.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>This agreement is binding upon all parties as acknowledged

style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Then,
    in late January 2002, Miller discovered that, through inadvertence, it had
    failed to bill Gottardo for various loads of material delivered between June
    2001 and September 2001. As a result, it delivered an invoice to Gottardo
    for $480,603.95. At trial, the trial judge adjusted this amount downward
    to $448,669.64 based on a comparison with SLF’s figures. Accordingly, Miller
    has reduced its claim to the latter amount. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    first, Gottardo doubted that it had been paid by SLF for the material that
    is the subject of the disputed invoice. However, by the fall of 2002, it
    acknowledged that it had received payment from SLF for most of it.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge found as a fact that there was no reason for Gottardo to know
    of any outstanding amounts owed to Miller when the December 20 agreement
    was signed, nor ought it to have known. Miller acknowledged at trial that
    at the time of the December 20 agreement, it told Gottardo that it had paid
    all Miller’s accounts and that there were no more to come.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge also found that Miller’s failure to send the disputed invoice
    until early 2002 was due to a “gross oversight”
    that occurred within that company. Miller does not dispute this finding.
    At trial, it acknowledged that a single or series of internal processing
    failures led to the delay in invoicing, for reasons it simply did not know.
    Miller agreed that it was not asserting that Gottardo had any responsibility
    for the failure to invoice certain deliveries until January 2002.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    the trial judge found as a fact that the “windfall” funds received by Gottardo
    from SLF for these deliveries were expended by Gottardo in the purchase of
    equipment, thereby altering its position. There was ample evidence to support
    this finding, including that of Mr. Gottardo who testified that the purchases
    were made out of cash flows sourced from these funds and that the purchases
    would not otherwise have been made.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    dismissing Miller’s claim, the trial judge found that the December 20 agreement
    ought not to be set aside simply because of the misapprehension as to the
    facts, and that it was both a complete answer to any claim on the supply
    contract and a sufficient juristic reason to deny recovery for unjust enrichment,
    particularly given that Gottardo had altered its position after receiving
    the “windfall” funds.</p>
  <h4>ANALYSIS</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    central issue in this appeal is whether the trial judge erred in failing
    to apply the doctrine of common mistake to set aside the December 20 agreement.
    Miller candidly acknowledges that if the trial judge did not err, that contract
    prevents it from claiming on the subsequent invoice for goods sold and delivered,
    and also constitutes a juristic reason to deny recovery for unjust enrichment.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    can be no doubt that this is a case of common mistake. Miller and Gottardo
    reached an agreement on December 20, 2001 on the terms of their memorandum
    of release, but shared an error with respect to an important contextual circumstance,
    namely that all material supplied by Miller had been paid for by Gottardo.
    At the time, each thought that this was so. The question is whether in all
    the circumstances the contract should be set aside because of that common
    mistake. The court’s task in such circumstances has been aptly described
    by Professor John D. McCamus in “Mistaken Assumptions in Equity: Sound Doctrine
    or Chimera?” (2004) 40
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Can.</st1:country-region>
    Bus. L.J. 46 at  47:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In determining whether an agreement should be considered
    unenforceable by reason of the mistaken assumption that infects its creation,
    courts must engage in a delicate exercise of balancing the competing values
    of contractual stability and the provision of relief in cases of severe injustice.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    in other areas of law, the Canadian doctrine of common mistake has drawn
    heavily on its English antecedents. The two most important cases are the
    1932 decision of the House of Lords in <i>Bell v. Lever Brothers</i> <i> Ltd.</i>,<i> </i>[1932]
    A.C. 161, and the 1949 decision of the English Court of Appeal in <i>Solle
    v. Butcher</i>, [1950] 1 K.B. 671.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Bell</i> articulated the test for determining whether a contract is void
    for mistake at common law. The well known opinion of Atkin L.J. in that case
    is most often cited. His view was that for the doctrine to operate, it must
    be shown that the subject matter of the contract has become something essentially
    different from what it was believed to be. At p. 218, he said this:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Mistake as to quality of the thing contracted for
    raises more difficult questions. In such a case a mistake will not affect
    assent unless it is the mistake of both parties, and is as to the existence
    of some quality which makes the thing without the quality essentially different
    from the thing as it was believed to be. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Solle</i>,
    Denning L.J. developed the equitable jurisdiction to set aside as voidable
    contracts that might be found enforceable at common law. This allowed the
    court to relieve for common mistake when it would be “unconscientious” in
    all the circumstances to allow a contracting party to avail itself of the
    legal advantage it had obtained, and where this could be done without injustice
    to third parties. At p. 693, Denning L.J. put the equitable approach to common
    mistake this way:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A contract is also liable in equity to be set aside
    if the parties were under a common misapprehension either as to facts or
    as to their relative and respective rights, provided that the misapprehension
    was fundamental and that the party seeking to set it aside was not himself
    at fault.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    is well documented by Professor McCamus at p. 68 of his article, I think
    it is now undeniable that not just the common law doctrine of common mistake,
    but also the equitable doctrine, have been woven into the fabric of Canadian
    contract law. Indeed, in this appeal, neither party takes issue with that
    proposition.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    England, however, the decision of <i>Great Peace Shipping Ltd. v. Tsavliris
    Salvage (International) Ltd.</i>,<i> </i>[2003] Q.B. 679 (C.A.), may have
    changed things for that country. In that case, after a detailed analysis,
    the Court of Appeal was of the view that <i>Solle </i>could not stand with
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Bell</i><i> </i>and therefore should not be followed. In addition to apparently
    eliminating the equitable doctrine, the court also elaborated and restated
    the test for declaring a contract void at common law. At p. 703, the following
    is said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[T]he following elements must be present if common
    mistake is to avoid a contract:</p>

      Peace</i> appears not yet to have been adopted in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    and, in my view, there is good reason for not doing so. The loss of the flexibility
    needed to correct unjust results in widely diverse circumstances that would
    come from eliminating the equitable doctrine of common mistake would, I think,
    be a step backward. In his article, Professor McCamus makes a very effective
    case to this effect. However, I need not finally decide that question here
    because, as I will show, this case does not turn on the existence or non-existence
    of the equitable doctrine. Whether or not <i>Great Peace</i> is applied,
    the appellant would not succeed in setting aside the December 20 agreement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before
    turning to the application of any of these tests to the facts of this case,
    it must be noted that <i>Great Peace</i> does provide one useful reminder
    that is of significance here, whether or not its approach to common mistake
    is adopted in Canada. It is that in considering whether to apply the doctrine
    of common mistake either at common law or in equity, the court should look
    to the contract itself to see if the parties have provided for who bears
    the risk of the relevant mistake, because if they have, that will govern.
    See <i>Great Peace</i>, at p. 703.</p>

    my view, the December 20 “Memorandum of Release”
    as it is titled, is just such a contract. It clearly provides that it is
    the supplier that “acknowledges and agrees that payment in full has been
    received for the materials supplied.” Moreover, the billing practice here,
    as with most supply contracts, made it the responsibility of the supplier
    to determine what was owing for the material supplied and to then invoice
    for that amount. When the contract language is read in the context of this
    factual matrix, I conclude that the contract clearly allocates to Miller
    the risk that payment in full has not been received. I would therefore find
    that the December 20 agreement itself requires Miller to bear the consequence
    when that risk transpires, rather than allowing it to invoke the doctrine
    of common mistake. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    even if Miller can resort to the doctrine, I do not think it can succeed
    in setting aside the December 20 agreement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    to apply the common law approach found in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Bell</i>, Miller must show that as a result of the common mistake, the
    subject matter of the contract has become something essentially different
    from what it was believed to be. With the payment of $190,528.17 of the same
    date, that subject matter was the release of all further claims, as the title
    of the agreement clearly implies. Nothing about the mistaken assumption changes
    that subject matter. And, even if the <i>Great Peace</i> reformulation of
    the common law doctrine of common mistake were the law of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , Miller would still not prevail. Apart from anything else, it would be required
    to show that the non-existence of the presumed state of affairs was not its
    fault. For the reasons set out below, it cannot do so.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    to engage the equitable doctrine of common mistake as described in <i>Solle</i>,
    Miller must show that it was not at fault. The finding of the trial judge
    that the mistake was due to unexplained errors in Miller’s own procedures
    and was not in any way the responsibility of Gottardo makes this impossible.
    Then, if one were to add to the scales of equity the enrichment of Gottardo
    that resulted, this would be offset by the finding that, as a result of the
    overpayment, Gottardo altered its position. I would therefore conclude that,
    on the facts of this case, the court ought not to use its equitable jurisdiction
    to set aside the December 20 contract for common mistake. It is not unjust
    for Gottardo to avail itself of the legal advantage it obtained.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    summary, I conclude that the December 20 agreement itself precludes Miller
    from resorting to the doctrine of common mistake, but that even if it could
    do so, neither the common law doctrine nor the equitable doctrine of common
    mistake would result in the contract being set aside. Hence, Miller’s claim
    must fail whether based on the claim for materials supplied or on the doctrine
    of unjust enrichment because the December 20 agreement stands in its way.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appeal must therefore be dismissed, with costs to the respondent Gottardo
    fixed at $15,000 inclusive of disbursements and GST. I would conclude by
    thanking both counsel for their able submissions.</p>
