  <h2>A.        OVERVIEW</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    plaintiff, Prudential Securities Credit Corp., LLC, claimed against Robert
    Laba on a guarantee, and against Robert Laba and his wife, Angela Laba, on
    the ground that Robert’s transfer of his interest in two properties to Angela
    were fraudulent conveyances and thus void under s. 2 of the <i>Fraudulent
    Conveyances Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.29.  The action was tried by a judge
    alone.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the end of Prudential’s case, both Robert Laba and Angela Laba brought motions
    for a non-suit and elected to call no evidence.  The trial judge dismissed
    Robert Laba’s motion and granted Angela Laba’s motion, with reasons to follow.  Later,
    and without hearing further submissions, he delivered reasons granting Prudential
    judgment against Robert Laba on his guarantee in the amount of its claim
    (US $639,348.32 and Can $600.00, together with prejudgment interest of US
    $139,189.45), and dismissing Prudential’s claim against Angela Laba.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Both
    Robert Laba and Prudential have appealed.  On his appeal, Robert Laba makes
    a single submission: the trial judge failed to give him an opportunity to
    make closing argument.  Robert Laba submits that this failure amounted to
    a miscarriage of justice and must be remedied by a new trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    its appeal, Prudential submits that in dismissing its action against Angela
    Laba, the trial judge made three errors.  First, he applied the wrong legal
    test on a non-suit motion.  Second, he applied the wrong test for establishing
    a fraudulent conveyance.  And third, he failed to properly assess the evidence
    in support of Prudential’s claim.</p>
  <h2>B.        BACKGROUND FACTS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    1996, Robert Laba became the chief financial officer and a 50 per cent shareholder
    in T.B. Extreme Foods Limited.  Over the next three years, T.B. Extreme acquired
    twenty-six Taco Bell franchises.  In 1999, the defendant, Cobrand Foods Ltd.
    was incorporated to acquire additional Taco Bell franchises.  Robert Laba
    became the chief financial officer and a director of Cobrand.  He was sued
    on a written guarantee that he gave in connection with a loan from Captec
    Financial Group Inc. to Cobrand.  Prudential is Captec’s assignee.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Captec
    was in the business of making loans to franchised restaurant operators for
    the purchase of restaurant equipment.  In November 1999, Captec agreed to
    finance Cobrand’s purchase of equipment for a Taco Bell / Pizza Hut restaurant
    in
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto.  In April 2000, Captec advanced the loan in the amount of US $523,680.00,
    and Cobrand gave Captec a promissory note and security over the equipment.  Robert
    Laba guaranteed payment of Cobrand’s debts and liabilities in respect of
    the Captec loan. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    March 2001, Cobrand defaulted on the loan.  In February 2002, Prudential
    began this action.  It obtained a default judgment against Cobrand, and proceeded
    to trial against Robert and Angela Laba.</p>
  <h2>C.        ANALYSIS</h2>
  <h2>I.          Robert Laba’s Appeal</h2>
  <h2>1)        Did the trial judge’s failure to give Robert Laba an opportunity
    to make closing argument amount to a miscarriage of justice? </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    non-suit motions were argued over two and a half days in late July 2004.  The
    trial judge reserved his decision on the motions.  Before adjourning court,
    however, he advised counsel that if the non-suit motions were unsuccessful
    they should be ready to re-attend for closing argument.  On July 30, 2004,
    the trial judge issued a brief endorsement.  He dismissed Robert Laba’s non-suit
    motion and granted Angela Laba’s motion, and said, “Written reasons with
    respect to both motions will follow.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge apparently forgot about reconvening for final argument.  Instead,
    on March 29, 2005, he delivered written reasons in which he not only explained
    his decision on the non-suit motions, but also went farther, granting judgment
    against Robert Laba and dismissing the action against Angela Laba.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    finding Robert Laba liable on his guarantee, the trial judge said at para.
    35 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[35] For the foregoing reasons, I am satisfied that
    the plaintiff has raised a <i>prima facie</i> case.  Accordingly, the motion
    for non-suit must be dismissed.  In fact, as set out above, I am satisfied
    that the plaintiff has established well beyond a balance of probabilities
    that Robert Laba is liable on the Guarantee.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Robert
    Laba submits that the right to make closing argument is a substantive right,
    essential to a fair trial.  As he was deprived of this right, albeit inadvertently,
    he was denied the opportunity to fully present his case.  He points out that
    though he presented argument on the non-suit motion, a plaintiff’s burden
    to defeat a non-suit differs from and is less onerous than its burden to
    obtain judgment on its claim.  Thus, Robert Laba contends that the result
    of being denied the right to make closing argument amounts to a miscarriage
    of justice, which can be remedied only by an order for a new trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before
    addressing Robert Laba’s submission, I want to say a few words about non-suit
    motions in civil non-jury trials.  The term “non-suit” refers to a motion
    brought by the defendant at the close of the plaintiff’s evidence to dismiss
    the action on the ground that the plaintiff has failed to make out a case
    for the defendant to answer.  Neither the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. C.43, nor the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> specifically provides
    for non-suit motions, but judges continue to have a recognized jurisdiction
    to entertain these motions.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Still,
    I question whether in this province a non-suit motion in a civil non-jury
    trial has much value.  In
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario, when a defendant moves for a non-suit, the defendant must elect
    whether to call evidence.  See <i>Ontario v. Ontario Public Service Employees
    Union (OPSEU)</i> (1990), 37 O.A.C. 218 at para. 40 (
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Div. Ct.).  If the defendant elects to call evidence, the judge reserves
    on the motion until the end of the case.  If the defendant elects to call
    no evidence – as Robert Laba elected in this case – then the judge rules
    on the motion immediately after it has been made.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    non-suit motion adds to the time and expense of a trial.  And because of
    the election requirement, it has little practical value.  Perhaps a defendant
    bringing the motion sees a tactical advantage in being able to argue first.  To
    succeed on the motion, however, the defendant must show that the plaintiff
    has put forward no case to answer, in most lawsuits an onerous task.  Why
    not simply take on the less onerous task of showing that the plaintiff’s
    claim should fail?  It is small wonder that most commentators consider that
    in civil judge alone trials, non-suit motions gain little and are becoming
    obsolete.  See <i>Phipson on Evidence</i>, 16th ed. (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
    2005) at 274, and John Sopinka, Donald B. Houston &amp; Melanie Sopinka, <i>The
    Trial of an Action</i>, 2d ed. (Toronto: Butterworths Canada, 1999) at 151-52.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, I agree with Robert Laba on three points.  First, as my discussion
    above signals, Prudential’s burden on the non-suit motion differed from and
    was less onerous than its burden to obtain judgment on its claim.  To defeat
    the non-suit motion, Prudential had to satisfy the trial judge that it had
    put forward a <i>prima</i> <i>facie</i> case – that it had put forward evidence,
    which, if believed, would allow the trial judge to decide in its favour.  To
    obtain judgment, Prudential, of course, had to establish its claim on a balance
    of probabilities.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    I agree with Robert Laba that the opportunity to make closing argument is
    a substantive right.  And third, I agree that though he did so inadvertently
    and not deliberately, the trial judge erred in depriving Robert Laba of that
    opportunity.  Because of this error, Robert Laba asks for a new trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Not
    every error by a trial judge entitles an aggrieved party to a new trial.  Section
    134(6) of the <i>Courts</i> <i>of</i> <i>Justice</i> <i>Act</i> stipulates
    that this court should order a new trial only where “some substantial wrong
    or miscarriage of justice has occurred.”  This stringent standard reflects
    the underlying policy that new trials ordinarily are contrary to the public
    interest.  New trials cause increased costs or wasted costs as well as delay
    in resolving disputes, and are therefore to be avoided unless plainly required
    by the interests of justice.  See <i>Arland</i> <i>and</i> <i>Arland v.
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Taylor</i>, [1955] O.R. 131 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    the narrow question on this appeal is whether the trial judge’s failure to
    give Robert Laba an opportunity to make a closing argument caused a miscarriage
    of justice.  I would answer that question, no.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    are decisions of this court standing for the proposition that a litigant
    has a substantive right to present closing argument, and where that right
    is denied, we should order a new trial.  The main case, followed many times,
    is <i>Felker v. Felker</i>, [1946] O.W.N. 368 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  In that case, this court held that the defendant was deprived of her
    substantive right to have her case fully presented because the trial judge
    gave judgment without giving her an opportunity to present argument.  The
    court ordered a new trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the appeal before us, I come to a different conclusion.  In doing so, I do
    not intend in any way to depart from <i>Felker</i> and its progeny.   But,
    as is invariably the case, context matters.  Here, the context includes three
    important considerations.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    Robert Laba cannot say that he had no opportunity to present argument after
    all the evidence was in.  To the contrary, he fully argued over the course
    of two and a half days all the defences to the guarantee available to him.  Although
    he did so on his non-suit motion instead of in final argument, he nonetheless
    had an opportunity to fully present his side of the case.  It seems to me
    that is all <i>Felker</i> requires.  Indeed, the trial judge’s reasons show
    that even on the non-suit motion, Robert Laba argued Prudential had not established
    its claim against him on a balance of probabilities.  At para. 25 of his
    reasons, the trial judge set out Robert Laba’s principal argument: “The principal
    argument of the defendant is that the plaintiff has failed to prove, on a
    balance of probabilities, that the Guarantee relates to the Loan.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    and critically important, Robert Laba has not shown that if he had been given
    an opportunity to make closing argument, the result would have been different.  On
    appeal, his trial counsel filed an affidavit stating that he expected to
    have the opportunity to make closing submissions.  But, his affidavit is
    silent on any new arguments that he might have presented.  </p>

    his factum on appeal, Robert Laba raised but one defence: his guarantee was
    meant to be an “interim measure”, to end once the landlord of the restaurant
    premises agreed – as it eventually did – to subordinate its interest in Cobrand’s
    equipment to that of Captec.  This defence was not even pressed at trial,
    and was quickly and correctly disposed of by the trial judge at para. 13
    of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[13] While Robert Laba has pleaded that he understood
    the Guarantee to be effective only until the landlord waiver issue was finalized
    to the satisfaction of Captec, this was not seriously argued at trial and
    there is no evidence to support this position.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    when the trial judge released his reasons granting judgment, Robert Laba
    did not write to him or go back to him to complain that he had been prejudiced
    in any way by being deprived of the opportunity to make closing argument.</p>

    the light of these considerations, I am not persuaded that a miscarriage
    of justice has occurred.  Had Robert Laba been given the opportunity to present
    a closing argument, I am not satisfied that the result would have been different.  I
    would dismiss his appeal.</p>
  <h2>II.        Prudential’s Appeal</h2>
  <h2>1)        Did the trial judge apply the wrong test on Angela Laba’s non-suit
    motion?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    October 2000, Robert Laba transferred his interest in two properties to his
    wife, Angela.  In its action, Prudential alleged that the transfers were
    void because they were made with intent to defeat its claim as creditor,
    contrary to s. 2 of the <i>Fraudulent Conveyances Act</i>.  Section 2 states:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Every conveyance of real property or personal property
    and every bond, suit, judgment and execution heretofore or hereafter made
    with intent to defeat, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or others of their
    just and lawful actions, suits, debts, accounts, damages, penalties or forfeitures
    are void as against such persons and their assigns.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the end of Prudential’s case, Angela Laba moved for a non-suit, which the
    trial judge granted.  Prudential submits that by doing so the trial judge
    applied the wrong test.  The factual background of this submission is briefly
    as follows.</p>

    I have said, Robert Laba was a 50 per cent shareholder in T.B. Extreme.  T.B.
    Extreme’s lender was the Royal Bank of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place

      Canada</st1:country-region>
    (“RBC”).  In May 1998, Robert Laba gave RBC a personal guarantee of T.B.
    Extreme’s indebtedness limited to $1 million.  By 1999, T.B. Extreme was
    in financial difficulty.  In April 2000, Robert Laba gave Captec his personal
    guarantee of Cobrand’s indebtedness.</p>

    the time he gave these two guarantees, Robert Laba had an interest in two
    properties.  He held a 50 per cent interest in the matrimonial home at

    the summer of 2000, because of T.B. Extreme’s financial difficulties, RBC
    asked for additional security and threatened to put in a monitor.  In July
    2000, the Labas entered into a transfer agreement in which Angela consented
    to a $500,000 mortgage in favour of RBC on a property at

    February 2001, T.B. Extreme was assigned into bankruptcy.  RBC claimed against

    para. 61 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[61] The plaintiff says Robert Laba conveyed the

    trial judge nonetheless granted Angela Laba’s motion.  He concluded, at para.
    71, that the “badges of fraud do not, on a balance of probabilities, evidence
    fraud when considered against the background of the purpose of the Transfer
    Agreement.”  According to the trial judge, at para. 69, “it is at least as
    likely that the Transfer Agreement and the transfers of the Properties were
    entered into by Robert Laba with a view to having 122 grant the RBC Mortgage
    in favour of RBC, one of his two creditors, rather than with an intent to
    defeat, hinder, delay or defraud his creditors.”  </p>

    submits that the trial judge applied the wrong test on the non-suit motion.  It
    argues that the trial judge should not have weighed the competing inferences
    available from the evidence to determine whether fraud had been established
    on a balance of probabilities.  Instead, he should simply have determined
    whether Prudential’s evidence, assuming it was believed, made out a <i>prima</i> <i>facie</i> case,
    a case for Angela Laba to answer.  I agree with this submission.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    a non-suit motion, the trial judge undertakes a limited inquiry.  Two relevant
    principles that guide this inquiry are these.  First, if a plaintiff puts
    forward some evidence on all elements of its claim, the judge must dismiss
    the motion.  Second, in assessing whether a plaintiff has made out a <i>prima</i> <i>facie</i> case,
    the judge must assume the evidence to be true and must assign “the most favourable
    meaning” to evidence capable of giving rise to competing inferences.  This
    court discussed this latter principle in <i>Hall et al.  v. Pemberton</i> (1974),
    5 O.R. (2d) 438 at 438-9, quoting <i>Parfitt v. Lawless</i> (1872), 41 L.J.P. &amp; M.
    68 at 71-72:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I conceive, therefore, that in judging whether there
    is in any case evidence for a jury the Judge must weigh the evidence given,
    must assign what he conceives to be the most favourable meaning which can
    reasonably be attributed to any ambiguous statements, and determine on the
    whole what tendency the evidence has to establish the issue. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>From every fact that is proved, legitimate and reasonable
    inferences may of course be drawn, and all that is fairly deducible from
    the evidence is as much proved, for the purpose of a <i>prima</i> <i>facie</i> case,
    as if it had been proved directly.  I conceive, therefore, that in discussing
    whether there is in any case evidence to go to the jury, what the Court has
    to consider is this, whether, assuming the evidence to be true, and adding
    to the direct proof all such inferences of fact as in the exercise of a reasonable
    intelligence the jury would be warranted in drawing from it, there is sufficient
    to support the issue. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    other words, on a non-suit motion the trial judge should not determine whether
    the competing inferences available to the defendant on the evidence rebut
    the plaintiff’s <i>prima</i> <i>facie</i> case.  The trial judge should make
    that determination at the end of the trial, not on the non-suit motion.  See

    granting Angela Laba’s motion, the trial judge went beyond his limited mandate
    and failed to apply either of the two principles set out above.  Ordinarily,
    where an appellate court reverses a decision to grant a non-suit in a judge
    alone trial, a new trial is ordered.  Prudential, however, does not want
    a new trial.  Instead, it wants this court to decide whether the trial judge
    erred in concluding that it had not established that the transfers were fraudulent
    conveyances.  Furthermore, although Prudential does request, in the alternative,
    that the case be sent back for a new trial, in my view, that remedy is not
    warranted as the trial judge’s reasons provide a sufficient basis for this
    court to determine the merits of Prudential’s action.</p>
  <h2>2)        Did the trial judge apply the wrong test for establishing a fraudulent
    conveyance claim?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Prudential
    submits that by putting the onus on it to establish fraud on a balance of
    probabilities, the trial judge applied the wrong test.  Prudential argues
    that the trial judge should have engaged in a two-step analysis.  First,
    he should have concluded that the
    “badges of fraud”, on which Prudential relied, gave rise to an inference
    of fraud and that that inference then put a “burden of explanation” on Angela
    Laba to show that her husband did not act with an intent to defeat his creditors.  See <i>Rinaldo
    v. Rosenfeld (Trustee of)</i>, [2001] O.J. No. 4189 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  Second, as neither Robert nor Angela Laba put forward any evidence to
    meet their burden, the trial judge should have found that Prudential was
    entitled to a judgment against Angela Laba and declared the transfers void.  I
    do not accept Prudential’s submission.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    crucial question in any fraudulent conveyance action is whether the plaintiff
    has proved the fraudulent intent of the debtor.  While the legal burden to
    prove fraudulent intent remains on the plaintiff throughout the trial, the
    plaintiff can raise an inference of fraud sufficient to put a “burden of
    explanation”
    on the defendant debtor.  The plaintiff typically raises an inference of
    fraud by putting forward “badges of fraud.”  These “badges of fraud” vary
    from case to case.  They are no more than typical and suspicious facts that
    may allow the court to make a finding of fraud absent an explanation from
    the debtor.  See C.R.B. Dunlop,<i> Creditor-Debtor Law in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">

style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    court, however, is not compelled to draw this inference of fraudulent intent
    from badges of fraud pleaded by the plaintiff.  See <i>Koop v. Smith</i> (1915),
    51 S.C.R. 554 at 558-59.  The court may dismiss a fraudulent conveyance action
    because it has decided that the surrounding circumstances taken as a whole
    explain away the plaintiff’s evidence.  It seems to me that is what the trial
    judge did in this case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is clear from his reasons that the trial judge was well aware that it was
    within his discretion to draw an inference of fraudulent intent from Prudential’s
    alleged badges of fraud.  Unfortunately, the trial judge’s reasons are not
    entirely clear on whether he drew this inference.  One or two paragraphs
    in his judgment suggest that he did.  On balance, however, on my reading
    of his reasons, it appears that the trial judge decided not to draw an inference
    of fraudulent intent and thus not to place the “burden of explanation” on
    Angela Laba.  Instead, he decided Prudential’s claim on the basis it had
    the burden of proof to establish a fraudulent conveyance on a balance of
    probabilities and did not have the benefit of an inference of fraudulent
    intent.  He looked at all the circumstances surrounding the badges of fraud
    and drew inferences that explained away Prudential’s evidence.  He therefore
    concluded that Prudential had not made out its case.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    example, at para. 69 of his reasons, in a passage I have already quoted,
    he said, “it is at least as likely” that the transfers were made to facilitate
    the RBC mortgage rather than to defeat his creditors.  Implicitly, he concluded
    Prudential did not establish a fraudulent intent on a balance of probabilities.  Also,
    at para. 71, he found,
    “the facts which the plaintiff submits represents badges of fraud do not,
    on a balance of probabilities, evidence fraud.”  Again, he determined that
    Prudential failed to meet its burden.  And, more importantly, in several
    paragraphs, which I discuss below, the trial judge rejected a number of the
    badges of fraud alleged by Prudential.  In my view, these passages demonstrate,
    as in <i>Rinaldo</i>, <i>supra</i>, that the trial judge concluded, in the
    circumstances before him, that Prudential had not met the threshold necessary
    to put the burden of explanation on Angela Laba.  In my view, it was open
    to him to do so.</p>

    the next section of these reasons, I discuss the inferences that the trial
    judge did draw.  On this ground of appeal, it is sufficient to say that the
    trial judge did not and was entitled not to draw the permissive inference
    of fraudulent intent.  I am therefore not persuaded that he applied the wrong
    test for establishing a fraudulent conveyance.</p>

    accepting that it had the burden throughout to establish that the transfers

    to this contention is Prudential’s submission that, as the entire fraudulent

    the relevant evidence in this case is written, Prudential submits that this
    court may make its own findings of fact and draw its own inferences without
    giving any deference to the trial judge.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span

    ).  The principle of appellate deference to a trial judge’s fact-finding
    and inference-drawing applies even when the entire trial record is in writing.  That
    is so because the principle of deference is grounded in more than a trial
    judge’s ability to see and hear the witnesses.  Deference recognizes that
    even on a written record, the trial judge
    “lives through” the trial while a court of appeal reviews the record only
    through the lens of appellate review.  Deference also preserves the integrity
    of the trial process, maintains the confidence of litigants in that process,
    reduces the number and length of appeals and therefore, the cost of litigation,
    and appropriately presumes that trial judges are just as competent as appellate
    judges to resolve disputes justly.   </p>

    principle of deference, therefore, applies to the trial judge’s finding that
    Prudential failed to establish that the transfers were fraudulent.  That

    drawing those inferences, the trial judge rejected as evidence of fraudulent

    example, at para. 66 of his reasons, the trial judge refused to infer that
    Robert Laba selected
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    10 Hillview Crescent to defeat his creditors.  Instead, he inferred that
    RBC selected the security on
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    10 Hillview Crescent for reasons that do not impeach the transfers.  At para.
    73, the trial judge also drew the inference that Angela Laba would not have
    consented to the RBC mortgage if she had not received consideration roughly
    equal in value to the equity in 10 Hillview Crescent.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>And,
    faced with a choice of whether the transfers showed an intent to defeat creditors
    or an attempt to meet the demands of T.B. Extreme’s lender, at para. 69,
    the trial judge drew the inference that the latter was at least as likely
    as the former.  Prudential contends that favouring one creditor over another
    amounted to a fraudulent conveyance under s. 2 of the <i>Fraudulent Conveyances
    Act</i>.  Although this court has held that this statute may apply to conveyances
    made for the benefit of other creditors, the trial judge correctly concluded
    that s. 2 requires a fraudulent intent on the part of the debtor regardless
    of whether one creditor is “favoured” over another.  See <i>Optical Recording
    Laboratories Inc. v. Digital Recording Corp.</i> (1990), 1 O.R. (3d) 131
    at 139 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  He refused to find that intent in this case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    at para. 72, the trial judge refused to draw an inference of fraud either
    from the mere fact that Robert and Angela Laba were husband and wife or from
    the fact that she later permitted him to take some of the mortgage proceeds
    on the matrimonial home at 4 Lyon Court for his personal use.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    the only question on this branch of the appeal is whether the inferences
    drawn by the trial judge on which he based his ultimate finding are supported
    by the evidence or, I might add, by the absence of evidence put forward by
    Prudential.  See <i>H.L</i>., <i>supra</i>, at para. 74.   In my view, they
    are.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    the transfers took place, neither Robert Laba nor Cobrand was insolvent.  Neither
    was in breach of any obligation to Captec.  The transfers themselves gave
    RBC access to about the same amount of security as it would have had access
    to if Robert Laba had not conveyed the two properties to his wife.  Prudential
    led no evidence to show or suggest that Angela Laba would have consented
    to the mortgage on
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    10 Hillview Crescent even if she had received nothing in return.  And, Prudential
    led no evidence to show that Robert and Angela Laba chose
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    10 Hillview Crescent with a view to defeating his creditors.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge found that the badges of fraud put forward by Prudential did
    not establish a fraudulent intent on a balance of probabilities.  In the
    light of the record before him, I do not think that the trial judge committed
    a palpable and overriding error in so finding.  I would dismiss Prudential’s
    appeal.</p>
  <h2>D.        CONCLUSION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would dismiss both Robert Laba’s appeal and Prudential’s appeal.  Although
    the trial judge erred by not giving Robert Laba an opportunity to make a
    closing argument, in the context of this case, I do not think that this error
    caused a miscarriage of justice. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge also erred by going beyond his limited mandate on Angela Laba’s
    non-suit motion.  However, in dismissing the action against her, he applied
    the correct legal test and drew inferences that are reasonably supported
    by the record.</p>

    is entitled to the costs of Robert Laba’s appeal, which I would fix in the
    amount of $6,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST.  Angela Laba is entitled
    to the costs of Prudential’s appeal.  I would also fix those costs in the
    amount of $6,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST, but I would then deduct
    $1,000 for Angela Laba’s abandoned cross-appeal on costs.  Angela Laba is
    therefore entitled to $5,000 in costs.</p>
