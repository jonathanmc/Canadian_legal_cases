    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Russia</st1:country-region>
    in 1974. During 2003, they lived together in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario for about 6 months. In July 2003, Mr. Okmyansky returned to
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Russia</st1:country-region>
    and applied for a divorce. After the divorce was granted, Ms. Okmyansky commenced
    this application, claiming support under the <i>Divorce Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985,
    c. 3 (2<sup>nd</sup> Supp.) or the <i>Family Law Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.
    F. 3, and a division of assets under the <i>Family Law Act</i>.</p>

    Okmyansky challenged the jurisdiction of the
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario courts to entertain Ms. Okmyansky’s application. Following a trial
    of the preliminary issue of jurisdiction, Paisley J. concluded that the Russian
    divorce decree is valid in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario. However, he also found that the parties’ last common habitual residence
    was in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario and that it would therefore not be appropriate to stay Ms. Okmyansky’s

    Okmyansky appeals the trial judge’s decision not to stay the application.
    He contends that, in the face of the Russian divorce, there is no jurisdiction
    under the <i>Divorce Act</i> or the <i>Family Law Act</i> to grant the relief
    Ms. Okmyansky has requested. He raises the following issues on appeal:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:

    in July 2003 and applied for a divorce. Ms. Okmyansky received notice of
    the divorce proceedings and retained a Russian lawyer to represent her. The
    divorce was granted by a Russian court on February 26, 2004, and came into
    force on May 12, 2004. On August 30, 2004, at Mr. Okmyansky’s request, a
    Russian court determined that each of the parties holds a one half interest
    in a
    <st1:City

    the divorce, Ms. Okmyansky commenced this application on August 18, 2004.
    In addition to her claims for support and equalization of assets, she also
    claimed relief relating to the

    response to Ms. Okmyansky’s application, Mr. Okmyansky brought a motion under
    Rule 17 of the<i> Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194 disputing
    the jurisdiction of the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario courts to entertain this proceeding and requesting that service of
    the originating process out of the jurisdiction be set aside and that the
    application be stayed. He relied on his Russian divorce and claimed that
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Russia</st1:country-region>
    is the proper forum for this action. In the alternative, he claimed that
    Ms. Okmyansky is “statute barred” from obtaining the relief she requested
    because the parties were validly divorced in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Russia</st1:country-region>
    , the issue of property division was adjudicated by the Russian courts and
    the parties’ last common domicile was

    February 21, 2005, Backhouse J. held that Mr. Okmyansky’s motion could not
    be determined on a paper record and would have to be dealt with at a trial.
    She also directed that Mr. Okmyansky deliver an answer and financial statement
    so that the substantive issues could be addressed at trial if the court found
    that it had jurisdiction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.

    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court for leave to appeal the February 21, 2005 order. On June
    30, 2005, Sachs J. made a consent order varying the February order by directing
    that “[t]he issue of the jurisdiction of the Ontario Court over the matters
    raised [in this proceeding] and the related sub-issues (validity of foreign
    divorce and last common habitual residence of the parties) shall proceed

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>III. The Trial Judge’s
      Reasons</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial concerning jurisdiction proceeded in October 2006. The trial judge
    found that the parties occupied their
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto condominium as a common habitual residence and that
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario was their last common habitual residence. However, he also concluded
    that Mr. Okmyansky had a real and substantial connection to
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Russia</st1:country-region>
    at the time he applied for the divorce and that Mr. Okmyansky did not choose
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Russia</st1:country-region>
    as the forum for the divorce based on any oblique motive. The trial judge
    therefore held that the Russian divorce decree is valid in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    stating that those findings answered “the questions that were directed for
    resolution by the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court”, the trial judge said the question of whether Ms. Okmyansky
    could pursue property claims under the <i>Family Law Act</i> in the face
    of the Russian divorce was “an issue of law which should only be decided
    with a proper factual foundation.” He also said, “[I]t would be unfair to
    [Ms. Okmyansky] to stay the application in that [her] position through her
    counsel was that the jurisdictional issues were limited to those referred
    to in the order of the Divisional Court.” When pressed by counsel for clarification,
    the trial judge responded that his ruling made it clear that
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario has jurisdiction to deal with the property and support issues, but
    that he would make no comment on the merit of those claims.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    order to determine the issues on appeal, it is necessary to review the sections
    of the <i>Divorce Act</i> dealing with jurisdiction in all three types of
    proceedings that are available under the Act (a divorce proceeding, a corollary
    relief proceeding and a variation proceeding) and to also consider certain
    sections of the Act dealing with support and variation orders. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    essence, the <i>Divorce Act</i> provides that a court has jurisdiction to
    entertain a divorce proceeding where either spouse has been ordinarily resident
    in the province for one year prior to commencing the proceeding. In relation
    to both corollary relief and variation proceedings it is only necessary that
    one of the spouses reside in the province where the application is made.
    Significantly, in relation to variation proceedings, the <i>Divorce Act</i> makes
    it clear that a court only has power to vary corollary relief orders made
    under the Act. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sections of the <i>Divorce Act</i> that are relevant to the support claim

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>2. (1) In this Act,</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>“corollary relief proceeding” means
    a proceeding in a court in which either or both former spouses seek a child-support

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>“custody order” means an
    order made under subsection 16(1);</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>“divorce proceeding” means
    a proceeding in a court in which either or both spouses seek a divorce order
    alone or together with a child-support order, a spousal support order or
    a custody order;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>“spouse”
    means either of two persons who are married to each other;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>“spousal support order” means
    an order made under subsection 15.2 (1);</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>“support order” means a
    child support order or a spousal support order;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>“variation order” means
    an order made under subsection 17 (1);</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>“variation proceeding” means
    a proceeding in a court in which either or both former spouses seek a variation
    order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>3. (1) A court in a province
    has jurisdiction to hear and determine a divorce proceeding if either spouse
    has been ordinarily resident in the province for a least one year immediately
    preceding the commencement of the proceeding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>4. (1) A court in a province
    has jurisdiction to hear and determine a corollary relief proceeding if</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>(a) either former spouse
    is ordinarily resident in the province at the commencement of the proceeding;

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>(b) both former spouses
    accept the jurisdiction of the court.</p>

      <st1:place w:st="on">
      South Africa</st1:country-region>
    . Their final order of divorce incorporated terms on which the parties had
    settled various issues, including spousal support. In 1990, the Rothgiessers
    consented to an order in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario increasing the amount of spousal support payable to the former wife.
    Subsequently, in 1998, the former husband brought a variation application
    under the <i>Divorce Act</i>, requesting that spousal support for his former
    wife be terminated. On the appeal from the order terminating spousal support,
    this court concluded that the 1990 spousal support order was a nullity. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    particular, this court found that the 1990 spousal support order could not
    have been made under the <i>Family Law Act</i>, as the parties were not spouses
    as required by that Act at the time the 1990 spousal support order was made.
    Further, this court held that a Canadian court had no jurisdiction under
    the <i>Divorce Act</i> to make the 1990 spousal support order either by way
    of a corollary relief proceeding or by way of a variation proceeding given
    the foreign divorce. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court’s conclusion in<i> Rothgiesser v. Rothgiesser</i>, <i>supra</i>, concerning
    the jurisdiction to make a corollary relief order under the <i>Divorce Act</i> in
    the face of a foreign divorce was premised on the wording of s. 4 of the <i>Divorce
    Act </i>in 1990<i>, i.e., </i>only the court that granted the divorce had
    jurisdiction to hear a corollary proceeding. However, at paras. 58-59, this
    court went on to consider the wording of the current version of s. 4 (which
    provides a court has jurisdiction to hear a corollary relief proceeding where
    either spouse is ordinarily resident in the province) and concluded that
    the current version of s. 4 does not give Canadian courts jurisdiction “to
    deal with support obligations in the absence of a Canadian divorce”:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>In these reasons, I referred
    to s. 4 of the<i> Divorce Act</i> as it read in 1990 at the time of the [1990
    support] order. I also mentioned that s. 4 was amended as of March 25, 1993.
    I repeat this section as it read prior to and since the amendment:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>4. A court has jurisdiction
    to hear and determine a corollary relief proceeding if the court has granted
    a divorce to either or both former spouses.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>4 (1) A court in a province
    has jurisdiction to hear and determine a corollary relief proceeding if</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>(a) either former spouse
    is ordinarily resident in the province at the commencement of the proceeding;
    or</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>(b) both former spouses
    accept the jurisdiction of the court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>In his textbook earlier
    referred to [<i>Payne on Divorce</i>, 4<sup>th</sup> ed. (Toronto: Carswell,
    1996)], Professor Payne wrote that the amendment “appears sufficiently broad
    to enable a foreign divorcee to institute proceedings for support and custody
    under sections 15 and 16 of the Act, if he or she has established ordinarily
    residence in a Canadian province.” The implication of this view is great
    and thus merits correction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>In my view, the amendment
    did no such thing. Whereas Parliament had previously limited jurisdiction
    to the court that had granted the divorce, the amendment extended the jurisdiction
    by authorising a Canadian court to hear a corollary relief proceeding if
    either spouse were ordinarily resident in the province or if both former
    spouses accepted the jurisdiction of the court. Parliament did not intend
    to give Canadian courts jurisdiction over foreign divorces. As Professor
    Hovius correctly noted [in <i>Family Law: Cases, Notes and Materials</i>,
    4th ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 1996)], Parliament’s jurisdiction over support
    is ancillary to its jurisdiction over divorce pursuant to s. 91 of the <i>Constitution
    Act</i>, <i>1867</i>. Any attempt to deal with support obligations in the
    absence of a Canadian divorce would encroach on provincial jurisdiction (Section
    92, “Property and Civil Rights”).</p>

    that former spouse in this context must refer to a person divorced in Canada
    for two reasons: i) because s. 5 of the <i>Family Law Act</i> requires that
    the entitlement to an equalization be determined “when a divorce is granted”;
    and ii) because “former spouse” has been consistently interpreted by Canadian

    in <i>Rothgiesser v. Rothgiesser</i>,<i> supra</i>,<i> </i>concerning the
    interpretation of the current version s. 4 of the <i>Divorce Act</i> are
    binding. She notes that there are no qualifications in s. 4 of the <i>Divorce
    Act</i>; rather, it provides simply that a court has jurisdiction to hear
    a corollary relief proceeding if either former spouse is resident in the
    province. Further, there is no definition of
    “former spouse” in the <i>Divorce Act, </i>restricting that phrase to persons
    divorced in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    . Moreover, s. 22(1) of the<i> Divorce Act</i> provides that a foreign divorce
    that is recognized as valid “shall be recognized for all purposes of determining
    the marital status in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    of any person”. Relying on a plain reading of the <i>Divorce Act</i>, Ms.
    Okmyansky submits that as she is a resident of

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for her equalization claim, Ms. Okmyansky submits that there is no requirement
    in the<i> Family Law Act</i> that an application for equalization be made
    before a divorce is granted. On the contrary, s. 7 specifically permits an
    application by a former spouse. As with the<i> Divorce Act</i>, there is
    no definition of former spouse in the <i>Family Law Act</i>. Even if there
    is a rationale for interpreting the jurisdiction provisions of the <i>Divorce
    Act</i> restrictively, there is no similar rationale for interpreting the
    term
    “former spouse” restrictively as it relates to property claims under the <i>Family

    s. 5 extended the jurisdiction to hear a variation proceeding to a court
    in a province where either former spouse was ordinarily resident, it is clear
    from reading the Act as a whole that this extension did not confer jurisdiction
    on Canadian courts to vary the support and custody provisions of a foreign
    divorce decree. In particular, s. 17 of the <i>Divorce Act</i> sets out a
    court’s power to vary an existing order and refers specifically to the power
    of a court to vary a “custody order” and a “support order”. “Custody order” and “support
    order” are defined in s. 2 of the <i>Divorce Act</i> by reference to the

    orders for custody and support is therefore expressly limited to orders made

    4 of the 1985 Act, which limited the jurisdiction to hear a corollary relief
    proceeding to the court that granted the divorce was amended on March 25,
    1993 by S.C. 1993, c. 8, s. 1, (the “1993 amendment”);</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='

style='font-family:Wingdings;'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>following
    the 1993 amendment, a court in a province had the same jurisdiction to hear
    and determine a corollary relief proceeding as it had to hear and determine
    a variation proceeding, <i>i.e.</i>, if either former spouse was ordinarily
    resident in the province at the commencement of the proceeding or if both
    spouses accept the jurisdiction of the court. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, when considered in the light of the legislative history of the jurisdiction
    provisions in the <i>Divorce Act</i>, the obvious purpose of the 1993 amendment
    was to bring the jurisdiction to hear and determine a corollary relief proceeding
    in to line with the jurisdiction to hear and determine a variation proceeding.
    As a result, rather than having to return to the court in the place where
    the divorce was granted, a former spouse wishing to commence a corollary
    relief proceeding can do so in the province where he or she is ordinarily
    resident. I see nothing in the legislative history of the <i>Divorce Act </i>to
    indicate that Parliament intended the 1993 amendment to confer jurisdiction
    on Canadian courts to hear and determine a corollary relief proceeding under
    the <i>Divorce Act</i> following a valid divorce in a foreign jurisdiction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
    conclusion concerning the purpose of the 1993 amendment is consistent with
    the brief references to its purpose contained in the legislative debates
    leading up to its enactment. Significantly, there is no reference in these
    debates to an intention to broaden the scope of Canadian divorce legislation
    to permit a Canadian court to make an order for corollary relief relating
    to a divorce that was granted in a foreign jurisdiction. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Rothgiesser
      v. Rothgiesser, supra</i>, this court doubted Parliament’s jurisdiction
      under s. 91 of the <i>Constitution Act, 1867</i>, to enact legislation
      dealing with support obligations in the absence of a Canadian divorce.
      The parties in this case did not make submissions concerning the extent
      of Parliament’s legislative authority under the <i>Constitution Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    even assuming that Parliament is empowered to enact a provision dealing with
    support following a foreign divorce as part of the <i>Divorce Act</i>, I
    consider it unlikely that Parliament would do so without clearly signalling
    its intention in that respect and without considering the appropriateness
    of such legislation in the context of private international law. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    example, had Parliament intended to give Canadian courts the authority to
    grant support following a foreign divorce, it is likely that Parliament would
    have considered whether it was also appropriate to enact a provision addressing
    in what circumstances a Canadian court should exercise that authority.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"

'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  As there is no indication that Parliament considered
    international law consequences when enacting the 1993 amendment and no clear
    statement in the <i>Divorce Act</i> that Parliament intended the 1993 amendment
    to confer jurisdiction on Canadian courts to deal with support following
    a foreign divorce, I conclude that was not Parliament’s intention.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    find further support for my conclusion that s. 4 does not permit a former
    spouse divorced pursuant to a foreign divorce decree to commence a corollary
    relief proceeding under the <i>Divorce Act</i> based on a consideration of
    the Act as a whole. In my view, the very description of orders for spousal
    support, custody and child support as “corollary relief” confirms Parliament’s
    intention that these orders are intended as forms of relief that are incidental
    to the granting of the divorce. If a divorce was not granted in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    , it is difficult to see how the making of a support order could properly
    be viewed as “corollary relief”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    British Columbia Court of Appeal recently considered the jurisdiction of
    a Canadian court to hear and determine a corollary relief proceeding under
    the <i>Divorce Act</i> following a foreign divorce in <i>L.R.V. v. A.V.V.</i> (2006),
    264 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 524. After considering the legislative history
    of the jurisdiction provision in the 1968 Act and the 1985 Act, the court
    concluded that s. 4 of the <i>Divorce Act</i> does not confer jurisdiction
    on a Canadian court to hear and determine a corollary relief proceeding in
    such circumstances. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    and <i>G.M. v. M.A.F.</i>, [2003] R.J.Q. 2516 (Q.C.A.). However, these courts
    did not review the legislative history of the relevant provisions in either
    of those decisions and I prefer the reasoning of the British Columbia Court

    Okmyansky submits that because s. 5 of the <i>Family Law Act</i> requires
    that the entitlement to an equalization be determined when a divorce is granted,
    it is clear that the equalization provisions can only be applied in the context
    of a Canadian divorce proceeding. Further, he says that
    “former spouse” has consistently been interpreted in the case law as meaning
    a former spouse divorced in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary
    to Mr. Okmyansky’s submissions, s. 5 of the <i>Family Law Act</i> does not
    govern when an equalization application is determined; rather, it sets out
    the circumstances that trigger a spouse’s entitlement to an equalization.
    Those circumstances are: when a divorce is granted, when a marriage is declared
    a nullity and when parties separate with no reasonable prospect of cohabitation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    7 of the <i>Family Law Act </i>addresses who may apply for an equalization
    and when the application can be made. Section 7(1) expressly permits a former
    spouse to apply to the court to “determine any matter respecting the spouses’ entitlement
    under s. 5.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Significantly,
    s. 7(3) of the <i>Family Law Act </i>specifically permits an equalization
    application to be made up to 2 years following a divorce or up to six years
    following separation where there is no reasonable prospect of cohabitation,
    whichever is earlier. It is therefore apparent that the legislature contemplated
    that more than one of the s. 5 triggers will be present in many situations.
    Moreover, when ss. 7(1) and 7(3) are read in combination, it is clear that,
    subject to the limitation period, an application to determine a former spouse’s
    equalization entitlement under s. 5(1) can be made following a divorce and
    that it need not be determined “when a divorce is granted”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Okmyansky cited a number of cases as standing for the proposition that Canadian
    courts have consistently interpreted “former spouse” to mean a former spouse
    divorced in Canada: <i>Rothgiesser v. Rothgiesser, supra</i>; <i>Jahangiri-Mavaneh
    v. Taheri-Zengekani </i>(2003), 66 O.R. (3d) 272 (S.C.J.), rev’d on other
    grounds (2005), 14 R.F.L. (6<sup>th</sup>) 9 (Ont. C.A.); <i>Wlodarczyk v.
    Spriggs </i>(2000), 12 R.F.L. (5<sup>th</sup>) 241 (Sask. Unif.

    S.C.J. Fam. Ct.); <i>Mercieca v. Mercieca </i>(2002), 32 R.F.L. (5<sup>th</sup>)
    392 (Ont. S.C.J.). However, without exception, the cases upon which Mr. Okmyansky
    relies have to do with the jurisdiction to entertain proceedings under the <i>Divorce
    Act</i>. None of them relates to the interpretation of “former spouse” in
    s. 7 of the <i>Family Law Act</i>.<a href="#_ftn2"

    cases should be applied to the interpretation of “former spouse” in s. 7
    of the <i>Family Law Act</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have explained, there is a clear rationale for narrowly interpreting the
    provisions of the <i>Divorce Act</i> that govern the circumstances in which
    corollary relief orders and variation orders can be made in favour of a former
    spouse under that Act. The rationale relates primarily to the scope of the
    jurisdiction Parliament has historically chosen to exercise in the field
    of divorce. I see no similar rationale for interpreting “former spouse” in
    s. 7 of the <i>Family Law Act</i> as referring only to former spouses who
    were divorced in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    . On the contrary, in my view, such an interpretation would make no sense.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    15 of the <i>Family Law Act</i> sets out the conflict of laws rule to be
    applied to the property rights of spouses arising out of the marital relationship.
    It provides that they are to be governed by the internal law of the place “where
    both spouses had their last common habitual residence”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If “former
    spouse” in s. 7 were interpreted as referring only to former spouses who
    were divorced in Canada, it would mean that a person living in Ontario whose
    property rights are governed by Ontario law would have no remedy in Ontario
    concerning Ontario property where the person’s spouse is able to obtain a
    divorce in a foreign jurisdiction. This would be the case even though the
    property issues were not dealt with in the foreign proceedings. In my view,
    such a result is inconsistent with the legislative intent expressed in the
    conflict of laws provision (s. 15) and would make no sense. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
