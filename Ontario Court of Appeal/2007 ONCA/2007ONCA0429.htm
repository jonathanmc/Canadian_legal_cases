style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant/father appeals the decision of Magda J. dated September 18, 2006
    dismissing his motion for leave to bring a motion for access to his son,
    Troy, 12 years of age.  Magda J., in an earlier disposition dated March 9,
    2006, had ordered that the father required leave of the court to take any
    further step in a proceeding.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge refused to grant leave because, as he said in his ruling, “the
    costs previously ordered have not been paid and I certainly would not consider
    permitting leave to bring any further actions in this matter until those
    costs are paid.”  He ordered that the father’s motion for leave “shall not
    be renewed until the outstanding costs have been paid.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    record does not indicate there were any unpaid costs.  The costs the motion
    judge seems to have had in mind stem from his order of March 9, 2006, in
    which he indicated the father was to pay the mother’s costs on a substantial
    indemnity scale.  He directed the mother’s lawyer to submit a bill of costs
    for his consideration, with a copy to the father.  Before us, counsel for
    the mother conceded the bill of costs he provided to the father included
    services well beyond the scope of the motion of March 9, 2006 and were calculated
    on a full indemnity not a substantial indemnity basis.  These bills were
    never considered by the motion judge and he had never made a specific costs
    order.  This is a sufficient reason to set aside his decision.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    in our view, it is an error in law to bar a parent from seeking access to
    a child on the sole ground of unpaid costs without considering the amount
    of costs, the reasons they were unpaid, and the parent’s ability to pay.  The
    motion judge did not turn his mind to these considerations.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    father was injured in 1989 and lives on a modest disability pension.  Counsel
    for the mother recognized he would have great difficulty paying a costs order
    from his income.  The father does own his own home, having paid off his mortgage
    from the settlement received as a result of his injury.  Whether he should
    have been required to encumber his home, his only asset, in order to seek
    access to his son ought to have been considered by the motion judge in all
    the circumstances of the case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge’s decision refusing the father leave to bring his motion cannot
    stand and is set aside.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    are several troubling aspects of this unusual case that, while not pertinent
    to the main issue raised by this appeal, are relevant to the relief we grant.  They
    lead us to grant the father leave to bring his motion instead of remitting
    that motion to be reconsidered by the Superior Court, and to order access
    without supervision in the interim.  </p>

    Troy born August 22, 1994.  They separated in September, 1997 and have been

    they agreed that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City

    Troy would live with his father and that Tamara would live with her mother. 
    <st1:City

    September 14, 2004, the parties entered into a detailed consent order granting
    among other things, custody of
    <st1:City

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Troy to the father and custody of Tamara to the mother.  The consent order
    provided that the father could have additional access to Tamara but only
    upon Tamara’s expressed wishes.  The order provided for the mother’s access
    to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Troy on alternate weekends and stipulated that the father “deliver”
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Troy to the mother’s home for such access.  The consent order then states:</p>

    term evidently reflected the difficulties the mother had been experiencing
    in exercising access to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Troy.  Prior to the consent order, the mother had brought a motion to find
    the father in contempt for impeding her access to

    is troubling that the court allowed the motion to proceed <i>ex parte</i> on

    father would take steps to remove
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Troy from the jurisdiction if she gave him notice of the motion.  She disclosed
    no basis for this belief, and in view of the father’s financial situation,
    his ability to leave the jurisdiction seems implausible.  She never did file
    a response to the father’s subsequent accusation she had misled the court.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    third troublesome aspect is that the matter did not return before the court

    order in force during the delay.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    December 17, 2004, MacDougall J. noted the close relationship between the
    father and son, but concluded the father did not have a proper understanding
    and appreciation of his parental obligations to his son to ensure he had
    a relationship with his mother.  Before MacDougall J., the Children’s Lawyer
    representing Troy advised the court that “Troy’s wishes remain as they have
    always been i.e. to reside with his father and have regular contact with
    his mother and sister”, but took the position that it would not be in Troy’s
    best interests to be in the father’s care and custody full time as he would
    not have the benefit of important relationships with his mother and sister.  MacDougall
    J. refused to return
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    Troy to the father’s primary care for the singular good reason that the father
    was not a positive force encouraging
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Troy’s relationship with his mother.  MacDougall J. requested the Children’s
    Lawyer to obtain a “social work assist” to assist the court in considering
    whether it was in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Troy’s best interest to return to live with his father in the longer term.  Subsequently,
    the Children’s Lawyer declined to provide such an assist.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>MacDougall
    J.’s endorsement of December 17, 2004 does not refer to the non-contact order
    and provides no reasons why it should have been left in place.  However,
    he did continue the order of September 28, 2004, and the formal order taken
    out continued the non-contact term.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    father’s continued efforts to regain custody and access to his son culminated
    in the two orders of the motion judge referred to above.  While it seems
    the father has seen his son occasionally under supervision, the non-contact
    order remains in effect.  It was most recently renewed by the motion judge’s
    order dated March 9, 2006, by which he gave custody of
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Troy to the mother, and amended the September 28, 2004 order of MacDougall
    J. to include Tamara in the non-contact provision.  The motion judge further
    ordered that the husband required leave of the court to take any further
    steps in the matter.  Then on September 18, 2006, the judge made the order
    from which this appeal is taken, dismissing the father’s motion for leave
    to bring the motion for access to his son.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the mother agrees that the only final order made in this proceeding is
    the consent order of September 14, 2004.  There have been material changes
    of circumstances since that order was made.  The father was given custody
    of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Troy by that order and is now not permitted to contact
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Troy.  The transfer of custody from the father to the mother if the father
    impeded the mother’s access was provided for by the consent order.  However,
    that order did not contemplate that the father would not have access or would
    be prohibited from having contact with his son. </p>

    overarching troublesome aspect of this case is the various court orders have
    not achieved the court’s stated objective in removing Troy from the care
    and control of his father, namely to ensure that Troy have the opportunity
    to develop healthy relationships with both parents.</p>

    non-contact order is difficult to understand as the father has never been
    described by an independent assessor as anything but a good father to his
    child.  His only failing, identified by Macdougall J., was his inability
    to understand the importance of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Troy having a relationship with his mother.  The mother recognized the father’s
    parenting ability by agreeing, in 2004, to the father having custody of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Troy.  The mother’s subsequent position, for example in her affidavit dated
    April 15, 2005 stating Troy did not wish to have access to his father, is
    reminiscent of the father’s earlier allegations of Troy’s attitude towards
    his mother.  Bearing in mind the mother’s groundless affidavit filed to obtain
    the <i>ex parte</i> order, we are hesitant to attach weight to the mother’s
    vague allusion of a current problem between
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Troy and his father.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is scant evidence that the mother has encouraged
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Troy to visit his father on a regular basis, as Macdougall J. believed she
    would.  On the other hand, in a more recent report dated March 7, 2006, Dr.
    Gregory L. Carter, psychologist, reviewed the limited available evidence
    related to matters of access and was satisfied that Troy’s expressed and
    genuine wishes were to reunite with his father, though he suggested a more
    extensive assessment be undertaken.  </p>

    of the court’s orders in the record or reasons for those orders indicate
    any reason for imposing the non-contact provision.  None state any reason
    why the father should be denied access to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Troy.  None indicate why the father’s access should be supervised. </p>

    the appeal is allowed.  The judgment of Magda J. dated September 18, 2006
    is set aside.  Leave is granted to the appellant to bring his motion for
    access to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Troy to be determined by a different judge.  We order that the father have
    interim and unsupervised access to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Troy.  Given the lack of independent information about
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Troy’s current attitude, situation and schedule, we approach interim access
    cautiously and urge the Superior Court to consider what is appropriate interim
    access on an expedited basis. Until further order of the Superior Court,
    the father will have access to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Troy one day each weekend between the hours of noon and 5 p.m. commencing
    the weekend following the release of this decision.  The parties, through
    counsel, may choose which day on the weekend best suits

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Troy’s schedule.  Costs are awarded to the appellant in the amount of $5,000
    inclusive of disbursements and GST payable forthwith.</p>
