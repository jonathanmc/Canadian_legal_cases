    West GPI Limited (“Downtown West”) appeals from the judgment of Belobaba
    J. dated August 25, 2006. Before Belobaba J., Downtown West sought a declaration
    that one of its commercial properties in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto was an “eligible property” for the purposes of municipal taxation
    pursuant to s. 447.34.1 of the <i>Municipal Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.45.
    In his brief reasons, Belobaba J. refused to grant a declaration stating,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>But for the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Yonge
      Street Hotels</i> (May 4, 2005) and in particular the statement in para.
      12 therein, I would have been inclined to agree with Mr. Spence that the
      Property herein satisfied the statutory definition of “eligible property” as
      applied to the facts of this case.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>However, I am obviously bound by <i>Yonge Street
      Hotels</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The application is therefore dismissed. By agreement,
    costs are fixed in the amount of $3,000 all inclusive, payable by the applicant
    forthwith.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application before Belobaba J. was based upon an agreed statement of facts
    which is attached hereto as Schedule A.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his reasons, Belobaba J. referred to para. 12 of <i>Yonge Street Hotels Ltd.
    v. Municipal Property Assessment Corporation, Region No. 9 and The City of
    Toronto</i>, (2005), 197 O.A.C. 11 which reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In 2000, s. 447.34.1 was enacted to ensure that
    certain eligible properties were taxed at a level of assessment no higher
    than that of comparable properties. “Eligible property” is defined in s.
    447.34.1 as property to which s. 447.10(2) applies for certain specified
    years. Section 447.10  provides for adjustments to assessment arising “as
    a result of the erection, alteration, enlargement or improvement of a building”.
    Section 447.10(3) provides a special rule for increases resulting from the
    alteration, enlargement, or improvement of a building, but specifically not
    to the “erection” of a building, leaving increases resulting from the “erection” of
    a building to be dealt with under s. 447.10(2). Therefore, s. 447.10(3),
    but not s. 447.10(2), applies to buildings that have been altered, enlarged,
    or improved. Accordingly, under the definition in s. 447.34.1(16), which
    is contingent on the applicability of s. 447.10(2), buildings that have been
    altered, enlarged, or improved would not count as “eligible property” and
    do not get the benefit of the 2000 amendments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issues on appeal are as follows:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>1.What is the proper interpretation of s. 447.34.1(16) of the <i>Municipal
      Act</i>?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>2. If the <i>Yonge Street Hotels</i> case is otherwise dispositive of
    this case, was it correctly decided?</p>
  <h3>Issue 1 - What is the proper interpretation of s. 447.34.1(16) of the <i>Municipal
      Act</i>?</h3>
  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues, because the material provisions of the <i>Municipal Act</i> are
    part of Ontario’s property tax legislation, that the principles of statutory
    interpretation as enunciated in <i>Placer-Dome Canada Ltd. v. Ontario (Minister
    of Finance)</i>, 2006 SCC 20, ought to be followed. In his analysis of the
    issue, LeBel J. considered the general principles of tax statute interpretation.
    In that regard, paras. 21-24 of that decision are important and are to be
    applied in the present circumstance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted in the agreed statement of facts, the <i>Municipal Act</i> was amended
    in 1999 by adding s. 447.34.1 to Part XXII.1. The purpose of these changes
    to the <i>Municipal Act</i> was to inaugurate a municipal tax regime based
    upon current value assessment and part of the amendments included provisions
    covering the transition from the old to the new regime.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    dealing with the subject property, the City of Toronto in 1998 and in 1999
    applied the provisions of Part XXII.1 establishing for both years a “frozen
    assessment listing” (“FAL”) in accordance with s. 447.5(4). S. 447.5 reads
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>447.5(1) A local municipality shall maintain frozen
    assessment listings for the 1998, 1999 and 2000 taxation years for the taxation
    of properties to which this Part applies.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) The frozen assessment listing for 1998 shall
    be based on the assessment role for 1997, as most recently revised, including
    any assessments made under section 33 of the <i>Assessment Act</i> in respect
    of 1997, with the changes required under this Part.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3) The frozen assessment listings for 1999 and
    2000 shall be based on the frozen assessment listing for the previous year
    with the changes required under this Part.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4) The frozen assessment listing shall include
    the following for each property to which this Part applies:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Total
    assessment.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Commercial
    assessment.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Business
    assessment.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Vacant
    commercial assessment.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Non-business
    assessment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    problem underlying this appeal arose in 2000 when the Municipal Property
    Assessment Corporation (“MPAC”) delivered a “Notice of Supplementary or Omitted
    Property Assessment” pursuant to s. 33 of the <i>Assessment Act</i>. This
    notice triggered the application of s. 447.10, which provides as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>447.10(1) This section sets out the changes to
    be made to the frozen assessment listing for 1999 or 2000 if the assessment
    of a property to which this Part applies, as set out in the assessment roll
    for that year, as most recently revised, increases from the assessment set
    out in the assessment roll for the previous year as a result of, </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a) an assessment made during the previous
    year under subsection 33(1) of the Assessment Act, or</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b) an adjustment made on the assessment roll
    for the year as a result of the erection, alteration, enlargement or improvement
    of a building, a structure, machinery, equipment or a fixture that occurred
    during a previous year.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) The assessment referred to in subsection 447.5(4),
    in the frozen assessment listing for the year shall be changed as follows:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    total assessment shall be increased so that it equals the assessment set
    out in the assessment roll for the year multiplied by a factor prescribed
    in the regulations unless subsection (3) applies, in which case the total
    assessment shall be increased by the amount determined under that subsection.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    commercial assessment shall be increased by the same amount the total assessment
    was increased by under paragraph 1.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    business assessment shall be increased by the increase in the commercial
    assessment multiplied by the average business rate determined under section
    447.13.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3) If the assessment of the property is increased
    as a result of the alteration, enlargement or improvement of any building
    structure, machinery, equipment or fixture or any portion thereof, the total
    assessment shall be increased under paragraph 1 of subsection (2) by an amount
    determined in accordance with the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Amount = <i><u>increase in assessment</u>  x Frozen
      assessment              Old assessment</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“increase in assessment means the increase in the
    assessment on the assessment roll;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“Old assessment” means the assessment on the assessment
    roll before the increase;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“Frozen assessment” means the total assessment
    on the frozen assessment listing.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(7) If an assessment for a property that is made
    in a year under subsection 33(1) of the Assessment Act applies to the year
    or to either or both or the next two preceding years, the clerk of the municipality
    shall revise the frozen assessment listing for the year or for the preceding
    year or years as provided under this section and the taxes that would have
    been payable if the changes had been made to the frozen assessment listing
    in the year shall be levied and collected.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(8) If, as a result of more than one supplementary
    assessment made under section 34 of the <i>Assessment Act</i> after January
    1, 1999 in respect of a property described in paragraph 1 of subsection (4),
    the increase in the assessment on the assessment roll is equal to or greater
    than 50 per cent of the assessment of the property on the assessment roll
    prior to any of the supplementary assessments being made, subsection (4)
    does not apply to the property and the assessment on the frozen assessment
    listing shall be recalculated under subsection (2) following the supplementary
    assessment that increases the total assessment of the property on the assessment
    roll by an amount equal to or greater than 50 per cent of the assessment
    on the assessment roll.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(9) Subsections (7) and (8) apply to the 1998 and
    subsequent taxation years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is the position of the appellant that s. 447.10 ought to have been applied
    to the property in the following way.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) Because MPAC had issued its Notice of Supplementary
    or Omitted Assessment under s. 33 of the <i>Assessment Act</i>, subsections
    447.10(1) and (7) required the property’s FAL to be changed in accordance
    with the provisions of s. 447.10.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) Such changes are mandated by s. 447.10(2).
    There are three components to the FAL that are covered by this subsection.
    These are the total assessment, the commercial assessment, and the business
    assessment.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)  With respect to the total assessment, paragraph
    1 of s. 447.10(2) sets out two possible formulae for calculating the amount
    of the change. One formula is mandated for all properties, except those under
    subsection (3), and a second formula deals with properties where subsection
    (3) applies. Importantly, however, and regardless of which formula one uses,
    it is s. 447.10(2) that imposes the appropriate change to the total assessment.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(d) As to commercial and business assessments,
    the appropriate changes are set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 of s. 447.10(2).
    These changes are imposed under s. 447.10(2) <u>regardless</u> of which formula
    is used for changing the total assessment. In other words, s. 447.10(2) must
    be always be applied in order to adjust the commercial and business assessments
    because s. 447.10(3) is silent about these components of the FAL.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(e) Because the notice under s. 33 of the <i>Assessment
      Act</i> made changes for both 1999 and 2000 assessments, the rule applied
      initially for the 1999 calculations ought to be used for the 2000 calculations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant then says that the next step requires a consideration of s. 447.34.1
    of the <i>Municipal Act</i>, which was added to Part XXII.1 in 1999. Clearly,
    this section was transitional in nature and designed to ensure that “eligible” properties
    were taxed in 2000 under Part XXII.1 at a level of assessment no higher than
    that of “comparable properties”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eligible
    property is defined in s. 447.34.1(16) of the Act as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“eligible property” means a property to which subsection
    447.10(2),</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(f) first applied for 1998 or 1999 and continues
    to apply for 2000, or</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(g) applies for 2000 and did not apply for
    1999,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>and includes such other property as may be
    prescribed under clause (15)(a); </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the proper interpretation of s. 447.34(1) is that the
    subject property was indeed an “eligible property” in accordance with that
    section. In 1999, subsection 447.10(2) applied to the property and should
    continue to apply in 2000. It is the appellant’s position that this interpretation
    gives effect to the grammatical and ordinary sense of the statutory wording,
    read in context, and that no other interpretation makes sense of the words.
    We agree. Because no ambiguity exists and because there is precision and
    clarity in the taxing provision, the provision must be applied. (See <i>Placer
    Dome</i> , <i>supra</i>.)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Very
    simply put, any final assessment of the subject property cannot be determined
    under s. 447.10 without applying subsection (2). Without doubt, in the present
    case subsection (3) applies to determine the increase in
    “total assessment” which is then used to determine the increase in commercial
    and business assessment under subsection (2). Nevertheless, subsection (2)
    applies in completing the task of determining the assessments after the improvements
    have been made to the property. In our view, there is no ambiguity. The statute
    simply does not make any sense in the current fact situation if subsection
    447.10(2) is not applied. The three components of the FAL that are in issue
    can only be changed by using that subsection.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Belobaba
    J. properly felt himself constrained by <i>Yonge Street Hotels Ltd. v. Municipal
    Property Assessment Corporation, Region No 9 in the City of Toronto</i>,
    (2005), 197 O.A.C. 11, although one senses his reluctance in coming to the
    conclusion he did. Nonetheless, for the reasons we have given, we reach the
    opposite result and would allow the appeal. In doing so, it is important
    that we make clear the context in which this court commented upon s. 447.34.1
    in <i>Yonge Street Hotels</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There,
    the appellant had purchased the former Westbury Hotel on
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Yonge Street in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto and then stripped everything away but the shell. A construction retrofit
    was carried out and a new hotel was built within the existing structural
    element. It was the contention of the appellant that its construction work
    had amounted to the “erection” of a new building, while MPAC argued that
    it amounted to an
    “improvement” of an existing building. The common ground presented to the
    court in <i>Yonge Street Hotels</i> makes it an entirely different case from
    the one before us. In a joint submission, the parties in <i>Yonge Street
    Hotels</i> stated that the hotel in question would only be “an eligible property” if
    it was erected as a new building, with the result that the dispute centred
    around what constituted “erection” as opposed to “alteration, enlargement
    or improvement”. Given the joint submission and the common ground of the
    parties in <i>Yonge Street Hotels</i>, this court was not assisted with the
    debate about the proper meaning of s. 447.34.1, but rather was presented
    with an agreed meaning. In that sense, it is unnecessary for us to find that <i>Yonge
    Street Hotels</i> was incorrectly decided. It was very much restricted to
    its facts in light of the common ground presented by the parties.</p>
