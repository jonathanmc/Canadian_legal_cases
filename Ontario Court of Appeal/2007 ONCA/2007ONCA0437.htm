  <h2>A.        OVERVIEW</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant, Marcel Gabris, appeals his conviction for robbery.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    November 17, 2003, at approximately eight o’clock in the evening, the complainant
    went to a Money Mart store in
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto where he purchased two money orders worth $1,000.  Mr. Gabris was
    in the store at the same time to cash a cheque and was accompanied by his
    co-accused.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown alleged that just after the complainant left the store, Mr. Gabris
    and his co-accused approached him from behind demanding money.  When the
    complainant refused to comply, the co-accused pushed him against a concrete
    pillar and told Mr. Gabris to rob him.  Mr. Gabris went through the complainant’s
    pockets and stole between $10 and $20, but did not take the money orders.  A
    passer-by shouted at both accused and they ran off.  The complainant called
    the police.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Both
    Mr. Gabris and his co-accused denied robbing the complainant.  Mr. Gabris
    testified that on leaving the Money Mart store, the co-accused asked the
    complainant for a cigarette to which the complainant replied, “Get a job.”  The
    co-accused and the complainant then began arguing and swearing at each other.  Eventually
    the co-accused called the complainant a “Paki.”  The two accused then left.  They
    contended that the complainant called the police to get back at them for
    uttering a racial slur.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, the only witnesses were the complainant and the two accused.  Identity
    was not in question.  The sole issue was whether the robbery took place.  The
    trial judge rejected the defence evidence, accepted the complainant’s evidence
    and convicted both accused.  He sentenced Mr. Gabris to thirty days in custody
    (plus twenty-one days of pre-trial custody) and twelve months probation.  </p>
  <h2>B.        THE ISSUES</h2>
  <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Gabris argued four grounds of appeal against conviction: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(1)       The trial judge erred in failing to find
    that Mr. Gabris’ right to a trial within a reasonable time under s. 11(b)
    of the <i>Charter</i> was infringed; </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(2)       The trial judge failed to take account
    of numerous inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(3)       The trial judge misapplied the burden
    of proof; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(4)       The verdict was unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    called on the Crown to respond to the second and third grounds of appeal.  On
    the first ground, we were not persuaded that the trial judge erred in holding
    that on the facts of this case, the twenty-month delay for a trial in the
    Ontario Court of Justice did not violate Mr. Gabris’ s. 11(b) <i>Charter</i> right.  On
    the fourth ground of appeal, the evidence of the complainant could support
    the conviction and therefore, the verdict was not unreasonable.  </p>
  <h2>C.        ANALYSIS</h2>
  <h2>            1.         Failure to deal with inconsistencies in the complainant’s
    evidence.</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Gabris’ main attack on the trial judge’s reasons focuses on his failure to
    deal with the many inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence.  Mr. Gabris
    has accurately set out these inconsistencies at para. 43 of his factum.  They
    are numerous.  Some of these inconsistencies are between the complainant’s
    evidence at trial and his earlier statement to the police; some are within
    the complainant’s own evidence at trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge did acknowledge that “there were differences to some extent in
    what the complainant testified to and what he said to the police.”  Beyond
    this acknowledgment, however, the trial judge did not address these “differences” in
    his reasons.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Of
    course, trial judges are not required to deal expressly with every inconsistency
    in the evidence.  Trial judges should, however, address contradictory evidence
    on key or material points.  See <i>R. v. Stark</i> (2004), 190 C.C.C. (3d)
    496 at paras. 12-13 (Ont.
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Here,
    there were several key inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence, which
    the trial judge failed to address.  For example: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, the complainant testified that Mr. Gabris stared at him and looked
    at him in a threatening manner while inside the Money Mart store.  Yet, in
    the complainant’s statement to the police – which he acknowledged was given
    shortly after the incident, was given when he was not upset and was accurate – the
    complainant did not say that Mr. Gabris stared at him or looked at him in
    a threatening way.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, the complainant testified that Mr. Gabris took cash and receipts for
    the money orders from him.  Yet, in his statement, when the police asked
    him, “Did they take anything,” he answered, “No.”</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, the complainant testified that Mr. Gabris went through his pockets.  In
    his statement, the complainant did not say that anyone went through his pockets.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his examination in chief, the complainant testified that Mr. Gabris got into
    a taxi and left the scene by the time the police had arrived.  In cross-examination,
    however, the complainant acknowledged that Mr. Gabris was still standing
    outside a nearby store when the police arrived, and only later left in a
    taxi after the police had not detained him.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>All
    these inconsistencies are material; two are critical because they go to the
    question whether the complainant was robbed.  In our view, the trial judge’s
    failure to deal with these inconsistencies deprived Mr. Gabris of a fair
    trial.  On this ground alone, we would allow the appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Adding
    to the unfairness is the trial judge’s comparative treatment of the defence’s
    evidence.  Although the trial judge did not address important inconsistencies
    in the Crown’s case, he did fasten on one fairly unimportant inconsistency
    in Mr. Gabris’ evidence concerning who left the Money Mart store first, and
    used it as basis to reject his evidence.</p>
  <h2>2.         Misapplication of the burden of proof.</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Gabris contends that the trial judge failed to apply <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i> (1991),
    63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.), properly and instead treated the case as a credibility
    contest.  The trial judge certainly referred to <i>W.(D.)</i> and correctly
    reminded himself that, “[i]t is not a contest of who is believed because
    that would appear to detract one’s thinking from the test of it being proved
    beyond a reasonable doubt.  That is always the test.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    the trial judge came to analyze the evidence, however, he said, “[I]n these
    particular pieces of evidence, either there was a robbery or there wasn’t.  There
    is no other alternative here.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    passage is troubling because it does suggest that the trial judge failed
    to turn his mind to the middle ground, whether there was a reasonable doubt
    a robbery occurred.  Nonetheless, we need not decide whether the trial judge’s
    application of <i>W.(D.)</i> warrants reversal.  His failure to address the
    important inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence entitles Mr. Gabris
    to a new trial.</p>
  <h2>D.        CONCLUSION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    allow the conviction appeal, set aside the conviction and order a new trial.</p>
