  <h2><span style='font-weight:normal;'>R.A. BLAIR J.A.:</span></h2>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Forbes seeks to set aside the order of Justice Whitten dated December 6,
    2006 dismissing his motion to set aside a default judgment issued in this
    action on July 24, 2006 and permitting him to serve and file a statement
    of defence and counterclaim.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    his behalf Mr. Murray made essentially two submissions.  First, he contended
    that the motion judge erred in failing to hold that the appellant’s delay
    in responding to service of the statement of claim was adequately explained.  Secondly,
    he argues that the motion judge erred in failing to hold that a triable defence
    on the issue of duress had been made out.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    do not agree, and for the reasons that follow would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h2>Applicable Principles</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is no dispute as to the applicable principles.  In exercising his or her
    discretion pursuant to Rule 19.08 to set aside a default judgment, the motion
    judge should consider (a) whether the motion was brought without delay after
    learning of the default; (b) whether the circumstances giving rise to the
    default were adequately explained; and, (c) whether there is an arguable
    defence on the merits: <i>Morgan v. Toronto (Municipality) Police Services
    Board</i> (2003), 34 C.P.C. (5<sup>th</sup>) 46 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 19.  A
    motion judge is entitled to considerable deference in the exercise of that
    discretion, and a decision of this nature will not be set aside unless there
    has been some error in law or principle, or a palpable and overriding error
    of fact, or unless the decision is so clearly wrong as to amount to an injustice:
    see, for example, <i>Sinnadurai v. Laredo Construction Inc.</i> (2005), 20
    C.P.C. (6<sup>th</sup>) 234 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
  <h2>Facts</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant is in the business of selling and moving houses.  In December 2004
    he agreed to sell a house to the respondent’s common-law spouse, Nancy Tewisha,
    and to move it to a site on the Six Nations Reserve for a total price of
    $47,000.  The monies were paid in advance.  After some delays, the house
    was moved to the Reserve at the end of September, 2005.  At that time the
    respondent and Ms. Tewisha rejected the home – there was a provision in the
    Purchase Agreement entitling them to do so on certain grounds – and demanded
    the return of their monies.  The appellant alleges that the respondent refused
    to allow him to take his heavy moving equipment off the property unless he
    first agreed to repay the purchase monies and other expenses and to enter
    into the “Collection Agreement” on which this action is based.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Collection Agreement was entered into on October 5, 2005.  It called for
    a first repayment of $10,000 and thirteen subsequent payments of $3,000 over
    the ensuing 3 ½ months, with a final payment of $1,000 on January 12, 2006 – a
    total of $50,000.  The payments were not made.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Hill commenced this action and served the statement of claim on Mr. Forbes
    on May 1, 2006.  There was no response.  The appellant was noted in default
    on June 5, 2006.  He saw a solicitor on June 14 and gave him a retainer cheque
    for $2,000 but the cheque bounced.  Still having heard nothing, the plaintiff
    obtained default judgment on July 24, 2006.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant moved to set aside the default judgment on October 10, 2006.</p>
  <h2>Delay</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the issues of delay and the explanation for the delay, the motion judge considered
    the appellant’s position and rejected his arguments that his delayed reaction
    was attributable either to the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Caledonia blockade situation or to an inability to retain counsel sooner.  There
    was ample support in the record for that conclusion and I can see no basis
    for interfering with it.  Although his retainer cheque was returned NSF,
    the appellant’s banking records show that he had deposited funds within days
    of the cheque having been returned NSF in an amount more than adequate to
    cover the amount.  Further, he was operating with at least some form of overdraft
    protection if he made the request for that protection.  He made no such request.  His
    answers on cross-examination made it clear that the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Caledonia blockade in no way interfered with his ability to respond to the
    proceedings.</p>
  <h2>Economic Duress</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant next submitted that he raised a triable defence of economic duress
    in relation to the “Collection Agreement”.  The motion judge rejected this
    submission, stating:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>According to
    the defendant this was under duress.  The circumstances he raises would not
    amount to “duress” certainly not in either criminal law or civil law.  The
    time elapsed of 5 days would undermine if not eclipse the possibility of
    duress as the parties had plenty of time to contemplate their situation.  A
    bold assertion of “duress” in these circumstances is not a defence. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant filed an affidavit on the motion.  In that affidavit he did not
    deal specifically with the matter of duress, except to the extent that he
    swore the allegations contained in his draft proposed statement of defence
    and counterclaim were true.  In paragraph 13 of that document he alleges
    that the Collection Agreement “was signed under duress for the reasons set
    out above and is without legal force”.  Mr. Murray stated that the factual
    underpinnings for that plea were the allegations that the Defendant barricaded
    the moving equipment of the Seller (para. 10) and that “[t]he plaintiff knew
    that the Seller was contracted to move another home at 98 Valleyview Drive,
    Ancaster, the following week, and needed its equipment to do so” (para. 11). </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    am not persuaded that a triable defence of economic duress is made out on
    those facts.  In <i>Stott v. Merit Investment Corporation</i>, 1988 CarswellOnt
    887 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) Finlayson J.A. said, at para 48:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>The term “economic duress” as used in recent cases, particularly in England,
    is no more than a recognition that in our modern life the individual is subject
    to societal pressures which can be every bit as effective, if improperly
    used, as those flowing from threats of physical abuse.  It is an expansion
    in kind but not class of practices that the law already recognizes as unacceptable
    such as those resulting from undue influence or from persons in authority.  <u>But
    not all pressure, economic or otherwise, is recognized as constituting duress.  It
    must be a pressure which the law does not regard as legitimate and it must
    be applied to such a degree as to amount to “a coercion of the will”, to
    use an expression found in English authorities, or it must place the party
    to whom the pressure is directed in a position where he has no “realistic
    alternative” but to submit to it, to adopt the suggestion of Professor Waddams</u> (S.M.
    Waddams, <i>The Law of Contract</i> (2<sup>nd</sup> ed., 1984), at p. 376
    et seq.).  Duress has the effect of vitiating consent and an agreement obtained
    through duress is voidable at the instance of the part subjected to the duress
    unless by another agreement or through conduct, either express or implied,
    he affirms the impugned contract at a time when he is no longer the victim
    of duress [underlining added].</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Stott</i>,
    however, the fact of economic pressure – even pressure that could not be
    recognized in law as legitimate – was not sufficient in itself to establish
    the defence of duress, because the plaintiff had other practical alternatives.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Here,
    the fact that the respondent is said to have barricaded the appellant’s equipment,
    knowing that he needed it for a job the next week, is not sufficient to give
    rise to a triable issue.  More is needed.  The appellant does not say that
    he sought advice, or considered – much less brought – legal proceedings to
    recover his equipment.  He says he contacted the police, who would do nothing.  But
    this is not a matter for the police; it is a civil matter that could have
    been resolved by a motion for the interim recovery of his property.  The
    fact that five days had expired before the Collection Agreement was signed,
    as the motion judge noted, is also significant.   There is no basis for saying
    any pressure the appellant may have felt was of such a nature as to deprive
    him of “his freedom of exercising his will”: <i>Stott, supra</i>, at para
    49, citing <i>Pao On v. Lau Yiu</i>, [1980] A.C. 614 (P.C.).  Finally, the
    appellant did not raise any concerns about the agreement for over a year
    following its signature.  He simply ignored it and made none of the payments
    contemplated.</p>
  <h2>Other Matters</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant also alleged in his proposed statement of defence and counterclaim
    that “reasons for refusal” set out in the Collection Agreement were untrue
    and that the real reason the respondent and Ms. Tewisha rejected the home
    was because they discovered they could not convert it into a two-storey building.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Murray did not raise this issue in argument, but the court asked Mr. Sheppard
    to respond to it, having regard to the triable defence requirement.  In the
    end, the point does not assist the appellant.  The reasons for rejection
    of the house are relevant to the initial Purchase Agreement but not to the
    Collection Agreement unless it could be said that there was no consideration
    whatsoever for the latter.  Such an allegation is not made out on the facts.  Motive
    has little, if anything, to do with consideration.</p>
  <h2>Disposition</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed with costs payable to the
    respondent and fixed in the amount of $4,500 inclusive of fees, disbursements
    and GST.</p>
