    receiving is a disability pension and pursuant to this court’s decision in <i>Lowe v. Lowe</i> (2006), 78 O.R. (3d) 760
    (C.A.), it is to be excluded from the equalization of net family property calculations.  Alternatively, the appellant argues that the
    pension should be excluded from the calculation pursuant to s. 4(2)3 of the <i>Family Law Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3 (“FLA”),
    as the pension constitutes “damages” and is therefore to be excluded from the

style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Both parties appeared without lawyers at trial
    and at this appeal.  As noted by the
    trial judge, the result was that “the court was given little or no evidence or
    information on several material items.  In particular, the [appellant] failed to call any evidence to explain
    the nature and details of his ‘disability income’.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After a thorough review of the case law and
    evidence led at trial, the trial judge concluded as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left'>[B]ased upon my review of the relevant legislation and case law and the
    best evidence that is available to the Court, I find that the income that the
    [appellant] is receiving has the attributes of a retirement pension and is not
    a disability pension or disability income and is therefore property within the
    meaning of the <i>FLA</i> and subject to
    equalization.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, the record fully supports the trial
    judge’s finding.  The appellant had
    almost eighteen years of service with the Federal government when he resigned
    in 1991. Of these eighteen years, approximately fourteen and a half years were
    served within the period of the marriage.  In 1997, at the age of fifty-six, the appellant became disabled.  Under the Federal government pension plan
    into which he had contributed, the appellant became entitled to a disability
    pension.  This disability pension was, in
    essence, an entitlement to take early retirement without penalty.  But for his disability, the appellant would
    have had to wait until he was sixty years of age before being entitled to draw
    an unreduced pension.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At trial, information from the Superannuation, Pension
    Transition and Client Services Sector of Public Works and Government and Services
    Canada was filed.  This material
    describes how the <i>Pension Benefits
    Division Act</i>, S.C. 1992, C.46 Sch. II provided for the division of the
    appellant’s pension benefits without affecting his disability pension.  The relevant paragraphs from the document
    read as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left'>It is important to note that the valuation date under the <i>Pension Benefits Division Act</i> (PBDA) is
    the date of the division payment and only future entitlements are included in
    the valuation.  In addition, only
    benefits acquired during the period subject to division are included in the
    valuation.  If the PBDA payment had been
    made in May 1999, the valuation for purposes of the PBDA would be based on the
    annuity for the period subject to division (14 ½ years) payable from age 60.  The maximum permissible payment would be 50%
    of that value.  The benefits payable
    between the valuation date and age 60 due to disability would be ignored.  Similarly, the reduction to the plan member
    (i.e. ½ of the annuity related to the 14 ½ year period of service) would only
    apply starting at age 60.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>If, on the other
    hand, the PBDA payment were being made at this time, it would be no different than
    if the member had retired with an entitlement to a differed annuity payable at
    age 60.  That is because the member is
    now over the age of 60.  As noted above,
    only future benefits are included in the valuation so the fact that the member
    had received benefits prior to age 60 would now be irrelevant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By the time of trial, the appellant was over
    sixty years of age.  Therefore, although
    his pension was still called a disability pension, it had in effect become a
    retirement pension.  The amount of this
    pension was approximately the same amount as he would have received at the age
    of sixty but for his disability.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As a result, the value at the date of separation
    of the pension entitlement acquired by the appellant during the marriage was properly
    included by the trial judge in the equalization of net family property
    calculations.  The trial judge was
    careful to include only the value of the pension entitlement at age sixty in
    the calculation.  For purposes of
    calculation, therefore, the value of the disability benefits that the appellant
    was entitled to receive up until age sixty were excluded.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, this case is quite different from
    the case of <i>Lowe </i>to which we were
    referred.  In that decision, this court
    found that disability benefits paid by the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board
    were not family property for purposes of equalization.  As noted in that decision, however,
    disability payments that form part of an employee benefit plan, such as the one
    in the present case, “may be on a different footing”: see <i>Lowe</i> at paras. 17 and 24.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, the trial judge adopted the correct
    approach based on the record before him.  My understanding of his order is that the value of the appellant’s
    disability pension, up to age sixty, was excluded from the equalization of net
    family property calculation.  Only one
    half of the appellant’s retirement pension entitlement acquired during the
    course of the marriage was valued and transferred to the respondent.  The appellant has been left with the other
    half of the retirement pension entitlement acquired during the years of the
    marriage as well as 100% of the entitlement he had earned prior to the
    marriage.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I also see no error in the trial judge’s finding
    that the pension did not constitute “damages” as provided in s. 4(2)3 of the<i> </i>FLA.  As I have noted, the trial judge ensured that the disability portion of
    the pension was excluded from the calculation.</p>
  <h2><u>Other issues</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As to the appellant’s claim for spousal support
    from the respondent, I find no error.  The trial judge recognized that in 1997 the appellant became disabled, entitling
    him to a disability pension.  However, as
    noted by the trial judge, the appellant led virtually no medical evidence of
    his condition at the date of trial or in the years preceding trial.  Therefore, the <span style='font-family:&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;
letter-spacing:1.0pt'>record simply did not support
    the appellant’s claim that</span> at the date of trial he continued to be disabled
    and unable to work.  It was open to the
    trial judge to conclude that the appellant was</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left'>attempting to artificially manufacture a medical condition so that he can
    delay these proceedings or to support his claim for support from the wife.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left'>This conclusion is reinforced by my assessment of the husband during the
    trial.  …</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left'>Based upon the above, I have serious questions about the credibility of
    the husband and his veracity.  Accordingly, I find that he is purposively unemployed and dismiss his
    claim for spousal maintenance.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>On this record I see no
    reason to interfere with that finding.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With respect to the appellant’s submission that

      <st1:place w:st="on">

    does not establish the existence of such a debt.  I find no basis to vary the order in this
    regard.</p>

line-height:normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As a result, I would dismiss the appeal and
